Environment and Energy Policy research fellow at the Heartland Institute, H. Sterling Burnett, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday regarding President Trump’s position on the Paris Climate Agreement. The Heartland Institute has called for the United States to withdraw.

The press release reads in part:

The Paris Climate Treaty puts America last, the exact opposite of what candidate Trump and now President Trump has promised. The treaty would require the United States to make massive reductions in emissions and pay billions of dollars in ‘climate reparations’ to Third World dictators, while requiring no emission cuts from developing countries including India and China. Why should the United States pay hundreds of billions of dollars to developing countries at a time when the U.S. government is running massive debts, when economic growth is slower for a longer period of time than at any time since the Great Depression, and when American workers are losing out to lower-paid workers in China and India?

Burnett said Wednesday, “Trump rightly said he was going to withdraw from this, but … there are two factions in the White House. There are those like Scott Pruitt, head of the EPA, like Steve Bannon, his adviser, that say keep your campaign promise. Withdraw from the Paris Climate agreement. Let America grow.”

“But then there’s the other faction,” he continued, “that’s led by Rex Tillerson, who has a lot of influence … as secretary of state, who said we should stay in the agreement. It’s led by his daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. … She wants to make climate change her signature issue. So he’s got powerful interests trying to keep him in the agreement, saying not [to] leave it as it is, but renegotiate it. Cut a better deal.”

“Problem is, there are no terms within the treaty to cut a better deal. You’re not allowed within the treaty to cut a better deal. And the worst problem is, is there’s no better deal to be had, in the sense that if you’re forcing America to cut its emissions, you’re having big government intervene in the economy,” he concluded.

Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday’s Bretibart News Daily to talk about the crisis in North Korea, and whether the Trump administration will be able to break a cycle of provocations and negotiations that stretches back for decades.

Gaffney said things could be different this time, and maybe not in a good way, because “North Korea is now in a position to attack with horrific effect the United States itself – not just our friends and allies and forces in the region, but the continental mainland of the United States.”

“One of the ways in which they could do that, we believe, is through unleashing, perhaps via a nuclear device overhead – currently there are two North Korean satellites circling the Earth, and passing over the United States with regularity, that could conceivably house an electromagnetic pulse optimized nuclear weapon,” he explained.

If detonated, such a weapon could “take out the United States by destroying our electric grid,” an offensive capability Gaffney described as a “game-changer” even before North Korea develops nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles.

“These are real threats that are now to us, here at home,” he said. “I think that somewhat changes the ‘Groundhog Day’ exercise that we’ve been going through for decades now.”

Gaffney quoted Vice President Mike Pence talking about putting an end to “willful deception,” by which he meant “the willful deception of the North Koreans as they have entered into a succession of agreements with us, including that they would not get nuclear weapons – which of course they predictably violated with impunity.”

“In fact, they were rewarded for doing it, in subsequent negotiations and concessions made to them,” he added.

“But there’s another kind of willful blindness, or willful deception if you will, that’s operating here. And that is I believe the deception we’ve indulged in, in this country, with respect to China,” Gaffney said. “We’re endlessly told the Chinese are the solution to this problem. If only the Chinese will restrain their clients in North Korea, this problem will be at least mitigated, if not eliminated.”

He said the truth of the matter is, “the record is pretty clear that the Chinese consider bad behavior from North Korea to be a strategic asset for them.”

“Far from constraining it, I think they’re enabling it – no question about that – but I think they actually find it very expedient to use against the United States, notably as just one example in the course of conversations with Donald Trump,” he observed. “Within days of ending a campaign in which he promised to brand them – as they are – a currency manipulator, in the interest of inducing the Chinese to behave as intermediaries and constrain North Korea, the president has said ‘oh, no, no, they’re not a currency manipulator.’ I think that’s the kind of evidence of bennies that flow to the North Koreans, and principally to the Chinese, that enable the North Koreans to keep on keeping on – in fact, to become more dangerous with Chinese help.”

Marlow turned the conversation to Tuesday’s shooting rampage in Fresno, where suspect Kori Ali Muhammad targeted white victims and reportedly shouted “Allahu akbar!” as the police took him down. The Associated Press has been criticized for refusing to print the phrase as Muhammad said it, instead rendering it in English as “God is great!”

Gaffney further argued that this common translation of “Allahu akbar” is incorrect. “It means ‘Allah is greatest,’” he said. “Not God, some Abrahamic faith God, but Allah isn’t just great or even greater, he is greatest. This is the jihadist battle cry. It’s what you are supposed to say when you are killing infidels, to assure that if you’re killed in the process you’ll get credit for it as a shaheed, a martyr, a guy who is sacrificing himself for the greater glory of sharia.”

“It’s almost a parody these days that the reflexive response of law enforcement, if it isn’t ‘nothing to see here folks,’ it certainly is ‘nothing to see here in the way of sharia supremacism,’” he complained.

“Now, this guy may have a lot of other issues. Apparently he’s homeless, he hated white people – I get that. But when he says those words, you cannot ignore the fact that probably somewhere, maybe because of what he’s been hearing on the news, or maybe because of something he’s been hearing in jail, where a lot of guys are getting converted to jihad, or Muslims going in come out full-fledged jihadists. Whatever the provenance of it, you cannot ignore the fact that he probably had somewhere in his DNA this belief that it would enhance his standing with Allah, or at least advance Allah’s cause of imposing on everybody – Muslim and non-Muslim alike, by the way – this toxic ideology of sharia,” said Gaffney.

“I’ve had it, frankly, with these guys in law enforcement who are willfully blind,” he exclaimed. “We respect people doing their duties, God knows, but when they incessantly repeat this like it’s some kind of incantation, it’s a disservice to the public, and it suggests malfeasance on their part in terms of protecting us from these kinds of threats.”

Marlow next asked Gaffney about reports that the first “DREAMer” – a young illegal alien protected under President Obama’s extension of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals – has been deported under President Trump. Many view the deportation of people brought to the United States as children by their parents to be unfair, since the children had no say in the matter.

Gaffney agreed with Marlow’s proposal that DACA provides an incentive for illegal aliens to bring their children across the border, so removing that incentive will help reduce the volume of illegal border crossings.

“It is fundamentally about the rule of law,” Gaffney declared. “These happen to be particularly sympathetic characters. They didn’t, as you say, have a say in coming here – their parents brought them sometimes in utero, but nonetheless brought them here. As a result the Obama administration, and many Democrats, and a lot of Republicans for that matter, were kind of willing to look the other way as President Obama essentially waived the law and created new regulations that would enable them to stay here permanently.”

“I hope that this action isn’t one that will be countermanded by President Trump as he learns of it, probably from the news, having in the course of his campaign and I think subsequently said he would try to find a way to accommodate these people,” Gaffney continued. “It does come down to the magnet, and that’s what we’ve got to turn off. More people being attracted to come to this country – and I think to the extent that you can figure the kids at least will get a permanent place here, if you can get them across the border, is a magnet and should be turned off, along with the others.”

Marlow sought Gaffney’s take on the special referendum in Turkey that gave President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vastly increased powers, and secured him in office for over a decade to come.

“What was shocking was that he very narrowly won, which suggests to me that he had to steal a lot of votes in order to get across the 50-yard mark,” Gaffney said.

He saw Erdogan as “dead set on, and now one very important step closer to achieving, the caliphate that he has had his eyes set on since he was a young mayor in Istanbul.”

To that end, Gaffney recalled, Erdogan established an Islamist political party with his old ally Fethullah Gulen, who now lives in self-exile in the United States, and is blamed as the mastermind of all Turkish unrest by Erdogan.

“He’s trying to convert Turkey from a pro-Western, basically secular, more-or-less democratic nation into one that is now increasingly just another dangerous Islamist republic,” he warned. “And that I think is going to be bad for the Turks, it’s for sure bad for Europe, and I think will be a real problem going forward, as it has been to an extent for a while now, for the NATO alliance. Because let’s recall they are a member of NATO. They are privy to its secrets. They have access to its technology.”

“The fact that Erdogan is this president, now dictator effectively, is I fear going to be increasingly moving his country into alliances with the Islamic State, with al-Qaeda, with the Muslim Brotherhood, with Russia, with China. It makes this a very serious problem for our security interests and those of the NATO alliance, he said.

Gaffney said it was a mistake for President Trump to call Erdogan and “congratulate him on what is, in fact, a contested election.”

He was uncertain who recommended this course of action to Trump, but said “there are obviously lots of people in his administration who are inclined to think that if we just do more of what Obama did – which is try to romance, and accommodate, and even appease these sharia supremacists, and that’s what Erdogan is – that they’ll behave better.”

“I think that’s a mistake,” he judged. “I wish the president hadn’t made that call. But more to the point, I think we’re going to have to give some very serious thought, there is no institutional arrangement to decoupling a NATO ally from the alliance. We’re going to have to try to figure out how to do that because otherwise, I think we’ve got a potential enemy inside our huddle.”

President Donald Trump signed a bill to extend the Veterans Choice Program at the Oval Office on Wednesday, inviting influential veterans groups to join him.

“The veterans have poured out their sweat and blood and tears for this country for so long, and it’s time that they’re recognized, and it’s time that we now take care of them, and take care of them properly,” Trump said.

The bill allows veterans to seek private care outside of the VA system, if they live more than 40 miles away from a VA hospital or can’t get an appointment within 30 days. Trump specifically thanked Senator John McCain and Senator Johnny Isakson for their work on the bill, as well as Rep. Phil Roe, the Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.

“Some people have to travel five hours, eight hours, and they’ll have to do it on a weekly basis, and even worse than that,” Trump said. “It’s not going to happen anymore.”

Trump was joined by Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, who praised the bill.

“This is a good day for veterans,” he said. “This is a great day to celebrate not only what veterans have contributed to the country, but how we’re making things better for them.”

The extension of the bill passed by Congress authorized the sharing of medical records to hospitals outside the VA and modifies the procedures for reimbursement for private hospitals.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b87699632:2910e6d:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

U.S. Customs and Border Protection is planning to unveil a facial recognition program that will track visa holders at U.S. airports while using the same technology on drones to patrol the southern border.

The system, called Biometric Exit, is currently being tested on a one-way flight from Atlanta to Tokyo and is expected to be rolled out to more airports this summer after being expedited by the Trump Administration, according to a report from The Verge.

The current practice used by Customs and Border Protection agents is to take photos and fingerprints of every visa holder who enters the U.S., but there is no system in place to verify that a visa holder has left before their visa expires. This is where Biometric Exit comes in.

Passengers will have their photos taken at the airport before boarding flights, that photo will cross-reference with “passport-style photos provided with the visa application.” If there is no match, then that will raise flags about whether the visitor entered the United States illegally.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Larry Panetta, who is leading the airport segment of the project, said, “We currently have everyone’s photo, so we don’t need to do any sort of enrollment. We have access to the Department of State records so we have photos of US Citizens, we have visa photos, we have photos of people when they cross into the US and their biometrics are captured into [DHS biometric database] IDENT.”

President Trump expedited the implementation of Biometric Exit when he signed the executive order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,” the same document that called for the temporary halt of immigrants from seven Middle Eastern countries.

“Sec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States,” the executive order states.

The CBP is also looking to use facial recognition at the border to help identify any person that is in relevant law enforcement databases.

Officials with the CBP solicited proposals from companies for small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), like consumer drones, for deployment by Border Patrol agents along the southern border.

The agency is specifically looking for a drone that is small enough that it can fit into a truck, weighs under 55 pounds, and is deployable by a single agent in less than 5 minutes. Officials also want a drone fitted with state-of-the-art sensor technology which reportedly may include, “infrared cameras and facial-recognition capabilities.”

A document included with the solicitation, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) Capabilities, said the agency is looking for a drone that can, “distinguish between natural and artificial features, and between animals, humans, and vehicles at long range.”

The same document also states that the agency is looking for a drone that, “would have facial recognition capabilities that allow it cross-reference any persons identified with relevant law enforcement databases.”

The goal will be to cross-reference the facial scans against multiple government databases that collect biometric information, including the FBI. “The bureau can draw from over 411 million photos spread across state and federal databases, including more than 173 million driver’s license photos, as part of the new biometric effort,” according to a government document that was analyzed by The Verge.

Ari Schuler, co-lead of CBP’s Silicon Valley office, which is managing the project, said that a drone that has these capabilities would allow Border Patrol Agents to identify traffickers who have violent criminal backgrounds, allowing the Agent the call backup.

Since large portions of the border lack cellular service, the biggest challenge for contractors is figuring out how to stream data from the drones. The CBP is also looking for a drone that is secure, not vulnerable to hacking.

The move to go from large military-style drones to small consumer ones comes from the disappointment the CBP has had with the Predator. A report from 2014 shows that the cost to operate 10 Predators over the course of a year exceeded $60 million. The drones failed to lower the cost of border surveillance and were vulnerable to GPS jamming and other attacks.

Former Breitbart News National Security Editor Dr. Sebastian Gorka, now a White House national security adviser, discussed the situation in North Korea with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily.

Gorka said that “things have changed fundamentally” in the long-running impasse over North Korea’s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs, “because America is back, and because you have the master of the ‘art of the deal’ as the Commander-in-Chief.”

“If you just look at the statements coming out of Beijing, if you look at the decision with regards to purchasing U.S. coal over North Korean coal, things have fundamentally changed,” he said.

“North Korea is probably the most Stalinist state that has ever existed, probably more Stalinist than Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union,” he elaborated. “As such, it’s simply economically unviable. As a result, it has been propped up by China for decades, but at this point after our recent decisions to act in Afghanistan and Syria, the regime in China is starting to reassess just how much it is in its national interest to maintain that client state in North Korea. That’s why this isn’t just the same-old, same-old news, Alex.”

Gorka said the usual national security debate lacks strategic sophistication. “That’s one of the reasons I came on board with Breitbart all those years ago, because the national security debate in D.C. and in general was just sophomoric. It was either you’ve got to be a neoconservative and invade other people’s countries, or you’ve got to be Ron Paul and you’ve got to be an isolationist,” he recalled.

“Well, the world’s a little bit more complicated that that,” he contended. “This president is not an interventionist, but he understands that without leadership, without America showing the way the system should work, then we have anarchy, and we have bad actors exploiting the vacuums created. Nothing’s changed about Donald J. Trump. He’s not different since before the election, as opposed to being the president. But the fact is, without leadership in the world, you have the chaos that we inherited after the last eight years.”

Marlow professed initial skepticism of the missile strike on Syria as the gateway to further intervention, but said that if it proved to be an isolated “one and done” action, it sent an important message to the world’s bad actors.

Gorka said both the Syria strike and the detonation of a huge MOAB munition in Afghanistan should be understood “not simply in terms of what we did physically on that day.”

“It’s not just about 59 cruise missiles, or that 21,000-pound bomb. It’s about the philosophy that statecraft, running the ship of state, can never be done purely based upon diplomacy and just words. If you’re not prepared to back it up with force – that doesn’t mean invading other people’s countries, but using force where necessary – then all it is, is just pieces of paper,” he said.

“The president understands that all the levers of national power must be used together, if we are to secure America and the interests of American citizens. It’s much more than about that event. It’s about understanding what it takes to be America again,” said Gorka.

Marlow cited Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s statement that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal, and asked if this was an indication the Trump administration would not scrap the deal, as Trump said before the election.

“No, I wouldn’t go that far,” Gorka replied. “Right now it means simply that there are certain aspects of the deal that are being held to, but the deal itself, and all U.S.-Iran policy, is being reviewed right now.”

“Don’t read too much into that, because everything is on the table in terms of reviewing the JCPOA,” he advised, referring to the nuclear deal by its formal acronym.

Responding to reports that the first illegal alien protected by President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has been deported, Gorka said it was a question of reinforcing the rule of law.

“We have incredibly clear language coming out of the Attorney General’s office himself, but listen to what General Kelly said as well: We have laws on the books. It is not un-American, it is not divisive to actually implement those laws and make them real. If somebody doesn’t like that, we have a republic, we have a democratic republic. Those laws need to be changed, if you can change them. But right now, they’re going to be implemented, and that applies to anybody who is an illegal alien.

Looking ahead to next month’s scheduled meeting between President Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Gorka expected them to discuss “all the obvious questions there are for common concerns to both countries,” including Syria, terrorism, and the Kurdish question.

“There are no simple answers to any of those, but remember: if you just look at the history of the 20th Century, Turkey is a geostrategically important nation,” he said. “Geography is destiny. Look at the size of the country, look at where it is. So that meeting is an important meeting.”

Finally, with respect to Tuesday’s murders in Fresno by a man who professed to hate white people and shouted “Allahu akbar!” when he was captured, Gorka said he looks at the fact that “since the caliphate was declared by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014, we have arrested more than 130 people linked to ISIS in America.”

“This is not a joke. There is no front line in this war. The front line is when you leave your house in the morning. Unfortunately, this threat has been allowed to expand. We are going to take it seriously, and we are going to knock it on the head,” he promised.

In today’s world of a Donald Trump presidency in which any actions he undertakes, regardless of its logical rational, becomes a topic of criticism by his political opponents, we must look at two of his decisions – independent of the tainted lenses through which critics choose to view them – made concerning Syria.

The first, following chemical weapons usage by President Bashar Assad’s regime against his own people, involved Tomahawk missile strikes against the airfield from which the aircraft laden with those weapons of mass destruction (WMD) operated.

Pundits like to claim that presidential candidate Trump declared in 2013 that we should not intervene in Syria and, therefore, his missile attack is hypocritical. Such pundits take an unrealistic view of a world arena in which a nation’s actions one day may not warrant a U.S. offensive response but, the next day, very well may. Assad’s chemical attack clearly fell into this category for several reasons: it was a war crime; it involved complicity by the Russians and President Barack Obama, who both knew such weapons remained in Syria’s inventory despite their assertions otherwise; and it demonstrated, by the attack’s brutality against his own people, of what Assad is capable.

Fortunately for his Middle East neighbors, Assad today is denied a nuclear option with which to threaten them. Pundits undoubtedly have forgotten that Iran and its nuclear and missile research R&amp;D puppet, North Korea, were collaborating on building a nuclear facility in Syria until 2007, when Israeli aircraft put an end to that effort by destroying it. A dictator fully capable of employing WMDs against his own people would not hesitate to use them against others.

The second decision we need examine is Trump’s announcement U.S. ground troops would not be sent into Syria. This, too, is logical, based not only on the realities of what such forces would face on the ground today in Syria, but also the realities of a war we earlier lost in Vietnam.

As one looks at the players involved in Syria today, it becomes apparent all is not black and white. While our main interests in Syria lie in stabilization and protecting its civilian population, the vast majority of whom are Sunni Muslim, we are hampered by Assad, of the minority Alawite Muslim sect, and his cronies in Tehran, who are Shiite Muslims. It was the large Sunni Syrian population that initially rose up against Assad due to his brutal reign, causing the dictator to put down those protests. While the U.S. initially saw its interests achieved only with the removal of Assad from power, American officials later said they would accept his leadership if elected.

This chemical attack against his people has more recently underscored the need to dethrone him. Today, we support “moderate” Muslim Sunni groups against Assad, which we may well find tomorrow are not so friendly.

It must be kept in mind our interests are directly opposed by Iran’s which, contrarily, lie in keeping Assad in power so as to continue with the expansion of the regional Shiite caliphate on which its mullahs remain focused. This caliphate, to date, has targeted once-Christian majority Lebanon, where Iran’s terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, is active; Shiite-majority Iraq, which only fought an eight-year war (1980-1988) with Tehran because its leader, Saddam Hussein, was Sunni; Libya, where various factions vie for full power; Yemen, where a once obscure rebel group known as Houthis, who are Shiites, rebelled against the government.

Obviously included in Iran’s caliphate equation is Syria. (Iran will eventually look to bring another Shiite majority state, Azerbaijan, into the caliphate fold but, right now, has its hands full in these other countries). Also noteworthy is that Iran and Russia are working together to undermine U.S. interests in Sunni-majority Afghanistan.

During the Vietnam war, while the U.S. poured ground forces into the country to stem the flow of Hanoi’s efforts to take control of the country, we were confronted with powers in that region having contrary interests that proved able to draw the conflict out, engaging us in what was then our longest war. Countries like China and Russia achieved this by providing Hanoi with an unlimited supply of equipment, vehicles, surface-to-air missile launchers, arms, ammunition, etc. Similarly, Iran today provides its proxy forces with these assets which, were there to be U.S. ground forces committed to Syria, would drastically increase.

The leader of the North Vietnamese Army, General Nguyen Giap, prided himself in conducting a war against America not involving major confrontations of massive armies but, rather, numerous limited smaller unit engagements the Chinese call “lingchi” or “death of a thousand cuts” to bleed America dry and into withdrawing. This would also be Iran’s modus operandi against U.S. ground forces. Interestingly, it has been aided in supplying its proxies today with war material by Obama’s administration which, as part of its nuclear deal with the mullahs, gave them billions of dollars in cash to continue their violent regional activities.

There is another factor distinguishing the Vietnam war from the turmoil in Syria if U.S. ground forces were to be involved. While China and Russia’s interests opposed America’s in Vietnam, U.S. ground forces never confronted the ground forces of any other nation state as Hanoi was fully committed to providing its own manpower to do so. In Syria, Iran already has its own ground forces actively involved, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, thus making a direct confrontation with our main adversary much more likely.

During the early 1960s, several military advisors informed Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson Vietnam was not the right place at the right time to confront communist aggression. However, if the U.S. were to get involved in Vietnam, it should go in “air heavy” and “ground light.” This advice is just as sound today for a 21st-century battlefield situated thousands of miles away from Vietnam where foreign-supported aggression has again reared its ugly head. With his announcement not to commit U.S. ground forces to Syria, President Trump has made the right decision at the right time.

Facebook, Inc. is encouraging its employees, and the workers at its outsourced labor contractors, to walk out on International Workers’ Day — May Day — and join unions, communists and Black Bloc enforcers in protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration restrictions.

According to Bloomberg, Facebook posted on its internal forum April 14 that all their workers have the right to walk out or just not show up on May 1. The company proclaimed that this is not a new policy.

But shortly thereafter, Facebook warned it will retaliate against any of its contractors for staff security guards, janitorial staff, bus drivers and other campus service providers if they fail to support the edict giving workers the day off.

A Facebook spokesperson told Mashable, “At Facebook, we’re committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions and speaking up.” He added, “We support our people in recognizing International Workers’ Day and other efforts to raise awareness for safe and equitable employment conditions.”

Silicon Valley May Day protests have grown over the last three, years as members of the International Longshoreman’s Union shut down the docks, and members of the Service Employees International Union shut down BART trains and city halls.

A Facebook app has been at the center of organizing a series of Silicon Valley social justice rallies and protests against President Trump, capitalism, climate change, racism, sexism and immigration law enforcement, which kicked off with the March 14 Pi Day, led by Dex Torricke-Barton, former speechwriter for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

May Day worker celebrations trace their roots back to Chicago’s Haymaker Square Riot, when the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions, which became the American Federation of Labor, proclaimed that “eight hours shall constitute a legal day’s labor from and after May 1, 1886” and led 350,000 U.S. workers on a nationwide walk-out.

According to the authoritative Marxist.org website, hand bills passed out that day stating:

“Workingmen to Arms!

War to the Palace, Peace to the Cottage, and Death to LUXURIOUS IDLENESS.

The wage system is the only cause of the World’s misery. It is supported by the rich classes, and to destroy it, they must be either made to work or DIE.

One pound of DYNAMITE is better than a bushel of BALLOTS!

MAKE YOUR DEMAND FOR EIGHT HOURS with weapons in your hands to meet the capitalistic bloodhounds, police, and militia in proper manner.”

On the fourth day of the protests, strikers tossed a bomb into a line of 180 policemen that were demanding the crowds disperse. With 7 policemen dead and 60 injured, the police opened fire and killed 4 protestors and injured 70 others.

The Chicago City Council on March 25, 1992, officially granted historic landmark status to the Haymarket Square as a significant event in American and world labor history.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b87487c52:2968f68:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Pakistani authorities have detained at least 22 individuals in connection to the lynching of a university student accused of committing an act of blasphemy against Islam.

Law enforcement has also arrested a 19-year-old woman accused of being recruited by the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) to carry out a suicide attack on a Christian church on Easter Sunday.

The arrests come soon after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration cited Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws in a message warning American citizens against traveling to the Muslim-majority nation.

In Pakistan, blasphemy laws primarily target Christians and other members of religious minority groups.

The Associated Press (AP) reports:

The 16 students and six university employees are believed to have incited or taken part in the mob that killed 23-year-old Mohammad Mashal Khan, provincial police chief Salahuddin Mehsud said. The student was beaten and shot to death at a university in the northwestern city of Mardan on Thursday. Mehsud said no evidence has been found to indicate Khan committed blasphemy against Islam, which is punishable by death in Pakistan.

Protests involving demonstrators calling for the execution of Christians and other people accused or merely suspected of committing acts of blasphemy are common in Pakistan.

Although Pakistan has reportedly not yet executed anyone for a blasphemy law conviction, various people have been sentenced to death and extremists have been known to take matters into their own hands, sometimes killing the accused.

Pakistan also made the arrests as Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, arrived in Islamabad to discuss ongoing efforts against jihadists in South Asia, stressing that Islamabad has been “selectively” targeting terrorist groups.

The Pentagon has long reported that Pakistan serves as a sanctuary for terrorist groups fighting against U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

Jihadists from al-Qaeda, the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), and the Taliban maintain strongholds along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and are known to operate in both countries, moving freely across the international boundary.

AP learned from a Pakistani military spokesman that authorities recently arrested 19-year-old Noreen Leghari. ISIS terrorists recruited her this month to attack a church, revealed Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, adding that law enforcement took her into custody after a shootout on April 14.

Last week, the Trump administration dropped the “mother of all bombs” on a network of caves and tunnels in the ISIS stronghold located in eastern Afghanistan’s opium-rich Nangarhar province on the country’s border with Pakistan.

The U.S. military dropped the Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, or MOAB, on Thursday, killing nearly 100 ISIS jihadists.

Pakistan has long attempted to downplay the presence of ISIS on its soil, points out AP.

“Monday’s announcement marked the first time Pakistani officials have acknowledged that the extremist group based in Syria and Iraq is recruiting within the South Asian country,” it adds.

In January 2015, ISIS officially announced its presence in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, home to the largest concentration of terrorist groups in the world, according to the U.S.-NATO coalition.

The majority of ISIS fighters are believed to be Pakistani Pashtuns, former members of the country’s Taliban branch.

According to the U.S. military, the local ISIS branch has been dramatically degraded, from a peak of 3,000 fighters to about 700 fighters now.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b87487c52:2968f61:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Comedian and Family Feud host Steve Harvey says President Donald Trump has been making good on his promises to help restore America’s underprivileged communities.

Harvey met with Trump at Trump Tower after the election, where the two men discussed plans to partner with the president’s Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson on an affording housing initiative.

“As for as doing what he promised me he would do, he is doing it,” Harvey told TMZ. “I’m working with HUD. I’m going to get some housing for underprivileged people. We’re going to set up some centers around the country. I’ve met with HUD. It’s going really well. God willing, it will work out.”

“He’s keeping his word to what he said he would do,” Harvey added when asked if he was happy with the job Trump has done so far.

The Think Like a Man producer faced heavy criticism over his decision to work with the Trump White House.

CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill called Harvey a “mediocre negro” who was seeking attention, while rapper and reality TV star T.I. said Harvey should “know way better than” to meet with Trump.

Harvey defended his decision to work with Trump, saying “Change can only happen when we sit at the table. If we sit at the table, then we can have a say as to what’s to be eaten on the menu. I have an obligation to take a seat at the table when invited.”

On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox &amp; Friends,” Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said that on foreign policy “I am like the happiest dude in America right now. We’ve got a president and a national security team that I have been dreaming of…he’s done more to correct the world — President Trump — than Obama did in 8 years. … I am all in. Keep it up, Donald.”

Graham began by saying, “I think we dodged a bullet with healthcare. I’m not so sure the House bill would have done much better fixing Obamacare. It was probably Obamacare-lite, some people say. I would let it collapse because it will. It’s so poorly designed. I would tell the Democrats, you created this mess, let me help you fix it.” And “When it comes to taxes, we better cut your taxes, or we’ll pay a price in 2018. If you can’t get all Republicans on board for a tax idea, then we’re going to have to maybe marry it up with infrastructure.”

When the discussion turned to foreign policy, Graham stated, “I am like the happiest dude in America right now. We’ve got a president and a national security team that I have been dreaming of for 8 years. So, in 80 days he’s done more to correct the world — President Trump — than Obama did in 8 years. We sent a letter to our good buddy the Ayatollah, hey, knock it off. … North Korea, if I were Kim Jong-un, whatever his name is, I would listen to Mike Pence. The fact that the vice president of the United States went to the DMZ, looked across the way, and said, we’re watching you. Donald Trump is not going to let this nutjob in North Korea get a missile to hit America, and if I were North Korea and China, I’d start thinking anew about the president of the United States.”

He added, “I am really pleased what he’s done to rebuild our military, to restore our standing. I want to cut taxes and reform healthcare. He’s got the best national security team I’ve seen since I’ve been in government. I am all in. Keep it up, Donald.”

The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) and its rival al-Qaeda are considering joining forces as U.S.-backed local troops get closer to pushing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s group out if its last major stronghold in Iraq, Mosul, said the Iraqi vice president.

Citing unnamed regional sources, Vice President Ayad Allawi said in an interview Monday, “The discussion has started now. There are discussions and dialogue between messengers representing [ISIS leader] Baghdadi and representing [al-Qaeda chief Ayman al] Zawahiri,” reports Reuters.

The Iraqi vice president did note that it remains unclear how exactly the two group would collaborate.

“I can’t see ISIS disappearing into thin air,” he added. “They will remain covertly in sleeping cells, spreading their venom all over the world.”

ISIS broke away from al-Qaeda in 2014. The al-Qaeda leader has blasted ISIS for its brutality, which often involves decapitations, drownings, burnings, and immolation, among other atrocities.

Until recent months, the two groups have been fiercely fighting one another for influence, territory, and recruits.

The deadly battles between the two groups have seemingly subsided, likely given ISIS’ preoccupation with the U.S.-backed offensive in Iraq, where an Iraqi general recently said the group controls less than seven percent of the territory.

This year, both groups released propaganda videos threatening China. Both Baghdadi and Zawahiri have labeled China an enemy.

Nevertheless, ISIS video also takes aim at the al-Qaeda affiliate that threatened China, the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP).

In recent years, al-Qaeda has capitalized on the U.S.-led coalition’s nearly single-minded focus to annihilate ISIS.

However, the group is facing mounting pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, particularly its most dangerous branch, the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

The U.S. military and some Afghan officials have said that ISIS has worked together with its rival in Afghanistan, the Taliban, an al-Qaeda ally.

Echoing FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly warned that ISIS foreign fighters might seek to attack the United States once they return to their homeland following the collapse of the terrorist group in the Middle East.

During a discussion about threats facing the United States, Kelly said:

And as the coalition we lead wins against what are best described as conventional-terrorist formations in the [ISIS] caliphate [in Iraq and Syria], the expectation is that many of these ‘holy warriors’ will survive departing for their home countries to wreak murderous havoc in Europe, Asia, the Maghreb, the Caribbean and the United States. And because many are citizens of countries in our Visa Waiver Program [VWP], they can more easily travel to the United States which makes us a prime target for their exported violence.

The Visa Waiver Program allows citizens of 38 countries, the majority of them in Europe, to travel to the U.S. without a visa for stays of up to 90 days.

In March, FBI Comey warned, “At some point, there is going to be a terrorist diaspora out of Syria like we’ve never seen before. Not all of the Islamic State killers are going to die on the battlefield.”

“Through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of really dangerous people and they are going to flow primarily to Western Europe” but also to the United States,” he added.

The battle for Mosul has been raging since last October.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b871a9ee2:2874bbd:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump lost California by a wide margin in November. Yet the state was crucial to his surprise victory overall — thanks to the large number of Californians on his team, and to the specific issues he highlighted on the trail.

A new profile by Scott Lucas of Politico, “How California Gave Us Trumpism,” highlights these factors — as well as the unique role played by Breitbart California in coverage of the shocking murder of Kate Steinle on July 1, 2015:

The signal California moment for the marriage of Claremont constitutionalism and Breitbart spectacle came in July 2015, not long after Trump had launched his presidential campaign. On that day, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who had been deported five times, allegedly fired three shots from a handgun while walking along the waterfront in San Francisco. One of those bullets ricocheted off the pavement and struck a 32-year-old passerby named Kathryn Steinle in the back. She died two hours later in a nearby hospital. Breitbart feasted on the story, which it depicted as the ultimate proof of California’s decline and, more broadly, the grievous consequences of unconstitutional immigration run amok. San Francisco’s city leaders were criticized for prioritizing sanctuary city policies in a play for Latino votes, rather than carrying out their basic public safety functions. Mass immigration, the erosion of constitutional norms and weak-spined liberal politicians all played a role in Steinle’s death, Breitbart argued. From “Unchecked Immigration: A Greater Threat to The USA Than ISIS” and “SF Supervisors Refuse to Answer Questions About Steinle’s Death,” the site published more than 100 news and opinion articles about Steinle’s death. On the campaign trail, Trump quickly held up the incident as the epitome of a broken immigration system. “My heartfelt condolences to the family of Kathryn Steinle. Very, very sad!” the candidate tweeted days after the killing, adding “We need a wall!” Less than a week later, Breitbart News reported that Trump had surged in a poll of its readers, climbing to second place in the GOP primary field, behind Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. “Trump’s message about illegal immigration may resonate even more” after the shooting, the site reported, presciently.

Lucas correctly identifies the Kate Steinle moment as a turning point in the campaign. As Breitbart News explained in September 2016, it was Trump’s effort to highlight the plight of the victims of crimes by illegal aliens that shifted the entire Republican primary race. As “Blue State Blues: The Graph That Explains Donald Trump’s Surge” recounted:

On July 10, 2015, former Florida governor Jeb Bush was the frontrunner, at 16.3%. Donald Trump was a distant seventh, with just 6.5% of the vote. Keep in mind that Trump had been running against illegal immigration since he launched his campaign more than three weeks before, with his infamous remarks about illegal aliens from Mexico. None of that had resonated much. And then, on July 1, 32-year-old Kate Steinle was shot and killed in San Francisco while strolling along a pier with her father. The murderer, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, had been deported five times before, and had been convicted of seven felonies. He later told a local journalist that he had specifically come to San Francisco because it was a “sanctuary city” that would not cooperate with federal immigration officials or enforce immigration laws. Breitbart News focused on that story in the days that followed. Breitbart California’s Michelle Moons, who had covered the protests in Murietta against re-settling illegal alien children who had surged across the Mexican border exactly a year before, wrote a series of articles about Steinle. She used her extensive sources in the law enforcement community, as well as among families who had lost loved ones to crimes by illegal aliens, to build the details of the story and place it in a broader context. That was when Trump began to show an interest in meeting with those families, who had reached out to him in the days after the Steinle murder. He met with them on July 10 in Los Angeles, and the enduring image of that event was of the ever-voluble Donald Trump standing silently as he listened to the families pouring out their grief. … From that moment, Trump took off in the polls, and almost never looked back. From seventh place in the RealClearPolitics average on July 10, Trump shot to first by July 19. His dramatic rise is all the more surprising given that only 7 percent of Americans called immigration the “most important problem” facing the country in a Gallup poll taken over the same period. By listening to the families, and giving them a voice, Trump was no longer speaking of illegal immigration in the abstract, but in a concrete, human way. In so doing, he connected with others who had been victimized, or ignored, by their own government on so many issues, from trade to Obamacare.

That September 2016 article concluded: “The question now is whether Trump can convince enough voters by November 8 to trust him, as the victims’ families do.”

Of course, we now know the answer.

Former British ambassador to North Korea John Everard writes at CNN.com on Wednesday that President Donald Trump’s assertive strategy towards the rogue nuclear power may have actually worked, despite domestic criticism.

Everard writes:

In my opinion, the most plausible explanation for this is that North Korea blinked. Although it is possible the extensive preparations around its nuclear test site were intended only to wind up the international community, it seems more likely that the North Koreans did indeed plan a nuclear test Saturday but desisted, probably because they assessed the risks of serious retaliation were too great. The US carrier group it thought was near Korea and China’s threat on April 12 to support UN sanctions, including cutting off North Korea’s oil supply — which would have quickly brought its fragile economy to a halt — probably weighed heavily on Pyongyang as well.

Though domestic critics attacked Trump for stating that the USS Carl Vinson and an “armada” were sailing toward the Korean peninsula, when in fact the ships were far away, Everard says that Trump’s statement was a successful bluff.

The North Korean dictator thought the carrier group really was off the Korean coast, Everard writes. “Very few people outside the US administration knew the carrier group was in fact some 3,500 miles away from the Korean Peninsula.”

He concludes:

Perhaps the North Koreans calculated (rightly, it seems) that either a nuclear test or a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile — a long-range missile of the kind they would need to carry a nuclear warhead to the continental United States — was too dangerous. Instead, launching a medium-range missile would allow them to deny they were buckling under foreign pressure while not triggering a vigorous international reaction. The fact it failed doubtless also softened responses. If this analysis is right, then the United States has, for now at least, succeeded in its long-term goal of halting the development of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles.

One observer who predicted Trump’s success in the confrontation was Dilbert illustrator and author Scott Adams, who had been stating for weeks that Trump’s unpredictable military moves might scare China into reining in its client state.

CNN is rarely positive in its coverage of the 45th president, making Everard’s article particularly noteworthy.

After suffering over a year of attacks due to his support of President Donald Trump, Super Bowl champion New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is now bowing out of the team visit to the White House, citing family matters as the reason.

The five-time Super Bowl winner posted a message to social media saying that while he is “excited” for the team’s visit to the White House, he will be skipping the event.

“I am so happy and excited that our team is being honored at the White House today,” Brady wrote in his statement.

“Our team has accomplished something very special that we are all proud of and will be for years to come,” Brady continued. “Thank you to the President for hosting this honorary celebration and for supporting our team for as long as I can remember.”

“In light of some recent developments, I am unable to attend today’s ceremony, as I am attending to some personal family matters,” Brady explained.

“Hopefully, if we accomplish the goal of winning a championship in the future years, we will [be] back on the South Lawn again soon. Have a great day,” he concluded.

Tom Brady is not attending White House ceremony today due to &quot;personal family matters.&quot; His statement: pic.twitter.com/OIidVZX3VV — Mike Reiss (@MikeReiss) April 19, 2017

The sudden announcement comes as a shock to many who expected Brady to be one of the first in line during the White House visit. Throughout the past NFL season, Brady was dogged by sports reporters more interested in social justice than sports who demanded he distance himself from Donald Trump — though he refused to do so.

The U.S. Department of State announced on Wednesday that President Donald Trump has ordered an NSC-led review of the nuclear agreement with Iran brokered in 2015.

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, known more commonly as “the Iran deal,” was the result of negotiations between former President Barack Obama, members of the United Nation’s Security Council, Germany, and the EU. The NSC-led review will investigate whether lifting sanctions against the world’s top sponsor of terror may not be in the U.S. national interest.

“Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror, through many platforms and methods,” Tillerson said in a statement issued on Wednesday. “President Donald J. Trump has directed a National Security Council-led interagency review of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that will evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States.”

The State Department announcement states that the agency is certifying the action through a letter to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.

This letter certifies that the conditions of Section 135(d)(6) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended, including as amended by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-17), enacted May 22, 2015, are met as of April 18, 2017. Notwithstanding, Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror through many platforms and methods. President Donald J. Trump has directed a National Security Council-led interagency review of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that will evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States. When the interagency review is completed, the administration looks forward to working with Congress on this issue.

On March 29, Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), told Congress that the U.S. needs to have military action as an option on the table given Iran’s continuing belligerence and support for terrorist groups in the Middle East and beyond.

“Iran poses the most significant threat to the Central Region and to our national interests and the interests of our partners and allies,” Votel said in his prepared testimony.

“We have not seen any improvement in Iran’s behavior since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), addressing Iran’s nuclear program, was finalized in July 2015,” Votel said.

Votel said that, since the agreement was finalized, the U.S. military has seen a heightened number of “malign activities” on the part of Iran and its proxies in the Central Region, including “Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Egypt, the Sinai, and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait [located between Yemen and Djibouti and Eritrea] and in other parts of our area of responsibility.”

The Central Region, or CENTCOM AOR, covers more than 4 million square miles that includes 20 predominantly Muslim nations stretching from Northeast Africa across the Middle East to Central and South Asia.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b8713cdd4:2863e9d:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

While President Donald Trump amasses praise from labor unions and pro-American work advocates for his cracking down on abuse within the H-1B visa program, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is distressed by the executive order.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce slammed Trump’s order, which mandates that the Departments of Justice, Labor, and Homeland Security conduct legal reviews of the H-1B system and its impacts on American labor.

“Economic growth requires a skilled workforce, so it should be a priority to make sure American workers have the skills required to fill open jobs with American companies,” the Chamber wrote in a statement. “It would be a mistake to close the door on high-skilled workers from around the world who can contribute to American businesses’ growth and expansion and make the U.S. more competitive around the world. The H-1B program plays an important role in addressing this need, but it can be improved.”

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s statement also claims the organization supports Trump’s ‘Buy American’ initiative, but said “expanding current ‘Buy American’ rules in U.S. law would make it more difficult to spur growth and jobs here at home.”

Rather than reforming or ending the H-1B visa program, which gives at least 85,000 U.S.-based jobs to foreign workers every year, the Chamber said they would prefer an expansion.

“If the goal is to grow the economy and create jobs, which the administration has indicated, it’s important to open more procurement markets for American companies and attract the best and brightest talent,” the statement read. “We look forward to working with the administration to accomplish those shared goals.”

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce touts their support for “a legal status” for illegal immigrants on their website, despite the harmful impacts it would have on American workers. As Breitbart News has reported, there are perhaps 1.8 million foreign guest workers in the U.S. despite 4 million young Americans entering the workforce every year.

If the H-1B visa program had never been introduced and enacted, computer science job availability in the labor market would be up 11 percent and wages in the tech industry would have increased by five percent, Breitbart News reported.

With American voters, the H-1B visa remains incredibly unpopular, since only 30 percent of Americans said in a recent poll that the H-1B visa is necessary, Breitbart Texas reported.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stressed the importance of peaceful diplomacy to resolve the North Korean crisis on Monday, but he added that mere dialogue would be “meaningless.”

“Needless to say, it’s important to maintain peace through diplomatic efforts. At the same time, dialogue for the sake of dialogue would be meaningless. We need to put pressure on North Korea so that it will seriously respond to calls for dialogue,” Abe told his parliament, as reported by Japan Times.

There is a rather fine line between meaningful and “meaningless” dialogue. Abe seems to be looking for a way to gently but firmly demand real actions from North Korea to back up their words, rather than the diplomatic merry-go-round the world has been riding with Pyongyang since the 1990s. He is suggesting North Korea must take a few concrete steps before all parties resume cordial conversations around the negotiating table.

The Prime Minister rather ominously used part of his appearance before the Diet committee to discuss the steps Japan should take to prepare for an influx of refugees from the Korean Peninsula in the event of a conflict, and stressed his government’s responsibility for “protecting and rescuing Japanese citizens if they face crises overseas.” There are about 60,000 Japanese citizens on the Korean peninsula.

The Associated Press reports that last Friday, Abe’s National Security Council met to discuss the possibility that a wave of refugees from North Korea could include armed soldiers hiding among the refugees, seeking to enter Japan so they could carry out terrorist attacks.

Another difficult point raised by the Associated Press is that Japan’s government is drawing up plans to pre-position planes and ships in South Korea to assist with the evacuation of Japanese nationals in the event of hostilities, but the South Koreans may be uncomfortable with the presence of massed Japanese transports at their airfields and ports, due to long memories of World War II.

On Tuesday, Abe had a working lunch with visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who said President Donald Trump is “determined to work closely with Japan, with South Korea, with all our allies in the region, and with China, to achieve a peaceable solution and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”

A Japanese official told Kyodo News that Pence told Abe the U.S. believes “China fully understands the issue and will take action that will lead to further pressure on North Korea.”

After the lunch, Pence held a press conference with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso in which he declared “to all the people of Japan, in these challenging times, we are with you 100 percent.”

Pence also repeated the Trump administration’s point that North Korea is “the most ominous threat” in the region, and “the era of strategic patience is over.” He reportedly endorsed Abe’s statement that “dialogue for dialogue’s sake is meaningless.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b86eca8e6:257f544:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

CAIRO (AP) — The lawyer of Egyptian-American charity worker Aya Hijazi says she has been released from prison after nearly three years of detention.

Taher Abol Nasr told The Associated Press she was released late Tuesday, two days after a court acquitted her of charges of child abuse that were widely dismissed as bogus by human rights groups and U.S. officials.

Hijazi and her husband had established a foundation to aid street children, but were arrested along with six others in 2014. It was not immediately clear whether her co-defendants were also released.

U.S. President Donald Trump did not publicly mention the case when he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi earlier this month, but a senior White House official had said ahead of the meeting that the case would be addressed.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b863d5cc2:244d5a1:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

U.S. Customs and Border Protection sent a self-identified illegal alien with criminal convictions back to a family member’s home in Mexico on Tuesday, according to media reports.

USA Today reports that Juan Manuel Montes, 23, is the first illegal alien who applied for temporary protection from lawful deportation to be sent back home after President Donald Trump assumed office. Montes first arrived in the U.S. at nine years old, and applied for a deportation stay under Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), twice.

“Court records show he has four convictions: one for shoplifting in January 2016, and three for driving without a license, most recently three months ago,” the outlet reports.

An agent approached Montes in Calexico, California, on Feb. 17, and he allegedly had no identification or proof of “DACA status” with him. According to USA Today, Montes had carelessly left those documents in someone else’s car. Three hours later, he was reportedly back in Mexico at an aunt and uncle’s home in western Mexico.

Illegal alien Montes expressed surprise that the laws against illegal aliens would ever be enforced.

“Some people told me that they were going to deport me; others said nothing would happen. I thought that if I kept my nose clean nothing would happen,” he said.

An attorney with the National Immigration Law Center also complained about routine law enforcement. “Even in this administration, because of Trump’s comments about loving these people, the integrity of the government’s promises are at stake. How does an immigrant family today know that this is not going to happen to them?” Marielena Hincapié told USA Today. The paper did not correct her abuse of the term “immigrant,” which refers to alien individuals given a permanent right to reside in the U.S. and work without restrictions—not foreign criminals squatting on U.S. territory.

The roughly 1.4 million illegal aliens who eagerly signed up for amnesty under Obama handed over their identities, addresses, and free admission of committing a crime. One million of the illegal aliens who got temporary amnesty are from Mexico. Over half live in California or Texas.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b84bd799b:242fee8:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

It may not be illegal to use the prestige of government service to positively impact one’s private sector business pursuits, “but criminal conflict of interest law prohibits federal officials, like Trump and her husband [Jared Kushner], from participating in government matters that could impact their own financial interest or that of their spouse,” the Associated Press reported on Tuesday.

Earlier this month Ivanka Trump Marks LLC won provisional approval from the Chinese government for three trademarks for her line of jewelry, handbags, and spa services — which protects her brand by giving the company exclusive rights to sell it in that country.

AP reported, without providing sources or links, that the trademarks were approved on the same night that Trump and Ivanka’s husband dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, Fla. home, adding that they ate “steak and Dover sole.”

“The scenario underscores how difficult it is for Trump, who has tried to distance herself from the brand that bears her name, to separate business from politics in her new position at the White House,” AP reported.

The AP story does include some facts that disclose what the first daughter, who is serving as an adviser to her father, has done to take steps to address even the “appearance” of ethical concerns or conflict of interest, including a statement from Trump’s attorney.

“Ivanka will not weigh in on business strategy, marketing issues, or the commercial terms of agreements,” Jamie Gorelick said in a statement. “She has retained authority to direct the trustees to terminate agreements that she determines create a conflict of interest or the appearance of one.”

“China, however, remains a nagging concern,” AP reported.

“Ivanka has so many China ties and conflicts, yet she and Jared appear deeply involved in China contacts and policy,” Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama said in the AP report.

“I would never have allowed it. For their own sake, and the country’s, Ivanka and Jared should consider stepping away from China matters,” Eisen said.

AP reported that Ivanka’s fashion business ventures are doing exceedingly well:

The number of Ivanka Trump items sold through [the fashion website] Lyst was 46 percent higher the month her father was elected president than in November 2015. Sales spiked 771 percent in February over the same month last year. In March sales on Lyst were up 262 percent over the same period last year.

Net sales for Trump’s G-III Apparel Group Ltd. clothing line increased by $17.9 million during the year that ended Jan. 31.

“Her brand is flourishing, despite boycotts and several stores limiting her merchandise,” AP reported, noting that U.S. imports, almost all from China, rose some 166 percent last year with sales hitting record levels in 2017.

AP noted that during the summit with Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping, Ivanka Trump’s 5-year-old daughter Arabella sang a Chinese song in Mandarin. The video of the performance was viewed over 2.2 million times on Chinese state media.

In February, after remarks in support of Trump’s fashion and beauty line were made by President Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, Nordstrom announced it would no longer sell the brand.

A Breitbart News exclusive revealed that the move by the retailer backfired:

Retail department store Nordstrom’s decision last week to cut first daughter Ivanka Trump’s fashion line has sparked a tremendous backlash from consumers—especially women—who say the company’s move has led them to boycott the store and cut up their Nordstrom’s cards. Nordstrom’s claimed that the Ivanka Trump brand wasn’t performing well, but industry insiders tell Breitbart News that’s just not accurate. Nordstrom’s decision to mislead the public on why they are stopping carrying the Ivanka Trump brand is part of the fury out there among its longtime customers, who tell Breitbart News they’re cutting up their Nordstrom’s cards and won’t shop at the store anymore. Some even say they plan to return all their recent purchases.

Aside from trademarks in China, Ivanka Trump’s brand also has obtained or applied for them in numerous countries, including Canada, India, Japan, Israel, Mexico, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., and Europe, AP reported.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b84bd799b:242fee7:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” while discussing President Donald Trump’s tweets about Tuesday’s special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, co-host Joy Behar said Trump uses his “limited” vocabulary and “thinking” to appeal to people “who are afraid of things.”

Behar said, “Trump, what he does, he’s so limited in his vocabulary and his thinking. It’s like, he’ll tweet, ‘They make you less safe’ —fearmongering, ‘More immigrants are coming in’ — fearmongering, ‘They’re going to raise your taxes’ — it’s all fearmongering. And he appeals to people who are afraid of things and that’s what he does. People need to wake up.”

It was a photo finish in the “jungle primary” special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District on Tuesday to select a replacement for Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), punctuated by unusual technical reporting delays from Fulton County, the largest county in the district.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, thirty-year-old Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff fell just short of the 50-percent-plus-one vote total he needed to avoid a June runoff with the GOP’s Karen Handel, the former Georgia Secretary of State who finished in a distant second.

CNN declared the race a runoff between Ossoff and Handel shortly after midnight.

At 12:09 a.m. President Trump tweeted, “Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, Big “R” win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!”

With 177 of 210 precincts reporting as of 12:25 a.m. eastern on Wednesday morning, the Associated Press results had Ossoff in first place with 49 percent of the vote, followed by the GOP’s Karen Handel in second at 19 percent, and the GOP’s Bob Gray in third place and out of the runoff election with 10 percent.

Ossoff did very well in early voting, garnering 61 percent of those ballots from Cobb, DeKalb, and Fulton County. Strong early voting results are usually an indication of organization and preparation on the part of the campaign.

However, as the evening wore on, Ossoff’s margin continued to diminish.

By 11:00 p.m. eastern, with 113 of 210 precincts reporting, Ossoff had 50.3 percent of the vote. Handel was in a distant second with 18 percent. All precincts in Cobb and DeKalb County had reported by then, but only 19 of the 116 precincts in Fulton County had reported.

The evening was set up for a dramatic finish, since only a few months earlier Hillary Clinton had won the precincts in Fulton County within the Sixth Congressional District with 48 percent of the vote.

At 11:05 p.m., Decision Desk HQ broke the news on Twitter that Fulton County was experiencing technical difficulties reporting the vote results.

From our onsite reporter: Fulton County is having technical difficulties. They are on the phone with tech support. I’m not joking. — Drew McCoy (@_Drew_McCoy_) April 19, 2017

Then at 11:35 p.m., Decision Desk HQ added this tweet:

One card out of hundreds created an error. They need to manually go through them and re-upload everything in #Fulton #GA06 — Decision Desk HQ (@DecisionDeskHQ) April 19, 2017

Then at 11:40 p.m. came this tweet:

Again, we all get it, #GA06 almost certainly going to a runoff between Ossoff and Handel. With Fulton screwed up, waiting until they… — Decision Desk HQ (@DecisionDeskHQ) April 19, 2017

Finally, at 11:50 p.m. came this:

THEY FOUND THE CARD WITH THE ERROR #Fulton #GA06 — Decision Desk HQ (@DecisionDeskHQ) April 19, 2017

By 11:55 p.m. with 177 of 210 precincts reporting, Ossoff’s vote dipped below a majority to 49 percent, with the GOP’s Handel moving up slightly to a 19 percent second place position.

At 12:01 a.m., Decision Desk HQ called the election a runoff between Ossoff and Handel, a full 20 minutes before CNN made the call:

33 precincts left in Fulton but over for Ossoff clearing 50% tonight remainder will probably push him down to 46-47% https://t.co/C0HrRw3rO1 — Decision Desk HQ (@DecisionDeskHQ) April 19, 2017

The progressive establishment around the country had hoped to secure an outright victory for Ossoff in this suburban Atlanta Congressional District that President Trump won by only one percent in November.

The hope among progressive activists and the liberal media was that an Ossoff victory in this district would be an early indicator of an impending anti-Trump wave that could turn the House of Representatives back to Democratic control in the 2018 midterm elections.

The far left political machine raised huge amounts of money from liberal strong points around the country — in New York, San Francisco, and Hollywood — to bankroll Ossoff’s campaign with more than $8.3 million raised in the first three months of his campaign.

Ossoff used these funds to flood the airwaves on television and radio with anti-Trump messages and raise an estimated army of 3,500 get-out-the-vote canvassers whom the campaign claimed knocked on over 100,000 doors.

Ossoff was aided by the fact that the Democratic establishment rallied around him and not the four other Democrats in the crowded field of 18 candidates.

Republican resources were split between eleven Republican contenders. The most prolific fundraising candidate among them raised less than $500,000, — not even ten percent of the amount Ossoff raised.

The Republican establishment, initially caught flat-footed, ended up spending over $5 million in advertising against Ossoff in the last weeks of the campaign, but it never caught up in the all-important ground game, which typically consists of a positive voter engagement on behalf of a single specific candidate rather than a negative attack on a single candidate.

In retrospect, Republicans failed to recognize the unique opportunity the “jungle primary” provided Democrats who focused all their support behind one candidate. Republican leadership could have made a similar choice from among their eleven candidates, but did not do so. They did, in the end, get some help from the Republican establishment in Washington.

“Republicans in Georgia sounded the alarm several weeks ago, prompting $2 million in spending from the NRCC to help boost Republican turnout and counter Democrats’ energy. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with House leadership, also dumped in $3 million of its own money and dispatched on-the-ground staffers to the district,” Politico reported.

Speaker Ryan, however, who has the responsibility to support Republican candidates in the House, did not see the risk of a Democratic victory in Georgia until it was too late.

In fact, he was not even in the United States on Tuesday. Instead, he was in Europe, leading a bi-partisan Congressional delegation.

Shortly after midnight, Ryan’s office issued this statement:</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b84aa1538:2415919:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The establishment media is hiding the dramatic news that President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has announced a national campaign to eradicate the imported practice of Female Genital Mutilation.

By ignoring the imported FGM practice, the TV networks “are guilty of aiding and abetting violence against women out of a politically correct fueled fear of offending Muslims,” says an April 18 statement by the Media Research Center and ACT for America.

The federal government’s dramatic policy announcement was made April 13 when officials revealed they had charged a Muslim doctor for performing FGM on two American girls from Minnesota. The doctor and the two girls have immigrant parents from Muslim countries, where Islamic leaders endorse the peculiar institution to keep women subordinate to men. Officials also said they had found additional child victims in Michigan.

The establishment media has largely hidden the administration’s new pro-female policy and the shocking crime, which threatens or has already victimized more than 500,000 young American women whose parents are immigrants from countries where FGM is routine.

On April 13, the New York Times just posted a 637-word article on page A14 about a “Michigan doctor” without mentioning “Islam” or “Muslim.” The Washington Post merely ran a 760-word online article on April 13 about a “Detroit emergency room doctor,” and a four-paragraph AP report in the newspaper about a “Detroit-area doctor” on April 14. Neither article mentioned Islam.

TheHill ran a 221-word piece on April 13 about a “Detroit emergency room doctor” which hid the role of imported Islamic ideas. Politico’s website shows no mention of the Muslim doctor’s s name.

The Virginia-based Media Research Council slammed the TV networks on April 18 for ignoring the issue. “Since last Thursday, The New York Times, FoxNews.com, and CNN.com have all posted pieces online about the case and Fox News’ Tucker Carlson ran a segment about it on his show Friday. So far, the morning and evening news shows at the big three networks have been silent, and as of this morning so has CNN,” MRC reported Tuesday, April 18.

“The media’s moral compass is hopelessly broken,” said an April 18 joint statement from MRC President Brent Bozell and Brigitte Gabriel, founder of ACT for America, an anti-terror groups with a reported membership of 500,000 members.

We have the first case of the brutal practice of FGM in the United States, and the networks are AWOL. You would think an extremely brutal practice of violence against women would make TV headlines here at home, but you would be wrong. Where is the outrage? The hypocrisy is staggering. The networks, which have for years championed the causes of left-wing feminists and women’s rights, are conspicuously silent on this case and their silence is deafening. This is real exploitation of young girls and the usual suspects who ought to care have little to say about this form of torture making its way to America. This practice is illegal and immoral. The networks have an ethical responsibility to report that it’s happening here at home. If they don’t, they are guilty of aiding and abetting violence against women out of a politically correct fueled fear of offending Muslims.

The progressives’ reluctance to name-and-shame Islam — despite copious evidence that Islam endorses and promotes the practice — comes as progressives try to block President Trump’s new immigration policies, which threaten to reduce the immigration of Islamic communities and political groups into the United States.

Also, progressive politicians and activists prefer to cooperate with Islamic governments overseas and with Islamic leaders domestically, instead of challenging Muslim government and communities to discard practices that violate Western-style rights. That preference is described at the website for Equality Now, which the New York Times describe as “an international women’s rights advocacy organization.” According to the group’s website:

Our formula for legal success is focusing on individual cases that are significant to a larger cause. Whether it is petitioning freedom for an Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning or drawing awareness to the destruction of girls’ schools in Pakistan, Equality Now is on the forefront of the gender equality evolution.

Amid the news about the U.S. case, the group tried to reframe the imported Islamic practice as generic, non-political “child-abuse.” The group’s leader, Shelby Quast, declared that “we know that this is a child abuse issue, and we know that we need to start training our child protection folks better,” according to the New York Times.

“We need better information about exactly where they are,” Quast said about the doctors that perform back-room FGMs, without noting that they are found in Islamic communities around the United States. For example, the Detroit doctor, Jumana Nagarwala, was trained at Johns Hopkins but reportedly is the daughter of two Indian immigrants from the Bohra sect of Shia Muslims. An article in the Hindustan Times reported that the female clitoris is described as “‘’haraam ki boti’ or immoral lump of flesh” by advocates of FGM.

The newspaper said the two victims were from Minnesota and were delivered to the doctor by their immigrant Somali mothers. Various reports say that Somali Muslims practice an extreme form of this FGM practice, while most Muslim practitioners perform a milder version, with some Muslims merely cutting the female genital “hood” without damaging the clitoris.

Quast declined to provide comments to Breitbart News.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b84aa1538:2415918:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Donald Trump is turning into David Cameron – and I don’t mean this as a compliment.

David Cameron had some pretty stiff competition in the field of Most Awful British Prime Minister of the Last 20 Years. But at least his rivals – the dour, incompetent Socialist Gordon Brown and the venal and slippery warmonger Tony Blair – campaigned on a Labour party ticket. Cameron, on the other hand, campaigned as a Conservative. And there’s really nothing more despicable than a politician who betrays his own voter base in order to position himself as a mainstream centrist.

This is what David Cameron did, throughout his two terms as Prime Minister. To anyone of a genuinely conservative disposition he was a massive disappointment: on his watch, the police and justice system grew more politically correct, the minimum wage rose, Keynesian deficit spending continued to flourish, green policies proliferated, defence spending was cut while foreign aid was increased – delighting the kind of people who believe that conservatism is heartless and evil, but infuriating those who understand that it’s about hard but fair decisions taken for the long term benefit of all.

Cameron’s fundamental problem was that he wasn’t ideological. He believed – like Bismarck, like Tony Blair, unlike Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan – that politics is the art of the possible. He wanted to be liked much more than he wanted to do the right thing. He was more interested in what his hero Tony Blair called “eye-catching initiatives” – ie meaningless gestures like his doomed schemes to create a “Big Society” and to lead “the Greenest Government Ever” – than doing hard stuff that needed to be done like reducing government spending or reforming the National Health Service.

Clearly, it is far too early to say whether Donald Trump will prove as big a letdown as David Cameron. But there are a few similarities which should worry us: those of us, at least, who had hoped – and still hope – he was going to be a radical president who would drain the swamp and act in the interests of his people rather than merely pander to the establishment elite.

One is his cronyism. With Cameron, this mainly took the form of filling his inner circle with people who’d shared his privileged education at Eton or at least were rich enough to own lovely expensive homes in Notting Hill. With Trump it’s his family. When America voted Trump it didn’t mean Ivanka. Still less did it mean the immaculately liberal Jared Kushner, a Democrat whose influence sometimes seems so dominant you almost wonder why everyone didn’t just give up and vote Hillary, for all the difference it would have made.

Another is his apparent willingness to sell out to the system. Trump had one point of appeal above all: that he wasn’t part of the system. That’s why he galvanised the Republican voter base in the way that none of the other candidates could. People saw him as the anti-Establishment candidate whom they could trust would never be bought. But, as Peter Schweizer noted on Breitbart News Daily, he has a funny way of showing it. What exactly are all these Goldman-Sachsers doing so close to the Administration? Isn’t the Vampire Squid one of the biggest, ugliest creatures in the swamp Trump was supposed to drain?

All this would yet be fine, of course, if Trump were to heed the countervailing voices of the true ideologues in his Administration: the ones who get what needs to be done and who understand the need of the core vote. This is what’s so worrying about the alleged sidelining of Steve Bannon. Trump should be aware of the worrying precedent here, which didn’t end at all well for David Cameron. One of the few genuine conservative thinkers in Cameron’s government was his Education Secretary Michael Gove, whose radical reforms to the sclerotic education system were hugely unpopular with the teachers’ unions, the left generally and its propagandists at the BBC, but which had a transformative effect on the quality of Britain’s schools.

But Cameron – always more interested in headlines than real achievements – ditched Gove after being told by an advisor that Gove’s hardline policies and unapologetic conservatism were considered toxic by mainstream opinion. Later, this grave mistake proved Cameron’s undoing: in the Brexit campaign, during which he had counted on Gove’s support in backing Remain, he was appalled to find Gove fighting for Leave instead. This is one of the reasons why Cameron lost the Referendum and why his period as prime minister ended in such spectacular failure. It’s a lesson that Trump would do well to learn before it’s too late.

Then, of course, there’s that unfortunate business in Syria recently – which many of those of us who rooted for Trump find deeply troubling.

Ann Coulter set out the case against very well in her superb and witty Breitbart diatribe – Lassie Come Home!

War is like crack for presidents. It confers instant gravitas, catapulting them to respectability, bypassing all station stops. They get to make macho pronouncements on a topic where every utterance is seen as august. On the other hand, Trump’s Syrian misadventure is immoral, violates every promise he ran on, and could sink his presidency.

Yes, quite. Cameron made precisely the same mistake in Libya when he set in motion the allied bombing campaign which eventually led to the deposition and death of Gadaffi. Sure Gadaffi was a terrible guy with blood on his hands. But from a Western security point of view – which ought, surely, to be the main priority of US military intervention – ousting him was a disaster. The warring Islamist factions which replaced Gadaffi are infinitely more dangerous to Western interests: as Ambassador Chris Stevens discovered to his cost in Benghazi.

How can President Trump, who previously knew all this stuff, suddenly not know it? Why is this non-Establishment free spirit suddenly enacting the kind of foreign policy one would fully have expected from President Hillary Clinton? How is this what America voted for?

The best complexion one can put all this is that the Tomahawk attack, like the dropping of the MOAB on Islamic State in Afghanistan, and like the sending of the fleet in the direction of North Korea are just a case of muscle flexing, reminding the world who is boss after a disastrous presidency under a man who had no faith in American exceptionalism and who seemed determined to show only weakness to the Muslim world.

Well if that’s the aim, fine. Certainly we mustn’t give up hope yet.

But I have to say, on a personal note, as an Englishman who has taken an awful lot of flak back home for his support of President Trump, I’m starting to get a little nervous.

In fact, in a few days I have to speak in a debate in defence of Trump and his first 100 days. My original plan was to hail him as the populist revolutionary who was finally going to free us all from the shackles of a corrupt, overweening and entrenched liberal elite. But the way things are going, I may have to adjust my position slightly. C’mon Mister President. Cut me some slack here. Please don’t let my best defense be: “Well at least he’s not quite as bad as Barack Obama.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b8468f260:23b9c7f:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Hollywood screenwriters are on the verge of another strike, with health care benefits emerging as a major sticking point in contract negotiations – and in a somewhat ironic twist, the writers’ own efforts to promote the passage of Obamacare in 2009 may have contributed to the precarious predicament in which they find themselves today.

The Writers Guild of America (WGA) – a collection of two labor unions that represent film, television, radio, and new media writers – were set to resume negotiations with television and film production studios on Monday over their new contract, which is scheduled to expire May 1st. However, late Monday, both sides announced that negotiations have been placed on hold until Tuesday, April 25, which leaves just four business days in which to hammer out a deal.

An apparent breakdown in negotiations so close to the contract expiration date has Hollywood studios reportedly bracing for the possibility of an imminent strike.

One major sticking point in the negotiations is the unions’ ailing health care plans, which reportedly face insolvency in three years due in large part to the astronomical rise in costs imposed throughout the health care industry by Obamacare. But in a plot twist usually reserved for their best dramas, it was actually top-tier Hollywood screenwriters that helped create the environment for the controversial bill’s passage.

In 2009, Breitbart News was first to report on an unprecedented effort by the Obama administration to encourage Hollywood writers to insert storylines into TV shows that promoted the President’s agenda, including his proposed healthcare legislation. Publicly launched by then-First Lady Michelle Obama and aided by CNN, the Los Angeles Times, and others, the Hollywood project was initially cloaked as an effort to promote volunteerism – with the overall message being one of selflessness and giving back. The massive initiative was aimed at the TV “showrunners” – or head writers – of sixty television programs, and eventually reached some of America’s most watched series, including Grey’s Anatomy, Criminal Minds, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, Hannah Montana, Extreme Makeover Home Edition, Parks and Recreation, Private Practice, ‘til Death, Desperate Housewives, and 30 Rock, to name a few.

Breitbart News saw through the positioning, ultimately labeling the primetime takeover a “Trojan horse” to push the President’s healthcare legislation – which later came to be known as Obamacare. Our reporting pointed to TV episodes that were, at times, not even remotely subtle.

“People can’t go around without health insurance, this is America,” cried Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ character Christine in the then-popular TV series The New Adventures of Old Christine.

“And forty-five million people don’t have health insurance,” replied her best friend, played by Wanda Sykes.

“What?! Man, I miss reading the paper for two days…why isn’t anyone talking about this?!”

Now facing a cut in their own benefits, it appears Hollywood screenwriters’ chickens are coming home to roost.

Studios will be seeking a reduction in health benefits, and many screenwriters — ironically, given the storylines pushed through their TV shows — may lose their health benefits altogether if they do not meet minimum earnings markers that trigger access to the Guild’s health plans. Some of the blame for storylines advocating for the health care legislation may also fall on the studios – but a full assessment should be included as part of the negotiating process. If the studios take on the full burden, that cost will eventually be passed onto the American public through higher product prices resulting from increased commercial advertising costs.

This week, the Writers Guild of America Negotiating Committee recommended that its screenwriters vote to authorize a strike to increase their leverage with the film studios if their demands are not met. If the two parties don’t reach an agreement, or fail to extend the contract to continue talks, the guilds will initiate a strike presumably starting May 2.

It would mark Hollywood’s first strike with health care benefits as a major negotiating point, a fascinating turn of events given that many of the most vocal Hollywood liberals mercilessly mocked President Trump for failing to reach an agreement to fix Obamacare just last month. With next week’s negotiations, Hollywood may be, unfortunately, giving us another reason to break out the popcorn.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” DNC Chair Tom Perez argued that “if you turn over the sheet” on President Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” executive order, “it probably says ‘Made in China.&apos;”

Perez said, “What we have to do as Democrats, is to articulate very clearly that Donald Trump’s vision for America is a vision for the 1 — top 1% of the 1%. It’s a vision that’s divisive. It — when he talks about the make it in America executive order, if you turn over the sheet on that executive order, it probably says ‘Made in China.’ You’ve got 50 pallets or so of Ivanka’s stuff that’s come into the United States from China and Singapore since roughly the 1st of the year. So, part of what we have to do is expose the fraud of Donald Trump.”

Fox News Channel owner Rupert Murdoch and his family are considering pulling The O’Reilly Factor off air amid accusations of sexual harassment against prime time host Bill O’Reilly, according to a report from Gabriel Sherman in New York magazine.

The pressure on Fox to let Bill O’Reilly go has risen in recent weeks over a string of accusations of sexual harassment, with the longtime host currently on a vacation scheduled to end April 24th.

Earlier this month, The New York Times revealed that $13 million has been paid out from either Fox News or O’Reilly to five women to settle their sexual harassment claims against the host in lieu of litigation, despite O’Reilly’s denial of the merits of their claims.

Fox initially backed O’Reilly over the settlement, arguing that he had “resolved those he regarded as his personal responsibility.”

However, Sherman’s sources claim that Murdoch’s sons, James and Lachlan, have argued that O’Reilly should be let go, but their father Rupert Murdoch opposes the idea.

The report also speculated that the decision could affect the Murdoch family’s pending $14 billion deal to re-buy European-based TV provider Sky, with a decision to sack O’Reilly likely to increase Murdoch’s favorability with media regulators Ofcom.

O’Reilly’s primetime show, The O’Reilly Factor, is at its most popular since its conception in 1996, averaging 3.7 million viewers in its final week before details of the settlement emerged, a 28 percent increase from the previous year, according to Nielsen Research.

Over 90 companies dropped advertising on The O’Reilly Factor over the allegations, while a small group of feminist protesters gathered outside the Fox News headquarters in New York calling on the network to fire O’Reilly.

Last year, Fox News’ longtime chairman Roger Ailes resigned over claims of sexual harassment against several female staff members, including former host Gretchen Carlson and anchor Megyn Kelly.

President Donald Trump supported O’Reilly over the claims, describing him as a “good person” who “hasn’t done anything wrong.”

A mural painted on state property near San Diego—depicting an ICE Agent strangling a Mexican worker as he sends money home—is stirring up a new controversy, according to a San Diego Union Tribune news story.

The new mural is located on the south support pillar under Coronado Bridge at the Interstate 5 underpass in what is now called, “Chicano Park.”

The location of the park was scheduled to become a new CHP substation in the early 1970’s, but protestors from the “Barrio Logan” community staved off the plan, facing off against the state—seizing the land for “chicanos” and demanding that a park be constructed to showcase chicano art.

The mural—painted by Salvador “Sal” Barajas—one of the artists who painted the first “Historical Mural” in the park in 1973 that highlights key figures and history of the Chicano movement, was commissioned by a border activist group known as Border Angels.

Border Angel’s founder, Enrigue Morones has been trying to raise the $10,000 for nearly a decade—but credits Trumps election with the new enthusiasm.

Morones spoke to NBC 7—a local NBC affiliate out of San Diego:

“Since November 8 things have changed…People are outraged, more volunteers, more funds.” He added, “We’re totally opposed to the wall … We know that the wall kills people.”

Not everyone is happy about the new mural. Some San Diego county residents are outraged—calling the mural ‘incendiary’ and ‘anti-American.’

Suellen Shea of Vista, who took issue with some of the imagery Barajas used, told the Union-Tribune: “The artist has talent, but, in my opinion, much of it is offensive and anti-American, especially the ICE agent choking the migrant worker,” Shea reportedly said via email. “American Citizens want safety &amp; sovereignty (enforced borders) for our country. Nothing strange or racist about that – Mexico does too.”

Mural painter Barajas thinks the graphic violence depicted is justified, according to the the Los Angeles Times: “One hand represents U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is responsible for deporting people from the U.S. [and t]he other hand represents Mexican government officials, whose corruption makes it necessary for Mexicans to migrate for work.”

Barajas admits that the “text ‘No Border Wall’ was one of the last things added to the piece,” and is likely what inspired anti-Trump donors to put up the money to denounce the looming border wall.

San Diego has become the locus of the fight over President Trump’s wall over the past few months—as prototypes will soon be constructed nearby in order to meet DHS’s June 1st target date. Organized protests and violent resistance is expected by the agency—and contractors are required to provide adequate security as part of their bids.

A number of Californians have taken to social media to make their opposition known reports the LA Times. “San Diego has many parks,” wrote Carol Hamilton, of Imperial Beach. “Only one is splattered with garish posters and anti-American slurs — Chicano Park. A national shrine? I don’t think so. It’s time to whitewash it and use it as a park and not for politics.”

Chicano Park is not under the control of the city or county of San Diego—the land on which it stands is part of a state easement controlled by CalTrans, who reportedly could revoke the right for any mural to be on California state property.

President Donald Trump’s White House has released the text of his new “hire American” Executive Order, which orders a multi-agency reform of the nation’s many guest-worker programs to help raise Americans’ wages and salaries.

“To create higher wages and employment rates for workers in the United States, and to protect their economic interests, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to rigorously enforce and administer the laws governing entry into the United States of workers from abroad, including section 212(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5)),” says the “Buy American, Hire American” Executive Order.

The memo ordered officials to develop new rules and regulations for the many federal guest-worker programs which keep a population of up to 1.8 million visas workers in the United States. The order does not give a deadline for the process but says:

Sec . 5 . Ensuring the Integrity of the Immigration System in Order to “Hire American .” (a) In order to advance the policy outlined in section 2(b) of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, as soon as practicable, and consistent with applicable law, propose new rules and issue new guidance, to supersede or revise previous rules and guidance if appropriate, to protect the interests of United States workers in the administration of our immigration system, including through the prevention of fraud or abuse. (b) In order to promote the proper functioning of the H-1B visa program, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, as soon as practicable, suggest reforms to help ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.

The White House also released a statement from Steve Miller, one of Trump’s senior advisors and one of the White House’s strongest advocates for labor-supply and immigration reform. “This historic act of leadership from President Trump makes unequivocally clear that this Administration will serve and protect the American worker – fighting for fair trade and immigration policies that promote rising wages and employment for our hardworking citizens,” said the statement attributed to Miller.

The new policy was praised by pro-American reformers., even though there’s a big gap between a Trump directive and actual day-to-day government policy amid intense industry pressure for cheaper labor.

“The president’s Executive Order is a shot in the arm for America’s struggling middle-class workers, and must now be followed up with legislation that makes permanent changes to our immigration system so it truly benefits America and its citizens,” said a statement from Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. He continued:

Employers should be required to hire American workers who meet minimum job requirements and the foreign workers they do hire must be required to be paid a fair, market wage. We cannot achieve the goal of ‘hiring American’ while maintaining a policy that allows them to bypass Americans in favor of foreign guest workers.

GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate’s judiciary committee, praised the directive, saying:

The H-1B program was designed to fill gaps in America’s workforce with highly-skilled foreign workers, but as we’ve seen in recent years, the program has been abused and exploited at the expense of American workers and most-qualified foreign workers. We’ve seen companies use the program to fire American workers and replace them with lower-paid foreign counterparts. The visa lottery system makes this problem worse by rewarding visas randomly, instead of prioritizing foreign workers with greater experience, skill, and qualifications. I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Durbin to address these problems, and I’ve expressed to President Trump the need to take action to restore the integrity in the H-1B Program. I’m grateful that President Trump has taken my suggestions to heart by taking steps today to protect American workers and preserve limited H-1B visas for truly qualified, high-skilled foreign workers.

Industry officials rolled with the punch. A statement from Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us cheap-lobby group praised the new directive but also asked for even more foreign workers.The statement said:

We are hopeful today’s announcement will do what FWD.us has long advocated; improve our high skilled immigration system. We should do so in a targeted manner by increasing the wage floor, treating super-dependent companies (50 employees and 50% or more of domestic workforce H-1Bs) differently and banning their ability to do third-party placement. Highly-skilled immigrants create new American jobs, raise wages for native-born workers, and contribute enormously to growing our economy. Finally, congress should expand the number of H-1B visas offered while reforming the system to protect American workers.

Read the directive here.

The annual inflow of foreign contract workers is huge, adding up to roughly 1 million short-term or long-term workers, either in white-collar or blue-collar jobs. The imported contract workers are not immigrants, not citizens, nor green card holders, but are temporary workers slated to return home after several years. Generally, employers do not have to interview Americans before hiring foreigners for the U.S.-based jobs.

Many of the contract workers stay for several or more years, ensuring the resident population of white-collar and blue-collar contract workers is much larger than the annual inflow and may reach a resident population of 1.8 million. The left-wing Economic Policy Institute pegs the resident population at 1.4 million.

Many blue-collar workers stay for just one season, filling jobs as landscapers or beach workers, waiters and foresters, fish processors and farm workers. These blue-collar temp programs get a lot of criticism, partly because some employers cheat their foreign workers, but they are supported by many local politicians who are trying to help donors and influential business leaders. This seasonal inflow has sharply reduced the number of Americans teenagers working during the summer.

Most of the white-collar workers stay for several or more years, ensuring the resident population of white-collar contract workers is must larger than the annual inflow. For example, the annual inflow of H-1B white-collar guest-workers is roughly 110,000, but the resident population is almost one million, according to a recent estimate by Goldman Sachs. The federal government releases little data on the many different guest-worker programs, but the available evidence says the national population of white-collar contract workers is up to 1.5 million. That population is roughly twice the population of 800,000 Americans who graduate from college with skilled degrees each year.

Several sites, including here and here, show numbers of H-1B outsourcing visas requested by companies and non-profits. The sites also show where the requested workers will work, their job titles and their supposed wages. For example, the sites show the number of visas for foreign pharmacists sought by CVS and other companies and the number of visas for architects and industrial designers sought by so-called “job shop” firms which outsource their imported workers to other U.S. companies.

The inflow of contract workers forces down wages paid to Americans and immigrants, partly because the inflow reduces wage pressure on blue-collar and white-collar employers. Moreover, many of the contract workers rationally and decently will take jobs are low wages because their employers can promise to eventually reward them with the massively valuable deferred bonus of a green card and then U.S. citizenship. Each year, companies request and receive 140,000 green cards for their white-collar employees and their families, further boosting the supply of professionals in the white-collar labor market.

Employers say they need the foreign workers because they can’t hire enough Americans for blue-collar jobs, even at wages of $12 per hour or higher.

But critics — and much evidence — say the programs are rife with corruption, including fake resumes, fraudulent visa applications, under-the-table payments, workplace and hiring discrimination against Americans, as well as false claims by lobbyists and corporates that too few Americans want to work at companies such as Goldman Sachs or Facebook or in the New York fashion industry.

A 2016 report by the National Academies of Science showed that cheap-labor gues-workers programs, plus the must large inflow of legal immigrants, annually transfers roughly $500 billion from American employees over to investors and employers.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b839f9779:235b835:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump is getting praise from experts on the H-1B foreign guest worker visa for his ‘Hire American’ Executive Order which calls for a review into the system’s abuse at the expense of American workers.

Although the H-1B visa is only meant to be used by a U.S. company when there are no American workers with the skill-set needed for the job, critics argue the program is riddled with abuse and fraud, leaving Americans to sometimes train their cheaper, foreign replacements before being fired.

Trump’s new executive order targeting abuse by U.S. companies, as Breitbart News reported, calls for the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Labor Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a “full legal analysis” of all the problems negatively impacting American workers in the H-1B visa system.

H-1B expert and attorney John Miano told Breitbart Texas that Trump’s move on the issue is one that is setting the administration on the right trajectory.

“We’re going to want to see some follow-ups later on,” Miano said in an interview. “But you can’t criticize the president for taking action. This is what we elected him for.”

Miano said the fact that Trump is mentioning the H-1B visa program, an issue that went unaddressed by at least the past two administrations, is “very big.”

Likewise, Sara Blackwell, an attorney who represents Americans who’ve been fired because programs like the H-1B, applauded Trump’s move.

“We hope it’s a beginning of a lot more. I’m hopeful,” Blackwell told Breitbart Texas. “But, I’m extremely happy that President Trump is talking about it and acknowledging there’s a huge problem.”

The legal review by DOJ, the DOL and DHS will include tracking down abuses within the H-1B visa program where more than 85,000 Americans are either replaced or passed over for jobs by foreign nationals.

Experts like NumberUSA’s Rosemary Jenks and the Center for Immigration Studies’ Mark Krikorian both said the multi-agency legal review approach by the Trump Administration is the right way to go about ending the mass discrimination against American workers that currently takes place.

“I do think it’s the right approach to take because [DOJ, Labor Dept. and DHS] have different roles to play,” Jenks told Breitbart Texas. “Abuse is handled by the Labor Department. DHS is the agency that’s setting requirements for admission. And DOJ is prosecuting the abusers. This is definitely the right approach. I hope the administration will continue talking to outside groups.”

“Clearly, by indicating that all three departments have to do a review of the program, the White House is making clear they understand the process,” Krikorian told Breitbart Texas. “The initial clearinghouse is the Department of Labor. A lot of the cheap labor aspects can be addressed by the Labor Department’s regulations and statutes.”

Krikorian said he was glad to see the Trump Administration calling for a broad review into the H-1B visa system, rather than taking smaller, administrative actions.

“At the same time, it’s encouraging that they didn’t just try to change H-1B unilaterally, they understand there’s a lot of moving parts to it,” Krikorian said. “They know a lot of this has to be fixed by Congress.”

Before the Executive Order, the Trump administration worried critics of the H-1B visa after not making any changes to the system before the application process began. For instance, the Trump Administration could have changed the H-1B system from its current state of handing out visas through a random lottery, switching it to a process where the highest-paying jobs are given priority.

Krikorian, though, told Breitbart Texas that the lack of prior change to H-1B was mostly likely not politically driven, but rather the administration simply running out of time on the issue.

Nonetheless, the new executive order has changed the outlook Americans impacted by the H-1B have on the Trump administration, Blackwell said.

“Well the people who are affected by this and know this businesses model were extremely deflated when the H-1B application process started without changes,” Blackwell said. “Now, they’ve gone from hopeless to hopeful.”

Last week, Breitbart Texas exclusively reported how Trump Senior Adviser Stephen Miller held a White House meeting on the H-1B visa issue with longtime critics like Blackwell and Howard University professor Ron Hira.

An Oregon man died peacefully in his home after his ex-wife lied to him and told him President Trump was impeached.

Michael Garland Elliott, 75, passed away on April 6 surrounded by friends, caregivers, and neighbors who loved him, the New York Daily News reported.

Teresa Elliott, 68, Michael’s ex-wife who is described as his “best friend” in his obituary published in the Oregonian, told the Daily News that she told him Trump was impeached over the phone from her home in Austin, Texas.

“I knew it was his very, very last moments,” Teresa Elliott said. “I knew that would bring him comfort and it did. He then took his final breath.”

Teresa said Michael, who died from congestive heart failure after experiencing a decline in his health for years, was a “news junkie” who frequently voiced his disapproval of Trump.

“He hated his effing guts,” she said of Michael’s opinion of the president.

Even though the couple divorced 20 years ago, Teresa said she would visit often and cared for him.

When the Daily News asked Teresa if she regretted telling Michael fake news, she replied,“Oh, God no.”

“If I could leave him with a happy piece of news then why wouldn’t I?” she said. “And maybe in the end it won’t turn out to be a lie.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b837ee764:227bfe6:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is no longer “shielding” non-felon aliens who are present in the US illegally, and arrests among that group have doubled since President Trump took office, according to a Washington Post report:

“[Illegal Alien] arrests rose 32.6 percent in the first weeks of the Trump administration, with newly empowered federal agents intensifying their pursuit of not just [aliens] with criminal records, but also thousands of illegal [aliens] who have been otherwise law-abiding.”

“[ICE] arrested 21,362 [illegal aliens], mostly convicted criminals, from January through mid-March, compared to 16,104 during the same period last year,” according to statistics obtained by the Post.

In what may be the first clear sign that President Trump means to break with the policies of his predecessor, ICE spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea, said in a statement “anyone in the United States illegally could be deported.”

Elzea’s statement went on to say that while ICE “focuses its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security…[Homeland Security] Secretary [John] Kelly has made clear, ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.”

There were 5,441 arrests of non-criminal aliens, more than double the total from last year, according to Fox News’ Adam Housley, who reported Monday that “ICE detainers—requests to local authorities to hold criminal aliens—are up 75 percent, to more than 22,000.”

On NBC’s “Meet the Press” this past Sunday, Kelly made it clear that the definition of “criminal” has not changed, “but where on the spectrum of criminality we operate has changed.”

In Housely’s report, Kelly said ICE agents may move to deport an individual with multiple DUI offenses—even though in the past, those individuals would have been “unlikely” to be deported.

“The law deports people. Secretary Kelly doesn’t. ICE doesn’t. It’s the United States criminal justice system that deports people,” Kelly said.

Even though Trump’s arrest and deportation statistics haven’t surpassed Obama’s according to The Week, “It’s the tactics Trump’s ICE agents use — arresting [illegal] immigrants in state and local courthouses and on the way to work, as well as apparently targeting immigrant advocates who speak out — that has struck terror into [illegal] immigrant communities.”

The threat of enforcement has reportedly resulted in fewer crimes being reported in some communities heavily populated by illegal aliens. Whether or not that’s because the threat of enforcement has led potential criminals to lay low—or potential victims from reporting crime—remains to be seen.

It’s worthy to note that almost every media source that covered this story made reference to how the “vast majority” of the 11 million illegal aliens in the US who are not felons, are “otherwise law-abiding.” There are two problems with that narrative. First, the 11 million number has been quoted by media sources since 2005—even though a source is never quoted. The number could be substantially more. Best-selling author Ann Coulter suggest the number of illegal aliens in the United States could be as high as 30 million.

Secondly, there are countless examples of ordinary illegal aliens, whose first crime resulted in the tragic murder of a person who would otherwise be alive—had the law been enforced and unlawful aliens removed.

Tuesday in Kenosha, WI at the world headquarters of Snap-on Inc., President Donald Trump called on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), who is on a bipartisan congressional trip visiting NATO countries, to get members of NATO “to pay their bills.”

Trump said,”And although he could not be here today, my thanks go to Speaker Ryan who’s represented the city for nearly two decades in Congress. And you know where he is? He’s with NATO. And — so he has a good excuse. And I said Ron, make sure these countries start paying their bills a little bit more, you know. They’re way, way behind. We have to do — well I’m going to talk to you about that, Ron. But Paul, you’re over with NATO, get them to pay their bills. I think that — and Ron you have to work on that too.”

During an interview broadcast on Tuesday’s “Fox &amp; Friends” on the Fox News Channel, President Trump denied that he had softened his stance on China with regards to trade and China being a currency manipulator.

Trump said, “I didn’t soften my stance. … Now, what am I going to do, start a trade war with China in the middle of him working on a bigger problem, frankly, with North Korea? So, I’m dealing with China with great respect. I have great respect for him. We’ll see what he can do. Now, maybe he won’t be able to help. That’s possible. I think he’s trying, but maybe he won’t be able to help.”

He added, “What am I going to do, in the middle of him talking with North Korea, I’m going to hit them with currency manipulation? This is the fake media that just does a number. … I haven’t changed my stance. China’s trying to help us. I don’t know if they’re going to be able to or not. But, would I want to start heavy, heavy trade or currency statements against somebody that’s out there right now trying to stop what could be a very bad situation?”

Facebook has reportedly stated that employees that leave work on May 1st to protest Donald Trump’s immigration policies will not be punished by the company.

Bloomberg reports that Facebook staff have been given the green light by their employer to participate in protests on May 1st. The company also stated in their internal announcement that they will investigate any contractors on Facebook grounds, such as security workers or shuttle bus drivers, that illegally crack down on their employees’ right to protest.

“At Facebook, we’re committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions and speaking up,” a spokesman wrote in a statement. “We support our people in recognizing International Workers’ Day and other efforts to raise awareness for safe and equitable employment conditions.”

Derecka Mehrens, the co-founder of Silicon Valley Rising, a union initiative for tech workers, stated, “It’s important not just to the engineers and H-1B holders that are traditionally thought of as the immigrants in tech but also to folks who are subcontracted but work side-by-side on those campuses. Immigrants play a critical role in the tech sector — both as engineers and coders but also in keeping tech campuses running smoothly.”

Many tech companies in Silicon Valley have been vocal opponents of President Trump since his election. Companies such as Google held protests across their campuses where they attacked President Trump’s temporary immigration halt.

CEO Sunar Pichai spoke to the crowd about the difficulties that the company faces attempting to deal with the visa complications many of their foreign employees encountered, thanking all those who appeared at the march. “Every step, I felt the support of 65,000 people behind me,” he said. “There are some values that you should never be compromising on, we need to stand together. The fight will continue.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b82e27998:2187697:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Several voting machines were stolen in Georgia as the state gears up for a hotly contested special election to replace a Republican who left Congress to take a job in the Trump administration, reports say.

The devices were taken on Monday from a Cobb County precinct manager’s vehicle, according to Channel 2 Acton News.

In a public statement, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp said, “It is unacceptable that the Cobb County Elections Office waited two days to notify my office of this theft.”

“We have opened an investigation, and we are taking steps to ensure that it has no effect on the election tomorrow. I am confident that the results will not be compromised,” Kemp added.

Cobb County’s elections director, Janine Eveler, insisted that the information on the machines is “hard to access” and says she does not think the thieves will be able to interfere in the election.

The election has been called to fill the House seat vacated by Rep. Tom Price, who left Congress to become President Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services.

In 2016, Price won his seat by a lopsided 20 points in the conservative Sixth District.

The GOP side of the election features a crowded field of 11 candidates, but there are five Democrat candidates, as well. Democrat candidate Jon Ossoff, a former congressional staffer, seems to be the favorite on the left, with actors and activists aligning behind him and raising funds for him.

The election pits all candidates against one other, but to win outright, the top vote-getter must garner 50 percent or more. If no candidate gets that 50 percent, a runoff election will determine the winner.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions is echoing President Donald Trump’s sentiments toward the violent El Salvadorian MS-13 gang, blaming “years of lax immigration enforcement” for their growing presence across the U.S.

Sessions made the comments during a meeting with law enforcement task forces handling crime syndicate issues, according to the LA Times:

“Because of an open border and years of lax immigration enforcement, MS-13 has been sending both recruiters and members to regenerate gangs that previously had been decimated, and smuggling members across the border as unaccompanied minors,” Sessions said. He added that “sanctuary cities dangerously undermine” attempts to battle the group. “Harboring criminal aliens only helps violent gangs like MS-13,” Sessions said.

Sessions also noted the brutality of the MS-13 gang, saying “they are not content to simply ruin the lives of adults — MS-13 recruits in our high schools, our middle schools and even our elementary schools.”

Sessions’ remarks are a close resemblance to those of Trump’s, who most recently slammed previous administration’s immigration enforcement for allowing the MS-13 gang to take root in the U.S., as Breitbart News reported.

“The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S,” Trump said on Twitter. “We are removing them fast!”

The MS-13 gang made headlines this week after four young men, including an honor roll student, were found dead in a park in Central Islip, New York, with law enforcement tracing the murders back to the criminal organization.

Previously, the Center for Immigration Studies has reported how the mass immigration of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children into communities like Brentwood, New York have led to the region becoming a breeding for the MS-13 gang.

President Donald Trump announced a new executive order to promote his America First agenda, ordering the federal government to implement his buy American, and hire American policies.

“With this action, we’re sending a powerful signal to the world and we’re going to defend our workers, protect our jobs, and finally put America first,” he said during a speech he delivered after touring Snap-On Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Trump ordered the federal government to promote and use American-made products and hire American workers, signing the document at the event.

“No longer are we going to allow foreign countries to cheat our producers and our workers out of federal contracts,” he said.

He also called for H-1B Visa reform, asserting that the current lottery system was “wrong,” and should be focused on only allowing in immigrants with the “most skilled and highest paid applicants.”

“No one can compete with American workers when they are given a fair and level playing field, which has not happened for decades,” he said.

Trump vowed trade reform with Mexico and Canada, promising to make big changes to NAFTA or get rid of it altogether.

“NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States,” he said. “A complete and total disaster.”

He specifically called for changes to the trade policy with Canada on dairy products, referring to the dairy industry in Wisconsin.

Trump also vowed to use every legal tool in his administration to cut federal regulations that were hurting business and killing jobs.

“In fact, when it comes to job-killing regulations, we’re going to use a tool you all know very well. It’s called the sledgehammer,” he said with a grin.

Trump thanked Governor Scott Walker for joining him at the event together with Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson.

Walker presented Trump with a personalized NBA Wisconsin Bucks jersey and a parody of his campaign hat.

Since the @Bucks are in the #NBAPlayoffs tonight, we made a special hat to give to the @POTUS. #MAGA pic.twitter.com/qMNvFXsb4G — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) April 18, 2017

Speaker Paul Ryan was not at the event, even though it was his district, as he was meeting with NATO representatives in Europe.

“He has a good excuse,” Trump said. “Paul, you’re over with NATO; get them to pay their bills.”

Trump was also joined by his Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, a Wisconsin native, Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, and Education Secretary Betsy Devos. His advisers Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway also traveled with the president to the event.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b82a152a3:1f35b3a:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

SYDNEY (AP) – Australia will scrap a temporary visa for skilled overseas workers, the prime minister said Tuesday, arguing that Australians must be given priority over foreigners for local jobs.

The popular 457 visa, which allows foreigners to live and work in Australia for up to four years, will be replaced with a stricter scheme that requires a criminal background check and includes tougher English language requirements, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said. The list of occupations that qualify for the new visa will be sharply reduced.

“We are an immigration nation, but the fact remains: Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs,” Turnbull said in a Facebook video announcing the change.

The decision by Australia comes one day before President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order that will make changes to a visa program that brings high-skilled workers to the U.S. The White House said the current visa program undercuts American workers by bringing in cheaper labor.

Australia’s 457 visa was created to address shortages of local workers in certain skilled professions. But critics argued that businesses abused it by paying foreigners lower wages than most Australians would accept.

Turnbull said the new visa scheme would ensure that businesses only bring in foreign workers who are crucial to filling shortages of critical skills.

“It is focused relentlessly on the national interest and in ensuring that temporary migration visas are not a passport for foreigners to take up jobs that could and should be filled by Australians,” Turnbull told reporters in the nation’s capital, Canberra.

The 95,000 people already in Australia on 457 visas will not be affected by the change.

Members of Australia’s far-right political parties, particularly the anti-immigration One Nation party, were fierce critics of the 457 visa, arguing that it was allowing foreign workers to steal jobs from Australians.

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson took to Twitter on Tuesday to claim credit for Turnbull’s decision.

“The government will deny their tough talk on immigration and plan to ban 457 visas is because of One Nation but we all know the truth!” Hanson tweeted.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b82a152a3:1f35b39:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with leaders from across federal law enforcement Tuesday to address transnational organized crime.

“Let me state this clearly. Under President Trump, the Justice Department has ZERO tolerance for gang violence,” Sessions told the press in a prepared statement before the meeting of the Attorney General’s Organized Crime Council. The group, which has met since 1970, is made up of representatives from the many federal agencies and inter-agency task forces that address organized crime in America.

Sessions touted President Donald Trump’s February executive order on criminal gangs as leading the way for efforts to dismantle the international criminal organizations responsible for a large amount of the violence, drug trafficking, and human exploitation in this country. “Today, we’ll be proposing concrete ideas to follow through on President Trump’s directive,” he said.

The Attorney General singled out the particularly brutal gang Mara Salvatrucha, commonly known as “MS-13” for his attention:

MS-13 has become a symbol of this plague that has spread across our country and into our communities. There are over 30,000 members abroad with their headquarters in the El Salvadoran prison system. According to the National Gang Intelligence Center, MS-13 now has more than 10,000 members in at least 40 states in this country—up significantly from just a few years ago.

MS-13 originated among Salvadorans in Los Angeles, California, many of whom fled to this country in the 1980s to escape El Salvador’s horrific civil war and the right-wing death squads operating throughout Central America at the time. Today, MS-13 is made up of tens of thousands of members, primarily Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and their descendants in the United States. Operating without any regard for national borders, the gang has brought the kind of atrocities once confined to Central America’s political conflicts with it wherever it has spread.

Recently, MS-13 has been linked to a string gruesome murders across the United States. Last Wednesday, the bodies of four men and boys aged 16-20 were found in suburban Long Island, New York. The victims were tortured and mutilated to the point their tattoos had to used to identify them. Two additional bodies were discovered last in Fairfax, Virginia, only a few dozen miles from the Capital Dome, too badly disfigured to be identified. Details in each case led authorities to suspect the involvement of MS-13, whose members have faced justice for countless similarly brutal crimes.

MS-13 operates under the motto “kill, rape, control,” according to a DOJ fact sheet on the group. Justice officials believe that when MS-13 crews in the United States are not aggressive or ruthless enough, their leaders in El Salvador’s prisons warn them to keep to “La Programma” – The Program – understood to mean stepping up the violence and brutality in their allotted territory to increase the gang’s power and territory.

Sessions compared the group to the Mafia and the Colombian cartels, two once imposing criminal groups brought low by federal law enforcement in the past.

Attorney General Sessions linked the transnational gang problem to immigration issues:

Because of an open border and years of lax immigration enforcement, MS-13 has been sending both recruiters and members to regenerate gangs that previously had been decimated, and smuggling members across the border as unaccompanied minors.

Sessions has made enforcement of our immigration laws a centerpiece of his tenure at Justice. He has stated that gang members will be among those illegal aliens who will be a top priority for deportation. Many of MS-13 and other gangs’ members are illegals, and efforts are being stepped up to remove them from the country. On Saturday, the Attorney General confirmed to Fox News’s Judge Jeanine Pirro that gang affiliation alone will be enough to qualify illegal aliens for priority removal.

Sessions specifically hit upon so-called “sanctuary cities” for the role they play, according to him, in providing harbor to members of MS-13 and other gangs. “Sanctuary cities are aiding these cartels to refill their ranks and putting innocent life – including the lives of countless law-abiding immigrants – in danger,” he said. Sessions’ DOJ is looking into methods to compel these jurisdictions to comply with federal immigration laws and cooperate with federal authorities. Some sanctuary city leaders, however, are resisting these efforts.

Answering questions from the press after his address, Sessions acknowledged the need to move quickly to confirm his new Justice Department team, including all 94 United States Attorneys. The Attorney General has previously expressed dismay at the slow pace of confirmations in the new administration. Tuesday he said he hoped to have all these important positions filled with competent prosecutors.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b82a152a3:1f35b37:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A slew of Hollywood’s most liberal and politically-engaged stars have donated money and their elevated media reach to help elect Jon Ossoff, a Democratic candidate in Georgia’s Sixth District special election, in what has become something of a symbolic show of resistance to Donald Trump’s presidency.

Voters in the suburban Atlanta congressional district will head to the polls Tuesday to replace longtime Congressman Tom Price, who became President Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary in February.

The extensive celebrity presence in this relatively small congressional contest appears to underscore just how much Hollywood wants to win against a president that handed them a crushing blow in November.

Some stars, like actor John Leguizamo, believe democracy itself hinges on Tuesday’s special election.

“The end of democracy looks nigh,” the John Wick star told Politico for a feature story about Hollywood’s influence on the Georgia election. “I think we all realize we can’t sit back, we can’t take things for granted. We can’t sit back and hope that somebody else does something, we have to do whatever we can, [so] we all gotta get woke, and that’s the mandate. I wish there were more outspoken celebrities, athletes, artists, people with high profiles.”

Actor Samuel L. Jackson — who previously said he’d leave the country if Trump were elected president — cut a 45-second radio ad endorsing Ossoff, urging Georgia voters to “stop Donald Trump, a man who encourages racial and religious discrimination and sexism.”

On Monday, fierce Trump critic and talk show host Chelsea Handler tweeted, “For everyone in Georgia’s 6th district, tomorrow is a big day. Pls get out and #VoteYourOssoff. Let’s send a message tomorrow.”

For everyone in Georgia&apos;s 6th district, tomorrow is a big day. Pls get out and #VoteYourOssoff. Let&apos;s send a message tomorrow. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) April 17, 2017

Handler had previously urged voters to head to the polls on the wrong day.

Special elections today in Georgia. Vote for @JonOssoff in Georgia. He&apos;s our man. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) April 11, 2017

Apart from their extended reach on social media, Hollywood liberals have opened their wallets to Ossoff, a 30-year-old filmmaker-turned-politician.

Actresses Jane Fonda and Kyra Sedgwick and longtime Law and Order star Sam Waterston have all contributed to Ossoff’s campaign, according to Politico. The candidate has reportedly amassed a hefty $8.3 million from nearly 200,000 donors, with more than 95 percent of those contributions coming from out of state.

Other left-wing stars, like actors Alyssa Milano and Christopher Gorham, have personally driven people to early voting sites for Ossoff.

No joke. Call 678-636-9551 and @Alyssa_Milano and I WILL PICK YOU UP and take you to early vote! Now. @ossoff #Georgia6th pic.twitter.com/HA3nGuirQr — Christopher Gorham (@ChrisGorham) March 27, 2017

“It is the seat heard round the world. Everyone is watching. All the recent special elections have taken on a certain symbolism of the resistance,” Milano told Politico.

The Who’s The Boss and Charmed actress also said it is crucial for celebrities to use their fame to fight for the causes they believe in.

“I want people to find what motivates them and if I can be a catalyst for the strength for them to fight for what’s right, then I feel good about what I’m doing,” Milano told the outlet.

Major changes are underway at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), a new report finds.

In a piece by USA Today, it is revealed that under the direction of Secretary John Kelly, the lax Obama-era guidelines for DHS attorneys in immigration court have been thrown out, resulting in the department seeking deportation for “nearly every immigration case”:

The new directives vastly broaden the pool of undocumented immigrants considered for deportation. The result has been a jarring shift in which the government seeks deportation in nearly every immigration case, said Clarel Cyriaque, a defense attorney who represents Haitians in South Florida. Dozens of his clients were under consideration for prosecutorial discretion based on their years in the U.S., steady employment and clean records. “That’s off the table now,” he said. “As soon as Trump took office, everything stopped. They got new marching orders. Their prime directive now is enforcement, as opposed to exercising discretion that would help good people.” Homeland Security says its attorneys can still practice discretion on a case-by-case basis. But a statement released after Trump signed his executive order on immigration in January states, “With extremely limited exceptions, DHS will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement.”

Unlike President Donald Trump’s administration, the Obama administration asked DHS attorneys to only seek deportations of criminal illegal immigrants, whereas Trump’s DHS sees every illegal immigrant as a law-breaker.

“Homeland Security says its attorneys can still practice discretion on a case-by-case basis,” the USA Today report notes. “But a statement released after Trump signed his executive order on immigration in January states, ‘With extremely limited exceptions, DHS will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement.’”

Aside from DHS attorneys being more likely now to push for the deportation of almost every illegal immigrant, whether or a violent crime is a factor, immigration judges are also setting higher bonds; preventing them from being released and then fleeing to unknown locations, attorney Yanci Montes told USA Today.

Sessions’ DOJ has quickly identified the backlog problem in the immigration system, where illegal immigrants are detained in the U.S. for sometimes three years before having their case heard by an immigration judge.

As Breitbart Texas reported, the Trump Administration is moving 50 judges to detention facilities in areas like Adelanto and San Diego, California; as well as Chicago, Illinois. The DOJ budget also asks for funds to hire an additional 75 judges.

There are more than 500,000 pending immigration court cases for illegal immigrants, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ramped-up arrests of illegal aliens during the first weeks of President Trump’s term.

According to newly released statistics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), originally requested by The Washington Post, arrests of illegal aliens increased 32.6 percent during the first several weeks of the Trump Administration.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 21,362 illegal aliens from January 20 through March 13, an increase of 5,258 from the same period in 2016.

Nearly 75 percent of those arrested, a total of 17,921, are criminal illegal aliens. The number of non-criminal illegal aliens arrested has more than doubled.

A spokeswoman for ICE said that the focus remains primarily on those who are a danger to the security of U.S., anyone who is in the U.S. illegally can face deportation.

“…As [Homeland Security] Secretary [John F.] Kelly has made clear, ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea said in a statement.

The total number of illegal aliens who have been deported, not just arrested, is down by 1.2 percent compared to the same period last year. Eleza explained it takes time to move forward with deportation proceedings after arresting an illegal alien. Overall, the total number arrested increased by 15 percent compared to the same period last year.

Since President Trump took office on January 20, the apprehension of illegal aliens attempting to enter the United States has decreased by 61 percent, as reported by Breitbart Texas.

The president of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC), U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brandon Judd, told Fox Business Channel’s Stuart Varney, “the handcuffs are being taken off the law enforcement agents, and we’re putting the handcuffs back on the criminals.”

Texas congressional Republicans want to pump the brakes for funding a border wall as a government shutdown looms.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) questioned the concept of placing funding for the border wall into a continuing resolution when Democrats said they would not support such a deal, The Daily Caller reported.

“We’re not going to write a blank check,” McCaul said while speaking at Lone Star College. “And me working with the appropriators, we’re basically going to put conditions on it that better define how this thing is accomplished.”

McCaul expressed uncertainty whether a border wall is the answer and wants to wait and see if there are any additional costs before making any decision.

“We have 1,200 miles out of a 2,000-mile border, and I don’t think a 30-foot concrete wall is going to be the answer,” McCaul said.

McCaul’s colleague, Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX), wants additional information before allocating funds for its construction. Hurd, along with Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ), co-authored a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney voicing concerns over the border wall since their districts comprise 880 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border.

“As representatives of the communities that make up the southern border, we recognize the need for robust border security,” they said in the letter. “We also have an obligation to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars and as such have a number of questions.”

Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) said he does not believe President Trump is serious about the wall.

“When I hear the president talk about the wall I think he’s speaking metaphorically,” Cornyn said.

Breitbart Texas previously reported that House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled a concession that funding for the border wall would not be a part of the GOP budget.

Other Republicans like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) are more concerned about not offending Mexico than they are about keeping Americans safe

“There is a lot of anti-American sentiment in Mexico,” McCain previously said. “If the election were tomorrow in Mexico, you’d probably have a left-wing, anti-American president in Mexico. That can’t be good for America.”

President Donald Trump sent a message to criminal illegal immigrants, Tuesday morning, particularly members of gangs like MS-13.

“They are getting the hell out or they are going to prison,” Trump said in an interview with Fox and Friends.

Trump praised his Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for enforcing the laws.

“I will tell you we have gotten tremendous criminals out of this country,” he said, pointing to the illegal immigrants who were murdering and raping innocent people. Trump called criminal behavior from illegal immigrants a serious problem that he was working to fix.

“So many towns and cities are thanking me because we have gotten rid of a burden that you would not believe,” he said.

On Twitter, Trump specifically vowed to tackle the MS-13 gang problem.

“The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S,” he said. “We are removing them fast!”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b81b03c0e:1d8fdbc:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Beijing’s message to the Trump administration that it would take an active role in diminishing tensions on the Korean peninsula has apparently reached Pyongyang. North Korean officials have reportedly not responded to requests from the Chinese government to meet for diplomatic talks.

Bloomberg cites “people familiar with the situation” confirming that two high-ranking Chinese officials – Foreign Minister Wang Yi and top Korean affairs diplomat Wu Dawei – had reached out to North Korean officials hoping for dialogue. The officials did not receive a response.

The effort appeared to be related to both President Xi Jinping’s meeting with President Donald Trump in Florida this month and with Chinese officials’ meetings with South Korean diplomats to discuss the situation on the peninsula.

Bloomberg notes that the lack of response from Pyongyang may not necessarily set a new precedent, as “it’s unclear how often Chinese officials request to visit North Korean counterparts, and how often they don’t get a response.”

During the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s regular press conference Monday, spokesman Lu Kang did not answer whether the Chinese government sent an envoy to Pyongyang’s military parade Saturday. The parade took place on the “Day of the Sun,” a major North Korean holiday celebrating the birthday of dictator Kim Il-sung, founder of the communist DPRK. “We have said from this podium that China and the DPRK are friendly neighbors. The two sides maintain the tradition of friendly exchanges,” he responded to a reporter asking which Chinese official had attended the parade.

Lu also appeared to deny that Wu Dawei had visited North Korea over the weekend for bilateral discussions; such a visit would negate the Bloomberg report. “I wonder where you got that information,” Lu responded to a reporter’s inquiry.

Of the United States, Lu said Chinese officials “welcome the positive role played by the US, one of the most important parties in this issue.” “We would like to remain in close communication with all relevant parties including the US to jointly contribute to realizing denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, maintaining peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula, and resolving the Korean Peninsula issue through peaceful negotiations,” he concluded.

Vice President Mike Pence is currently in South Korea to discuss, among other issues, the North Korean crisis. In a speech from the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ), Pence warned China that the United States will not coexist with a nuclear North Korea. “Either China will deal with this problem or the United States and its allies will. We want to see change. we want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path,” he said.

Also this week, Trump administration National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, in remarks to ABC News, said he believes the Chinese government had become part of an “international consensus” that the status quo on the Korean peninsula could not persist.

Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, had harsh words for North Korea during a press conference last week. Rather than insisting the United States must stop joint military exercises with South Korea, Wang made clear North Korea was just as much a belligerent party in the dispute. Given China’s status as North Korea’s largest trading partner and diplomatic ally, his remarks appeared to indicate that Chinese policy regarding North Korea was changing.

“There has been heightened tension between the United States, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). This precarious situation deserves our attention and concern,” Wang warned. “If war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, multiple parties will lose and no one will win.”

Following Xi’s in-person meeting with Trump, China also moved to limit its ties to the rogue fellow communist regime. Chinese officials forced a North Korean cargo ship to return home carrying coal, an attempt to enforce United Nations trade sanctions against Pyongyang. Reports also indicated that China placed 150,000 troops on its border with North Korea in anticipation of the “Day of the Sun.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b81a316af:1f4256c:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

More than 100 of the biggest names in music have lent their autographs to an acoustic guitar set to be raffled off next month to benefit Planned Parenthood.

Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, John Legend and the Foo Fighters are just some of the 102 artists who have put their names down on the Gibson CJ-165 acoustic guitar, which will be raffled off in May by the charity group 7 Inches for Planned Parenthood.

According to the contest page, the guitar was donated by the Old Style Guitar Shop in Los Angeles and its owner, Reuben Cox, who spent five months collecting the celebrity signatures after being “spurred into action” following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 presidential election.

The guitar, according to the contest page, represents a “reflection of a group of concerned, like-minded artists at an important crossroad in American history.”

Other big-name artists who have added their signatures to the instrument include Michael Stipe, Danny Elfman, Jim James (My Morning Jacket), Ryan Adams, Henry Rollins, Sam Smith, Nancy Sinatra, Mark Ronson, Fred Armisen, Queens of the Stone Age, Charlie Puth, and Gary Clark Jr.

Those interested in winning the guitar can enter by making a $10 donation to Planned Parenthood through the contest page. The Gibson CJ-165 guitar retails for around $1,900, without all the famous signatures.

President Trump signed a measure this month that allows the federal government to withhold funding from Planned Parenthood and other groups that perform abortions. Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the United States.

Negative approval ratings continue to dog Washington with 62 percent saying they have an unfavorable opinion of Congress. This compares with only 34 percent who give a favorable rating and the harsh opinion is weighing heavily on the Republican majority, especially House Speaker Paul Ryan.

A new poll by Pew Research Center shows the continued dour outlook respondents have about Washington with 24 percent saying they have a very unfavorable view and 38 percent saying they have a mostly unfavorable view of Congress. Meanwhile, only a third (34 percent) say they have a positive view of Congress.

Pew found that majorities of respondents from both parties have had negative feelings about Congress, but perhaps unsurprisingly, Republican feelings have rebounded a bit with the GOP takeover of the majority in the latest review, 44 percent of those leaning Republican have positive feelings about Congress. That is up from 31 percent since last June.

For Democrats, fully 69 percent have an unfavorable view of Congress while the favorable views changed only slightly down to 27 percent from the 32 percent seen last June.

The poll ratings for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan are no better. Pew found that 54 percent disapprove of the job the Speaker is doing. Twenty-nine percent approve while 17 percent had no opinion.

More worrisome for the Wisconsinite is that at 29 percent his ratings are lower than most of the previous Speakers including Republican John Boehner (36 percent), Democrat Nancy Pelosi (35 percent), and Republican Newt Gingrich (34 percent).

While 51 percent of Republicans approve of the job Ryan is doing, 75 percent of Democrats disapprove. But at 31 percent, the number of Republicans who disapprove of Ryan is higher than the number of Republicans who disapproved of either Boehner (19 percent) or Gingrich (23 percent) as those two leaders retired from the position.

Republicans are also vexed by the 53 percent overall who say that the Trump administration is not doing enough to work with the Democrats in Congress while only 36 percent say the administration is doing the right amount of working with the other side. Americans overall feel similarly about Democrat cooperation with 57 percent saying the party is not doing enough to work with Trump while 34 percent say they are doing just about enough.

On a more partisan break down, 64 percent of Republicans say Trump is handling the job of working with Democrats well. As to their own party approach, 52 percent of Democrats say their party’s effort to work with Trump is about right.

Finally, in what might be some bad news for President Trump, most Republicans say that GOP lawmakers don’t necessarily have to back Trump in everything he does. Only 43 percent of Republicans say Republicans have to back the president while 55 percent told Pew that Republicans are not obligated to back every move Trump makes.

The poll was based on telephone interviews between April 5 and 11 of 1,501 adults over 18 and figured at a 95 percent level of confidence.

Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer dismissed the push for President Donald Trump to release his tax returns by his critics, which was also a focus of protests around the country over the weekend.

Krauthammer made the proclamation even though the co-panelists on the “All-Star Panel” segment, The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway and NPR’s Mara Liasson, argued the issue was still important, and Trump should release his tax returns to reveal no potential conflicts of interests.

“Never,” Krauthammer replied when asked by show host Bret Baier if Trump would release his returns. “This issue is dead. It is a dead parrot.”

On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Hardball,” host Chris Matthews wondered if the IRS could state that President Trump isn’t really under audit, and stated that it “would be a good leak” if someone at the IRS leaked that Trump isn’t under audit, because “we know there’s no audit.”

Matthews said, “[W]e know there’s no audit. Can’t the IRS — they claim the — can’t the IRS just make a statement, ‘He’s not under audit’? Just make the announcement. Can’t somebody — by the way, that would be a good leak. Somebody from the IRS just leak it.”

U.S. Border Patrol agents are once again sounding the alarm about miles of border being left wide open and unsecured. Breitbart Texas exclusively obtained a document showing a Havre Sector Border Patrol manager knowingly issuing orders to leave 40 miles of Montana border open and unpatrolled. Obama holdovers in the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency are continuing with the same careless disregard in the Trump Administration that they did under former President Obama, according to Border Patrol agents.

Breitbart Texas has the specific order that was given to the agents signed by the Obama-holdover manager. The order demands that agents on the northern border stay within one assigned zone and are not to leave that zone to patrol other zones that the agents have historically patrolled — even though there are no agents assigned to patrol the other zones. The Havre Sector has six Border Patrol stations and the order applies to one of these stations consisting of six zones. A total of 60 linear miles are covered by the one Border Patrol station in question, yet agents say that this only allows them to patrol 20 of the 60 miles of border.

When Breitbart Texas asked multiple Border Patrol agents about motives for the manager leaving such a vast swath of border unpatrolled, the agents felt that it was twofold; they blamed previous Obama-era policies and they also believed that widespread corruption exists within the Havre Sector’s upper-management.

One of the Border Patrol agents who was present when the manager gave the order spoke to Breitbart Texas on the condition of anonymity and said, “Criminal cartels exploit our weaknesses on a daily basis and they’re certainly going to exploit such a large area of open and unpatrolled border.” Another agent from the station told us on the same condition, “From a border security standpoint, this directive makes no sense, but there has to be a reason so I don’t think it’s a far stretch to conclude it’s due to corruption.” And yet another agent from the station speaking to us on the same condition said, “This order has to be coming from the Sector Chief and Deputy Chief Patrol Agents. They, along with the Station’s Patrol Agent in Charge and Deputy Patrol Agent in Charge, need to be immediately reassigned until a full and thorough investigation can be done into this order.”

Border Patrol Agent Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) was appalled when he heard of this incident from agents — thereby confirming to Breitbart Texas the authenticity of the other agents’ concerns. He told Breitbart Texas that there have been more complaints filed out of the Havre sector than any other sector within recent years. Unfortunately, he says the agency has justified all of the manager’s actions. Agent Judd said anytime you have managers investigating other managers, the result is always “no cause of wrong doing found.”

Agent Judd said there must be accountability from the top down. “I believe Secretary Kelly’s constant praise of former Secretary Jeh Johnson is an endorsement of his open border policies. There are so many good managers in the Border Patrol, but when Secretary Kelly condones his predecessors failures, he opens the door for the bad managers to act like this and bring shame on the entire organization.” Agent Judd continued, “President Trump is the president of the common citizen and the choice of the rank-and-file Border Patrol Agents; unfortunately there are those highly paid career managers who want to believe they’re above everyone else — up to and including the President of the United States.”

Agent Judd said the rank-and-file Border Patrol agents have spoken with the managers at the station in question until they were blue in the face — all to no avail. “Managers who sit behind a desk and never patrol the border should never dictate operations and policy, otherwise this is what you get.”

Multiple Border Patrol agents who were present for the manager’s order to leave 40 miles of border open spoke with Breitbart Texas. They said that all Border Patrol agents who were present argued with the manager and informed him they felt the order was “illegal and was dereliction of duty.” They even argued it was contrary to the President Trump’s express wishes as set forth in the Border Security Executive Order. The agents asked for the rationale behind the order, but the manager refused to provide one, according to them.

Luckily for all of the Border Patrol agents present, a representative of the NBPC who is also an agent walked into the muster room as the order was given, and he wrote the order down verbatim, according to the agents. Not only did he document the order, but the agents claim he read it back to the manager and asked, “did I twist your words?” and the manager responded that he did not. The agent and NBPC representative had all agents present sign the documentation, and he asked the manager to also sign the order, which the manager did.

Breitbart Texas showed the handwritten and signed order we obtained to Agent Judd, and he confirmed that agents were, in fact, given this order. He pointed to the manager’s signature on the order as authentic. We provide the leaked document below. The names have been redacted to avoid any chance of revealing the exact station in the Havre Sector.

Four federal agencies will put many U.S. visa worker programs, including the H-1B white-collar outsourcing program, through a “full legal analysis,” a White House official told reporters Monday night.

The review may wreck several of the many programs which keep a population of perhaps 1.8 million foreign temporary workers in a huge variety of U.S. jobs, even as 4 million young Americans enter the workforce each year.

Those visa programs are now in jeopardy because critics — including attorney John Miano — say the programs lack a firm legal foundation amid a variety of firmly established laws which bar discrimination against U.S. workers.

Moreover, many of the cheap-labor guest-worker programs have been quietly extended and enlarged by prior administrations, ensuring that many may be sharply rolled back if the regulatory extensions are vulnerable to lawsuits, even if the programs are not eliminated.

For example, critics have long argued that there is no legal foundation for President Barck Obama’s decision to provide work permits to several hundred thousand spouses of H-1B white-collar workers, and there is no legal foundation to President George W. Bush’s decision to provide multi-year work permits to foreign students. In 2016, the universities used that student program, dubbed the Optional Practical Training program, to give work permits to at least 147,000 foreign college students and to persuade many other foreign students to enroll in American universities.

In addition, the federal government has repeatedly expanded the H-1B program, and even allows non-profit groups to bring in an unlimited number of foreign students. In 2015, for example, non-profit employers — including many universities and affiliated hospitals — employed roughly 100,000 foreign white-collar workers. Several states are also using that regulation to create non-profits which bring in cheap college graduates for use by employers in Massachusetts and other states.

The multi-program, multi-agency review is being ordered by an Executive Order that President Donald Trump will sign in Wisconsin on Tuesday. The agencies involved are departments of justice, labor, homeland security and state. Much of the focus is on the H-1B program and its regulatory expansions.

According to a report by Politico:

[A White House] official criticized the H-1B system for awarding visas randomly, without taking into account an applicant’s skill or salary level. “The result of that is that workers are often brought in at well below market rates,” the official said. The official emphasized that while each department will need a “full legal analysis” to determine what changes can be made to existing programs, the administration believes there are steps that can be taken both administratively and legislatively. Some potential changes to the H-1B program included weighting the lottery to give an advantage to applicants who hold higher education degrees, for example, or to increase the application fee. “If you change that current system that awards visas randomly, without regard or skill or wage, to a skill-based awarding, it makes it extremely difficult to use the visa to replace or undercut American workers, because you’re not bringing in workers at beneath the market wage,” the official said. “So it’s a very elegant way of solving systemic problems in the H-1B guest worker visa.”

According to TheHill.com,

One senior administration official described “abuse” of the program as any company that “brings in a worker not because you need their skill or talent, but for the purpose of undercutting the American worker” by seeking out cheap foreign labor. The executive order is not expected to address the number of [H-1B] visas that are given out annually. Rather, it is intended to raise the qualifying criteria for applicants so that only top earners with specific skill sets are considered. An administration official claimed that the “lion’s share” of the visas are presently used for “entry-level positions.” “We’ve never had a systematic review like this,” the official said. “These steps are broadly supported by American workers would bring these programs into compliance with their original intent. H1-B was intended to be a skilled worker program but most those using it are paid less than American workers in their field.”

The annual inflow of foreign contract workers is huge, adding up to roughly 1 million short-term or long-term workers, either in white-collar or blue-collar jobs. The imported contract workers are not immigrants, not citizens, nor green card holders, but are temporary workers slated to return home after several years. Generally, employers do not have to interview Americans before hiring foreigners for the U.S.-based jobs.

Many of the contract workers stay for several or more years, ensuring the resident population of white-collar and blue-collar contract workers is much larger than the annual inflow and may reach a resident population of 1.8 million. The left-wing Economic Policy Institute pegs the resident population at 1.4 million.

Many blue-collar workers stay for just one season, filling jobs as landscapers or beach workers, waiters and foresters, fish processors and farm workers. These blue-collar temp programs get a lot of criticism, partly because some employers cheat their foreign workers, but they are supported by many local politicians who are trying to help donors and influential business leaders. This seasonal inflow has sharply reduced the number of Americans teenagers working during the summer.

Most of the white-collar workers stay for several or more years, ensuring the resident population of white-collar contract workers is must larger than the annual inflow. For example, the annual inflow of H-1B white-collar guest-workers is roughly 110,000, but the resident population is almost one million, according to a recent estimate by Goldman Sachs. The federal government releases little data on the many different guest-worker programs, but the available evidence says the national population of white-collar contract workers is up to 1.5 million. That population is roughly twice the population of 800,000 Americans who graduate from college with skilled degrees each year.

Several sites, including here and here, show numbers of H-1B outsourcing visas requested by companies and non-profits. The sites also show where the requested workers will work, their job titles and their supposed wages. For example, the sites show the number of visas for foreign pharmacists sought by CVS and other companies and the number of visas for architects and industrial designers sought by so-called “job shop” firms which outsource their imported workers to other U.S. companies.

The inflow of contract workers forces down wages paid to Americans and to immigrants, partly because the inflow reduces wage pressure on blue-collar and white-collar employers. Moreover, many of the contract workers rationally and decently will take jobs are low wages because their employers can promise to eventually reward them with the massively valuable deferred bonus of a green card and then U.S. citizenship. Each year, companies request and receive 140,000 green cards for their white-collar employees and their families, further boosting the supply of professionals in the white-collar labor market.

Employers say they need the foreign workers because they can’t hire enough Americans for blue-collar jobs, even at wages of $12 per hour or higher.

But critics — and much evidence — say the programs are rife with corruption, including fake resumes, fraudulent visa applications, under-the-table payments, workplace and hiring discrimination against Americans, as well as false claims by lobbyists and corporates that too few Americans want to work at companies such as Goldman Sachs or Facebook or in the New York fashion industry.

A 2016 report by the National Academies of Science showed that cheap-labor gues-workers programs, plus the must large inflow of legal immigrants, annually transfers roughly $500 billion from American employees over to investors and employers.

Many politicians — including House Speaker Paul Ryan — have felt growing pressure from voters, and have reduced their support for the wage-cutting programs since 2016. Other politicians, including GOP Sen. Tom Tillis, have stepped up their support for the labor outsourcing programs along business groups that prefer cheaper labor. For example, GOP House members have recently included a provision in the April 28 appropriations bill that would allow companies to get tens of thousands of additional H-2B visas to bring in more blue-collar workers at salaries rise in a growing economy.

Candidate Donald Trump picked up the flag for Americans in 2016, and his criticism of theH-1B program helped him gain voters from the college-graduate demographic. “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program,” said a Trump statement in 2016. “No exceptions.” In his inauguration speech, Trump declared his national economic policy is: “Buy American, Hire American.”

A professor at Arizona State University allowed students to protest President Trump as a group project effort instead of taking a final exam.

Angeles Maldonado, a professor at ASU, gave her Global Politics of Human Rights class the option of completing a group project or taking a final exam.

Her students opted for the project, and the 20 students in Maldonado’s class decided that their final project would be a protest against President Trump’s policies.

The protest took place Thursday on ASU’s campus in Tempe, Arizona, the Arizona Republic reported.

“The class decided that as a group project they wanted to make their voices heard about the issues that are affecting them today, so instead of just reading about the human-rights violations, they’d speak out about the current violations that are happening,” Maldonado told the Republic, adding that she believed it was her duty as a professor to support their decision.

The students created signs and stood in a line outside ASU’s library to form a human wall.

Students from other classes joined the line and picked up more signs to spell out the slogan, “Wall Against Hate!”

“This was something that we all got together and said we would express some of the things we don’t like, so a lot of the other people here are protesting things like immigration, immigration ban, women’s rights, things like that,” Alex Corella, a student in Maldonado’s class, said.

The issues the protest brought to light included LGBT rights, women’s rights, Black Lives Matter, immigration, and the prison system.

ASU employees asked the students to relocate in order to stop blocking the sidewalk, so the students stood in a staggered line to let people through. This did not placate the staffers, so they sent for campus police.

The students dropped their signs and linked arms as a result.

The police warned Maldonado directly, and the students moved their protest to the lawn to avoid further incident.

The ASU administration released the following statement when asked about the protest:

As an institution of higher education and an environment that promotes academic freedom, Arizona State University supports the free exchange and expression of ideas. All individuals and groups on campus have the right to express their opinions, whatever those opinions may be, as long as they do not violate student code of conduct and student organization policies and do not infringe on another student’s individual rights. This policy applies to all students.

Maldonado has been involved in protests throughout Arizona before. According to her university profile, the Mexican-born professor has participated “in the immigrant rights movement in Arizona” and has “spent many hours organizing protests against Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7f7364a8:19f9bd2:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s recent visit to the White House was of paramount importance to combatting radical Islamic terrorism.

As evidenced by the recent Palm Sunday church bombings by radical Islamists, Egypt finds itself on the front lines in the battle against Islamic radicalism, and more specifically, the Muslim Brotherhood.

It was Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood that started an Islamic revolution in 2011, which created a domino effect, extending into Syria and across the globe.

The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, empowered by the revolution in Egypt, rose to establish an Islamic order in Syria, attempting to eliminate Assad, as their counterpart did to Mubarak in Egypt.

Assad’s loyal ally Russia came to his defense, while our shameful government under President Barack Obama threw Mubarak under the bus.

After President Obama disgracefully endorsed Mohamed Morsi, the MB leader during the Egyptian uprising of 2011, he went even further to destroying an ally in the fight against Islamic extremism when he blocked billions in aid to Egypt after El-Sisi rightfully deposed Morsi in 2014.

Time and time again, our former President stood shoulder to shoulder with Islamic radicals and threw our allies who stood with us in our fight against terrorism under the bus.

Today, President Donald Trump must make it clear to foreign leaders that there is a new sheriff in town, and we will not tolerate those who engage in, or support, Islamic terrorism.

El-Sisi understands the nature of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the threat it poses to both Egypt and the United States.

It was the Muslim Brotherhood that assassinated Anwar Sadat, the former Egyptian president who signed a peace treaty with Israel.

They killed him in cold blood because he was a peacemaker.

Osama Bin Laden, 9/11 ringleader Muhammad Atta, the head of Al-Qaeda Ayman al- Zawahiri, and Islamic State head Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi were all members of the Brotherhood.

The two most powerful countries in the Middle East – Egypt and Saudi Arabia – have designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.

Egypt is the largest Islamic country in the Middle East, with 80 million Muslim, and the most powerful Arabic army.

Saudi Arabia is the most revered Islamic country in the world, not only because of its religious significance, being the home of Islamic Prophet Mohammed, but also because it is a global oil player.

They both understand the existential threat the Brotherhood pose. Yet disgracefully, our government still has not designated this organization as the terrorist entity that it is. A refusal to designate the MB as a terrorist organization leaves us fighting the war on terror with not only an arm tied behind our backs, but blindfolded.

This would be like trying to combat fascism in the 1930’s without naming the Nazis as a target.

How frustrating it must be for allies in the middle east like El-Sisi, whose country has been plagued by the Brotherhood for almost a century, to see such reluctance on the part of the United States to properly identify our enemies.

It is critical for both restoring relations with those willing to fight this enemy with us, that we stop wasting time, and call a spade a spade.

There is simply too much at stake with the Brotherhood running wild.

What makes the Brotherhood particularly dangerous is that, in addition to being the most influential Islamic terrorist organization, it is also the most educated.

Bin Laden was an engineer, and al-Zawahiri a Surgeon, Al-Baghdadi is a Doctor of Philosophy. So we are not dealing with your average rent a jihadist when it comes to the Brotherhood.

In 1982, the Brotherhood wrote a 100-year plan for radical Islam to infiltrate and dominate the West, and establish an Islamic government on the earth. In counter-terrorism circles, it became known as “The Project.” This outlines in crystal clarity, Brotherhood intentions to destroy America from within. They endeavor to do this by infiltrating the media, government, and educational system.

The Brotherhood have already established successful front groups within the U.S, posing as moderate Islamic advocacy groups, such as CAIR and ISNA. This has allowed them access to our elected officials such as President Obama and his cabinet. Consequently, they have influenced public policies that left us vulnerable.

Now is the time to reverse the damage done under Obama’s administration.

The enemy is no longer at our doorstep, but in our house.

We must heed the guidance of President El- Sisi and other middle eastern allies, and designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization once and for all. Every day that passes without such a designation, the tentacles of Islamic terror wrap tighter around us. President Trump, the time is now. For the sake of our country, and protection of Western civilization, please designate this organization as the mothership of jihad that it is.

A frenetic and foul-mouthed Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, withstood several boos from the young crowd at the kickoff of his nationwide tour with socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in Portland, Maine, launching a vitriolic attack on President Donald Trump and the Republican Party on Monday night.

“Those Republican leaders and President Trump don’t give a s**t about the people they were trying to hurt,” a wild-eyed Perez, arms flailing, yelled at the crowd.

Perez criticized Trump for his fiscal year 2018 budget proposal.

“They call it a skinny budget. I call it a s**tty budget because you know what… budgets are moral documents,” Perez exclaimed, oblivious to the disconnect in his use of profanity while speaking of morality and the likely effect it may have among some voters in red states, whom he claims are his intended audience.

“We need to continue to cause good trouble, and that good trouble includes making sure we call out this budget,” he added.

Perez criticized President Trump’s stated desires to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, which he said, “has been a lifesaver, not a job killer.”

“Our strength in our nation lies in our compassion as a nation,” he concluded.

Kristina Rex of WCHS6 captured the crowd’s attitude towards the two men in this tweet:

Crowd goes wild at mention of Bernie Sanders. Some crowd members &apos;boo&apos; at mention of DNC Chair Tom Perez. #NEWSCENTERnow pic.twitter.com/iFX4So1eWp — Kristina Rex (@KristinaRex) April 17, 2017

The hyperactive Perez was followed on stage by the smoother presence of Sanders, who delivered a hardcore socialist message to the largely millennial audience in a grandfatherly manner.

“Our job is to bring millions of people into the political process who, today, do not vote or do not participate in any way,” Sanders began.

“Our job is to radically transform the Democratic Party into a fifty-state party and a party which does not continue to ignore half of the states in our country, including some of the poorest states in America,” he continued.

“Our job is to create a democratic Democrat party, a grassroots party where decisions are made from the bottom on up, not from the top on down,” he added, echoing a theme from his popular but ultimately unsuccessful campaign to secure the Democratic nomination for president in 2016.

“Can you imagine the Republican leadership wanting to give tax breaks to millionaires?” Sanders asked. Then he said Republicans wanted to drop nutrition programs. “What kind of morals do these people have?” Sanders asked rhetorically.

“It is not acceptable to me. It is not acceptable to you that we remain the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care,” he said.

Sanders told the crowd that was why he would soon be introducing legislation calling for a single payer Medicare-style health care system.

“You don’t drain the swamp when you include more billionaires in your cabinet than any president in the history of our country,” Sanders concluded.

A highly energized effort by the Democrats that has raised more than $8.9 million from around the country for thirty-year-old Jon Ossoff has caught the Republican leadership napping .

This puts the young Democrat within striking distance of the 50 percent plus one he needs to win the crowded Sixth Congressional District special election “jungle primary” in Georgia to replace Republican Tom Price, now Secretary of Health and Human Services, outright on Tuesday.

Five polls conducted between April 10 and April 15 give Ossoff between 41 percent and 45 percent of the vote, with the nearest of eleven Republican candidates, former Secretary of State Karen Handel, maxing out at 21 percent.

The Z Politics/Clout Research Poll conducted between April 14 and 15 has Ossoff in first place with 41 percent, followed by Republican Bob Gray at 17 percent in a distant second and Handel at 15 percent in third.

The Emerson College Poll conducted between April 13 and 15 has Ossoff in first place with 43 percent, followed by Handel in second at 17 percent and Gray in third at 15 percent.

“If Ossoff is unable to obtain 50% in the primary on Tuesday he will be forced into a run-off against the candidate who comes in second place. In a series of four hypothetical match-ups, Ossoff trails all his Republican opponents but by a range of 2 to 5 percentage points – all within the poll’s margin of error,” the Emerson College Poll notes.

The WSB/Landmark Communications Poll conducted between April 12 and 13 has Ossoff in first place with 45 percent, followed by Handle in second at 17 percent and several others in single digits.

The Fox 5 Atlanta/Opinion Savvy Poll conducted on April 13 has Ossoff in first place with 42 percent, followed by Handel in second at 21 percent.

The Revily Poll conducted between April 10 and 12 has Ossoff in first place with 45 percent, followed by Handel in second at 17 percent and Gray in third at 16 percent.

The margin of error for the Revily poll is 4.5 percent, which at the top end would put Ossoff less than one percent beneath the majority he needs to avoid a runoff.

Most political experts expect Ossoff to fall just short of the majority he needs for an outright victory.

“Jim Galloway, a longtime political columnist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, told me . . . that he would be ‘mildly surprised, if Ossoff won outright on Tuesday,” The New Yorker’s Charles Bethea reported on Monday.

Still, to have a Democratic candidate in a position where an outright victory on Tuesday would only “mildly surprise” a longtime local political columnist does not speak well for the efforts of the Republican leadership in securing this victory.

As he did in the special election in Kansas’s 4th Congressional District, which Republican Ron Estes won last week in a tighter contest than expected, President Trump weighed in on Monday, this time attacking the Democratic front runner, as NBC News reported:

On Twitter Monday, Trump criticized Jon Ossoff, who is leading a crowded field of candidates in the race to replace former Rep. Tom Price, who stepped down to become the president’s Secretary of Health and Human Services. “The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal [sic] race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!” Trump tweeted. Ossoff responded with a statement, “While I’m glad the President is interested in the race, he is misinformed. I’m focused on bringing fresh leadership, accountability, and bipartisan problem solving to Washington to cut wasteful spending and grow metro Atlanta’s economy into the Silicon Valley of the South.”

On the Republican side, Handel and Bob Gray appear to now be neck and neck in the race to finish in second position tomorrow and earn the right to face Ossoff in a two-person June runoff, according to the most current poll, that done by Z Politics/Clout Research.

“With less than 24 hours until Election Day, a new Z politics and Clout Research poll shows that Republicans may have a new front runner in the race to replace Tom Price,” Z Politics reported.

According to the report, Democrat Jon Ossoff remains the strong favorite ahead of the election, holding on to 41 percent of voter support. Among Republicans, former Johns Creek Councilman Bob Gray now appears to be edging ahead of former Secretary of State Karen Handel. Gray took the lead with 17 percent voter favor, while Handel slightly dipped to 15 percent. Meanwhile, former State Senator Judson Hill is pulling 10 percent support, while former State Senator Dan Moody trails with 9 percent. Businessman David Abroms has 3 percent backing within the District, while former Trump Diversity Coalition leader Bruce Level has 1 percent of the vote. Former State Senator Ron Slotin, the only other prominent-ish Democrat in the running, pulled only 1 percent. While Gray’s numbers have moved ahead of Handel’s, Clout pollster Fritz Wenzel says voter turnout will be key to determining who makes it into a runoff against Jon Ossoff.

“It is simply too close to call which of the Republicans will finish second and get into the runoff with Ossoff,” Wenzel told Z Politics.

“Bob Gray has increased by one point up to 17%, while fellow Republican Karen Handel has decreased by a point, to 15%, but the difference between them is statistically insignificant,” he added.

The strategic error made by the Republican Party has been to fail to identify the threat posed by Ossoff soon enough and to place enough ads to counteract the huge amount of media messages he has purchased in television, radio, and direct mail to define himself positively for the voters.

“Ossoff can afford to blanket local television in part thanks to the millions of dollars that have poured into his campaign from individual donors all over the country,” the New Yorker reported:

Dozens of volunteers from outside the state have also come to Georgia to spread his message. Ossoff recently landed on the cover of New York magazine, which called him “The Trump-Hate Weather Vane,” and stories have also appeared in Time and The Atlantic. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has put ads on Atlanta radio featuring the actor Samuel L. Jackson, a Morehouse alum. (“We have to channel the great vengeance and furious anger we have for this Administration into votes at the ballot box,” Jackson says in the spot.) Meanwhile, the actress Alyssa Milano, currently filming a project in Atlanta, drove Ossoff supporters to vote early during her downtime. The band Imagine Dragons has given the campaign permission to use one of its songs—its drummer, Daniel Platzman, was in Ossoff’s high-school class—though it hasn’t appeared in an ad yet

As for the Republican pushback, there has been some, but the question that will be answered by voters of the Sixth Congressional District tomorrow is this: is it too little too late?</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7f5febd4:1c11a5d:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Eli Stokols writes at the Wall Street Journal that President Donald Trump will sign an Executive order Tuesday embodying major tenets of his Make America Great Again platform that helped launch him to victory in November:

President Donald Trump will sign an executive order in Wisconsin on Tuesday directing a government-wide review aimed at putting new teeth back into decades-old “Buy American” and “Hire American” directives.

The 220-day review process, which could lead to additional executive orders and possibly legislation, will focus on preventing foreign workers with H-1B visas from, as one senior administration official put it, “undercutting American labor at less cost,” which the official labeled as “an abuse” of the current system.

“This is a clear statement from the president of the United States to shore up some of these abuses,” the official continued. The goal, the official said, is ensuring that “everyone can have a realistic path to economic success and full employment.”

For the past several years, the government has used a lottery to distribute 85,000 visas for high-skilled foreign workers. It is a program popular with the technology industry, and one that critics say displaces U.S. workers and can depress salaries.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7f45ef88:1b33037:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump stepped into office amid a groundswell of populism and economic nationalism met with high expectations.

He also faced fierce resistance from a political and financial establishment in Washington, D.C. and Wall Street that had been knocked back on its heels by an election result they failed to foresee.

The president’s trip to Wisconsin will test the strength of that resistance–including resistance from within Trump’s inner circle–as well as the strength of Trump’s resolve to live up to the expectations of his supporters.

“Today we are not transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people,” Trump announced in his inaugural address.

In recent weeks, however, that transfer of power has become harder to discern. The White House’s attention has been focused on events in Syria and North Korea, while the rejection of the bill to repeal and replace Obamacare set off a power struggle within the executive branch. Trump reversed himself on his support for the Export-Import Bank, his evaluation of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, and on the question of whether China is a currency manipulator. A coterie of advisers from New York City, including former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn, has reportedly taken the helm at the White House.

Trump’s travels to Wisconsin on Tuesday present an opportunity for the president to restore a sense of balance–even a sense of mission–to his administration. According to White House officials, Trump plans to tout his call to “buy American and hire American” during a stop at the headquarters of Snap-on Inc, a Wisconsin-based tool manufacturer. Whether the president can still summon the spirit of his fiery campaign speeches may be key indicator of whether or not the man who came to drain the swamp has been drained himself.

Wisconsin is, in many ways, the perfect place for the president to demonstrate his independence from the financiers and long-time GOP stalwarts who appear to have recently gained so much sway over him. Manufacturing jobs are central to the state’s economy, accounting for 16 percent of the workforce. But the state was hard hit by the Great Recession, losing tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs. And although its unemployment rate is still quite low, manufacturing has yet to recover to pre-recession levels. And manufacturing job creation has stalled, barely rising over the past two years.

In other words, this is a state that is far from being “tired of winning.” It could use quite a few more wins on trade and taxes, wins that could restore the good jobs destroyed during the Great Recession. This will be Trump’s first trip to Wisconsin since taking office.

Snap-on was founded in Wisconsin in 1920. Its stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SNA. The company has a market cap of around $9.4 billion, according to data from MarketWatch.

Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan’s 1984 landslide to carry the state. But it is hardly “safe terrain” for the president. He carried the state by a mere 23,000 votes, less than a full percentage point. Already, Wisconsin Democrats have been taking aim at the president, accusing him of being “full of empty promises.”

“We don’t even see the glimmer of an agenda from him,” Martha Laning, chairwoman of the state’s Democratic party, told the Associated Press.

It likely will take more than rhetoric and promises to keep Wisconsin–and by extension, many Americans in areas where the local economy is still suffering from years of misguided or neglectful policies–in the Trump column. Trump will need to unveil concrete pro-jobs policies in Wisconsin if he is going to shine through the muck of the swamp that many fear now clings to his presidency.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7f45ef88:1b33036:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will give a major speech on “Buy American, Hire American” as he signs a new Executive Order at Snap-On Tools in House Speaker Paul Ryan’s district — but Ryan is away on a congressional delegation in Europe… an Administration official telling Breitbart News that their schedules simply “did not mesh on this.”

In 2015, Rep. Paul Ryan held a Congressional listening session at Snap-On, but the now-Speaker of the House won’t be able to make Trump’s trip to the Wisconsin tool manufacturer.

Asked if there was any reason that the event was taking place while Ryan was out of the country, an Administration official told Breitbart News:

There is no reason for that, he is happens to be on a codel. We were trying to coordinate, this was a, this, just, the President’s schedule and the Speaker’s schedule did not mesh on this. I have seen the copy of the text, he’s going to thank the Speaker in the text to make sure that that question isn’t asked, but I am here to tell you it was just scheduling.

Snap-On’s headquarters is located in Kenosha which is also the hometown of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who according to the same official, is expected to be in attendance.

Senior administration officials told reporters on Monday afternoon that Trump’s speech will focus on buying American products and hiring American workers and the erosion of these longstanding policies.

One official went so far as to call “Buy American” the administration’s highest priority when it comes to spending American taxpayer dollars.

Officials drew a clear distinction between “Buy American” and “Hire American”. They also made a distinction between the problems of fraud and abuse in the guest worker system. “Buy American refers to a set of procurement laws about how goods and manufactured parts are obtained and how they’re used if federal projects or federally funded projects and Hire American generally refers to the body of law and policy concerning how our immigration, visa and guest worker programs are operated to ensure proper protections for American workers.”

One official emphasized the great dilution of such policies in the United States and the resulting lost job opportunities for American workers. The official said just the acknowledgment of the problem is remarkable and represents a fairly historic event.

The President’s new Executive Order will “call for the strict enforcement of all laws governing entry into the United States of labor from abroad for the stated purpose of creating higher wages and higher employment rates for workers in the United States.”

Four agencies will be primarily involved on the “Hire American” side: the Department of Labor, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and Department of State. These agencies will be tasked with taking prompt action to crack down on fraud and abuse in the immigration system in order to protect workers in the United States.

The order includes a specific clause for the H1-B visa program that calls on the four agencies to put forward reforms that ensure that visas are awarded to the most skilled or highest paid applicants. One suggestion involved changing the H1-B lottery system, which one official said disadvantages master’s degree holders.

“About 80 percent of H1-B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields,” one official stated.

Some reforms will take place administratively and some will have to be pursued legislatively, one official clarified.

A second official spoke on the Buy American portion of the order, telling reporters that agencies will be held strictly accountable for these policies and will be required to complete top-to-bottom performance reviews including assessments of their use of waivers and exceptions. The official continued, “President Trump has tasked the Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross with revealing all the agency findings and submitting a report to his desk within 220 days. This report and its recommendations will serve as a blueprint for additional executive and regulatory actions to further strengthen Buy American as well as guide possible legislative proposals.”

The official was clear that one objective of the order is to “maximize the use of domestic content and minimize the granting of waivers.” One official stated that waivers may be properly renegotiated or revoked.

The officials said that some free trade agreements have weakened Buy American laws, putting America at a disadvantage. One official stated that agreements will be reviewed to determine whether these agreements meet the standard of being fair and reciprocal for the U.S. The U.S. will reserve the right to renegotiate these deals.

The officials emphasized and produced evidence of bipartisan support for both the Buy American and Hire American objectives. November statistics produced by the Mellman Group showed 60-74 percent support among Clinton voters, Trump voters, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents for requiring all taxpayer-funded construction and manufacturing to use American-made goods whenever possible. Of the 1,200 surveyed in regards to the Hire American portion of the order, 71-79 percent of Clinton voters, Trump voters, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents favored employing “American workers” over “Built by low bidder.”

The U.S. military is sending “dozens” of additional troops to Somalia for training with the Somali National Army and African Union peacekeepers.

One military official told CNN there would be about forty soldiers in the new contingent. A U.S. Africa Command spokesman said a “few dozen” troops from the 101st Airborne Division would be involved. The new deployment will roughly double the number of American special operations forces already supporting the Somali military.

“The objective of this particular train and equip mission is to improve the logistical capacity of the Somali National Army and the focus will be on teaching basic logistics operations, which will allow Somalia forces to better fight al-Shabaab,” spokesman Charles Chuck Prichard said.

Al-Shabaab is the al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group that controls a sizable portion of rural Somalia. On Sunday, al-Shabaab’s most recent ambush in Somalia reportedly killed five Kenyan soldiers and wounded four others, destroying their vehicle with an improvised explosive device.

The attack has been described as retaliation for U.S. airstrikes that supposedly killed over 100 al-Shabaab militants on Saturday, including 20 of their commanders.

President Trump authorized the American military to conduct offensive counterterrorism strikes against al-Shabaab positions in Somalia in March. However, the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) issued a statement describing reports of an airstrike over the weekend as “false,” insisting the American military “did not conduct any kind of kinetic action in that area during the timeframe referenced.”

AFRICOM’s press release highlighted U.S. troops training Somali forces to “better fight al-Shabaab” as a more realistic example of cooperation with the government of Somalia.

This enhanced cooperation was inspired by the election of Somalia’s new president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who declared full-scale war against al-Shabaab, replaced his country’s entire military leadership, and issued a 60-day ultimatum for the militants to surrender on April 6.

“Bomb attacks have become a common occurrence. Because of that, I would like to announce to the Somali people that the country is in a state of war, and the state of the war is not going to be on one front. This war will be a justified one,” declared Mohamed, the day after al-Shabaab killed seven people at the Interior Ministry with a truck bomb.

Skeptics pointed out that Mohamed does not have the military forces to conduct such an all-out war, as Somalia relies heavily on troops from the African Union. Mohamed – who grew up in Buffalo, New York, and is widely known by his nickname “Farmajo,” a play on the Italian word for “cheese” – made rebuilding the Somali military and fighting terrorism a top priority during his campaign. Even some of his supporters and foreign well-wishers thought that was a tall order. More training and air support from the United States would be a big step in the right direction.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7ed0d4e8:1a94e76:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Kellyanne Conway said Democratic Party leaders should put a stop to the violent, anti-Trump demonstrations that happened over the course of the weekend.

In an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, Conway said the protests against President Trump over the weekend, some of them violent, are attempts by liberals to rehash the 2016 election and called upon Democratic leadership to tell the protesters to stop.

“Six months after Donald Trump won 306 electoral votes, you have people still trying to make it go away, and this is the president. This is the people’s house. This is their government,” Conway said. She went on:

I would love to hear the new DNC chairman, Tom Perez, Bernie Sanders, the Democratic senator from Vermont, who are going out on the road starting today, and I would love to hear Hillary Clinton, who lost to Donald Trump handily. I would love to hear them come forward as leaders of the Democratic Party and tell the people to stop. They have a right to express their First Amendment beliefs but at the same time, violence is not going to get us anywhere.

Protesters demonstrated around the country last Saturday on Tax Day, April 15, to demand that the president release his tax returns to the public.

In Berkeley, California, those protests turned violent when anti-Trump protesters clashed with Trump supporters, leading to 21 arrests.

Conway has previously called for Democratic leaders to calm down their supporters who protested against Trump after the 2016 election in November, citing the need for a peaceful transition of power.

Conway also said Democratic leaders should focus on finding common ground with Trump to push a bipartisan agenda forward.

“I would love to hear Democratic leaders of the party, instead of still talking about the election, move forward and help us negotiate,” she said. “Help us get some Democratic votes on tax reform and health care reform and infrastructure.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7e419fd1:19d9a31:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In a preview clip of an interview set to air on Fox News Channel’s Tuesday broadcast of “Fox &amp; Friends,” President Donald Trump said Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were “outplayed” by North Korea.

Trump said, “I don’t want to telegraph what I’m doing or what I’m thinking. I’m not like other administrations, where they say we’re going to do this in four weeks. It doesn’t work that way. We’ll see what happens. I hope things work out well. I hope there’s going to be peace, but they’ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time. You read Clinton’s book and he said, ‘Oh, we made such a great peace deal’ and it was a joke. You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed. They’ve all been outplayed by this gentleman and we’ll see what happens. I just don’t telegraph my moves.”

Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts suggested President Donald Trump’s pro-gun administration is the ‘NRA’s Dream’ but America’s nightmare Sunday, during an appearance MSNBC.

She was especially concerned about the push for “concealed carry reciprocity,” which she described as “extremely dangerous.”

For anyone not familiar with national reciprocity for concealed carry, the goal is to replace the current patchwork of concealed carry laws with a recognition that a concealed permit from one state is valid in every state. This would allow concealed permit holders to drive from one state to the next and keep their handgun with them for self-defense just as they do in their home state. This is what Watts described as “extremely dangerous.”

She said national reciprocity is “the NRA’s dream but it is a nightmare for public safety.” She did not provide any data substantiating her suggestion that concealed carry permit holders endanger public safety.

Watts also mentioned “silencer legislation” and “talk of executive orders to put guns in schools.” She then spoke to the fact that President Trump will be speaking at the NRA’s Annual Meetings on April 28, and said, “I would like to see Donald Trump say something about where he stands on these dangerous laws.”

It is important to note that Trump actually led the charge for national reciprocity during his presidential campaign, so there is no need for him to clarify his stance. On September 18, 2015, Breitbart News quoted Trump:

The right of self-defense doesn’t stop at the end of your driveway. That’s why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states. A driver’s license works in every state, so it’s common sense that a concealed carry permit should work in every state. If we can do that for driving – which is a privilege, not a right – then surely we can do that for concealed carry, which is a right, not a privilege.

Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., also spoke plainly during the campaign when he explained that his father would support firearm suppressor deregulation.

And Trump was very clear in numerous statements about the dangers posed by gun-free zones, like the ones at Orlando Pulse (June 12, 2106), Umpqua Community College (October 1, 2015), and Sandy Hook Elementary (December 14, 2012). In fact, following the Umpqua Community College attack, The Hill quoted Trump saying, “I’ll tell you, if you had a couple of the teachers or someone with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off.”

On April 16, Breitbart News reported Watts’ claim that “caring Americans” support gun control.

U.S. House campaigns on both sides of the political spectrum hit fundraising records in the first quarter of 2017, according to findings from the Federal Election Commission.

Donors gave a record $96.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, a 45 percent increase over the previous record of $66.2 million raised in the same amount of time two years ago, Bloomberg Politics reported.

The maximum contribution amount stayed the same for both periods of time.

Republicans raised $49.8 million, while Democrats raked in $46.3 million.

The reason for this surge in fundraising on both sides can be attributed to President Trump’s first actions as president on immigration, cutting regulation, tax reform, and healthcare reform.

Left-leaning groups have seen a surge in demonstrations and fundraising to fight against Trump’s efforts as president, but conservatives have also seen a boost in fundraising during the first few months of the Trump administration.

“Heightened partisanship is good for fundraising,” said Michael Beckel, manager of research, investigations, and policy at Issue One, a group that advocates limiting the role of money in politics. “Republicans and Democrats are trying to keep their donor bases active at the dawn of the Trump presidency.”

But the biggest surge in fundraising has come from small-dollar donations.

House campaign committees for both parties received a total of $13.7 million in donations from small-dollar donors who gave $200 or less.

President Trump has also benefited from small-dollar donors, who propelled him to victory in 2016 and helped him raise $13.2 million for his 2020 re-election.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7d8514b0:18ab48e:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to call for an investigation into “who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday” – referring to the anti-Trump Tax Day March held Saturday in Washington and at least 60 other locations.

Trump may have missed a Breitbart News exclusive investigative article penned by this reporter on February 16 titled, “Soros Groups Behind Massive Anti-Trump Tax Day Protest Plot.”

While there is no immediate information on who directly bankrolled this specific protest movement, Breitbart News found that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by George Soros or have close links to Soros financing.

Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017

Trump’s tweet itself received widespread news media coverage. However, scores of major news media articles reviewed by this reporter failed to document the Soros ties to the tax march.

“Trump calls for investigation into Tax Day protesters, tweets ‘election is over!’” reads a CNBC.com article.

After noting an initial Trump tweet on the difficulty of a Republican winning the Electoral College, NBC News reported:

The president then followed up by repeating an unsubstantiated claim he’s made before that some of the protesters against him were “paid,” an allegation that became popular in some right-wing circles in the build up to the 2016 presidential election, before noting that the election was “over.”

“Trump’s Tweets Give Tax Day Marchers at Least Part of What They Wanted,” noted the headline in a Vanity Fair report. The article’s sub-headline reads: “He may never release his tax returns, but thousands of marchers around the country got their message heard.”

The website for the Tax Day march claims that its mission is to get Trump to release his tax returns and more.

The site reads:

President Trump needs to be straight with the American people. To whom does he owe favors? Who are his policies really intended to benefit? Who will he put first? Working families are struggling to make ends meet, but we pay our fair share in taxes – does Donald Trump pay any at all?

A query about protest financing sent to the email address for press inquiries listed on the Tax Day March website was not answered as of this writing.

Organizers of the March claim to be “ordinary Americans, community organizers, advocates, and people from all walks of life and all backgrounds joining together to raise our voices and send a bold message to this administration.”

In February, Breitbart News documented a section of the Tax Day March website titled, “Who is organizing it?” The website for the Tax March listed the following eight groups, six of which are either funded by Soros or tied to Soros financing.

The Tax March is grateful to have the support of the following organizations: American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Tax Fairness , Center for Popular Democracy, Indivisible Project, MoveOn.Org, Our Revolution, and The Working Families Party.

Americans for Tax Fairness is the recipient of a grant from Soros’s Open Society Foundations’ U.S. Programs.

MoveOn.Org is financed by Soros.

The American Federation of Teachers’ Educational Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the American Federation of Teachers , was financed by the Strategic Opportunities Fund of Soros’s Open Society Foundations, leaked Open Society documents show.

The Center for Popular Democracy is led by Soros-tied activists . In 2013, Marbre Stahly, a policy advocate at the Center, became a Soros Justice Fellow, which comes with a stipend of $58,700-$110,250 to fund full-time activism projects that last between 12-18 months. The Center was listed as Stahly’s “host” for the grant.

According to her bio , the Center’s research analyst, Maggie Corser, “spent four years at the Open Society Foundations where she conducted research on the future of work, conservative political infrastructure, and a range of economic justice issues.”

Shawn Sebastian, the Center’s field director for its Fed Up Campaign, was a fellow at the so called Anti-Corruption Unit of the Open Society Foundations’ Justice Initiative.

Another Tax March organizer is the recently-formed Indivisible Project. In February, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by Soros.

Leaders of January’s Women’s March coalition reportedly helped to organize the Tax March, which USA Today described as a “sequel” to the massive march. Buzzfeed took note of the comparison to the Women’s March in a piece titled, “Progressives Want Tax Day To Be The Next Women’s March Protest.”

Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of the Women’s March. This journalist first reported on the march leaders’ close associations with Soros.

Since Breitbart’s probe in February, numerous other Soros-financed groups joined the march and are listed as “partners” on the group’s website. The Soros-funded “partners” include Demos and Public Citizen, among others.

Meanwhile, at the protest itself, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) called for Trump to be impeached.

“I don’t respect this president. I don’t trust this president. He’s not working in the best interests of the American people,” complained Waters.

“I will fight every day until he is impeached,” she stated.

President Donald Trump plans to visit Speaker Paul Ryan’s district in Wisconsin on Tuesday, but the Speaker will not join him.

According to a spokesman appearing on Fox 6, Ryan will be traveling in Europe to meet with NATO allies.

Trump is expected to visit the Snap-on tools headquarters in Kenosha, Wisconsin to highlight his pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda. Ryan had visited the Snap-on innovation center in 2015 to host a Congressional listening session.

Ryan won his re-election campaign in the 1st Congressional District of Wisconsin in 2016 with 65 percent of the vote in 2016 after defeating his primary challenger Paul Nehlen with 84 percent of the vote.

Trump won Wisconsin in the 2016 presidential election by about 22,000 votes over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7d8514b0:18ab48c:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Monday at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, President Donald Trump warned North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un to “behave.”

When CNN’s Jim Acosta asked the president if he had any message for North Korea and Kim Jong-un, Trump said, “Gotta behave.”

When Acosta asked if the situation in North Korea can be resolved peacefully Trump said, “Probably it can.”

Harvey Weinstein says he’s putting his money where his mouth is when it comes to fighting President Donald Trump’s political agenda.

In a wide-ranging interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the Hollywood super-producer and Weinstein Company co-chairman revealed he will unveil a private foundation intended to fund causes to combat Trump.

“We’re going to support [everything] from LGBT to women’s rights, more women directors, the National Endowment of the Arts,” Weinstein told THR of the Miriam Foundation, named after his late mother. “I’m going to finance a lot of it privately.”

In an interview before the election with Fox News, the Oscar-winning producer said that if Trump were to win, the country must “come together,” and added that he had nothing against Trump personally. When Trump won, Weinstein said he hoped to see the new president work with former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to forge policy and leave behind the “divisiveness” that has plagued the country.

But when asked by THR about his post-election comments in this week’s interview, Weinstein demurred.

“The less said, the better,” he told the outlet.

Weinstein also revealed that he once had a discussion with legendary director Steven Spielberg about producing the Academy Awards together.

“If we could survive each other, we’d do a great job,” Weinstein said, adding that the current Academy producers are “not using technology properly.” He also joked that he would bring back Warren Beatty — who infamously announced the wrong Best Picture winner at this year’s Academy Awards — to present the same award if he were to produce the show.

Weinstein also briefly discussed his studio’s forthcoming project about the life and death of Trayvon Martin, with co-production by music magnate Jay Z. He said the New York rapper looked at the parents and said: ‘I’m responsible if this is no good. I will do whatever it takes because they’re gonna hold me up on this. I’m not gonna let you down, and I’m not gonna let me down.’ End of conversation.”

On Monday’s Breitbart News Daily, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer discussed President Trump’s appointment of former Alabama Congressman Spencer Bachus to the board of directors for the Export-Import Bank.

SiriusXM host Alex Marlow noted that Bachus, a Republican, holds the unenviable distinction of being the only politician Andrew Breitbart called upon to resign during his lifetime:

LISTEN:

Schweizer recalled that Bachus was chairman of the House Financial Services Committee during the 2008 financial crisis, when he “did a massive amount of option stock trading.”

“The trading was done with inside information that he was getting on briefings,” said Schweizer. “He ended up doing very, very well. Most option stock traders, who are betting that the market’s either going to go up or going to go down, 75 to 80 percent of them don’t make money or they lose money. It’s a very risky investment strategy.”

“Spencer Bachus did extremely well, and here’s why. I’ll just give you one example,” he continued. “September 18, 2008, is sort of a monumental moment in the 2008 financial crisis. That’s when Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary, and the head of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, went to Capitol Hill to meet with a handful of senior congressmen, including Spencer Bachus. It was a secretive meeting, and what they did was, they made all of the congressmen put their phones away in the corner because they didn’t want anybody recording the conversation or texting anybody about it. According to Paulson in his memoirs, he painted an apocalyptic vision of what was coming down the pike. He said, ‘Look, the stock market could lose half of its valuation. We could have a massive failure of banks, et cetera.’”

“That was on the evening of September 18. The morning of September 19, what did Spencer Bachus do, knowing that this apocalypse might be coming down the corner? He shorted the market. He bought $50,000 worth of shares in something called ProShares UltraShort QQQ, which is a leveraged buy, betting that the market would go down. Now, this isn’t much of a bet because he’s been told by the Treasury secretary the night before that this is probably going to happen. And of course, Spencer ended up making a lot of money as a result of this,” said Schweizer.

“When this came out in my book Throw Them All Out, and 60 Minutes did a segment on it, Andrew knew about it before because we had talked and I’d shared the information with him. Andrew was so outraged. He saw this as basically economic treason, that here you have a guy who’s been put in a position of responsibility and leadership to help the country in a crisis like this, and what does the guy do? He takes that inside information, goes out, and tries to make money off of the collapse of the American economy,” Schweizer charged.

He found it “troubling” that President Trump would bring Bachus into the Export-Import Bank, which has been “criticized as an institution for being full of cronyism.”

“Here’s the problem: when you’re a new administration coming in, you’ve got literally thousands of slots that you need to fill, so you’re not going to have the president and his closest aides be able to vet everyone,” Schweizer explained. “You’re going to rely on other people to say, ‘We’ve got to fill this slot at the trade representative’s office, or we’ve got to fill slots at the Export-Import Bank. Who do you recommend?’ They’re going to go to other people, and those other people, unfortunately, are going to pick friends, colleagues, fellow cronies, people who could do them favors to put them in positions of responsibility.”

“I don’t know if President Trump has even met Spencer Bachus. I don’t know if there’s any relationship there, but somebody recommended this guy, and he was basically allowed to take this appointment. I think it’s extremely troubling because it goes to the heart of the very problem that we have in Washington, DC,” he said.

“As you said at the beginning, this is an ecosystem that is rife with corruption and cronyism,” Schweizer told Marlow. “It needs to be beaten back at every instance. A guy like Spencer Bachus – who has not paid a price, so to speak, for his activities, he didn’t seek re-election from Congress after the scandal came out, but he’s never been subject to legal scrutiny – he now has the benefits of this new position. He hasn’t paid a price for what he did.”

Marlow turned to a recent New York magazine article called “The Case for Kleptocracy,” which he described as “a very dark column” that posits “the alternatives for President Trump at this point in time appear to be Bannonism – or populism meets nationalism meets conservatism – or it’s going to be some sort of family-style corporatism where he’s favoring his own business interests and using the bully pulpit to do so.”

“We’re going to have to wait and see,” Schweizer responded. “As I’ve said from the beginning, Alex, this administration has huge potential to deal with cronyism and corruption. You have a man who ran for president on that platform. You have a man in the White House now who is not beholden to the financial interests the way that other candidates are. He didn’t go out and raise a ton of money from Wall Street or from trial lawyers. They went to his opponents. So he’s in a unique position.”

“The question is: ‘What is he going to do with that authority?’” he asked. “I think there are troubling signs that you’re seeing business as usual with some of these appointees, and there exists a very real potential that the Trump family members – meaning the sons or Jared Kushner, the son-in-law, or Ivanka – are going to be offered sweetheart deals. This goes on with every administration. The question is, are they going to have the fortitude not to take them?”

“Those are the two things we need to be looking for: are there actions being taken to drain the swamp? It’s still early in the administration, but we’ve got to watch closely. And second of all, are there sweetheart deals that are being offered to family members to curry favor and to procure corrupt deals? We’ve got to make sure that those things don’t happen. This is really, I think, the reason that Trump was elected, more than any other,” he said.

Marlow cited a Washington Post article that argued that the Trump children are “interested in any changes that might help resuscitate the presidency and preserve the family’s name at a time when they are trying to expand the Trump Organization’s portfolio of hotels.” The Post further argued that the family is concerned with the both the commercial and political value of the Trump brand, knowing that President Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign will be very different from his 2016 campaign.

“There’s a fundamental question and option that the Trump family is looking at right now,” Schweizer observed. “Number one, do they want to do what the American people elected President Trump to do, which is to bring fundamental change in Washington? Or number two, do they want to build another brand, like Jay-Z and Beyonce? Those are really the options.”

“You’re not going to be able to do both. You’re not going to be able to straddle both,” he argued. “I’m somebody who loves American history, who loves the country, and if you presented me with that option – who cares if you build some new brand that brings some changes to the fashion industry, when you have a unique opportunity to bring fundamental change to the country that so many people are looking for? It’s a binary choice. They’re not going to be able to do both.”

“Really, I think the question rests with the president, ultimately. His kids may have a different vision, but he is the one that’s elected. Let’s hope that he makes choices that are designed to root out cronyism and corruption, not choices that are designed to build the family brand,” he said.

Marlow concluded by asking Schweizer for his thoughts on the Trump White House sealing its visitor logs.

“I think it’s been exaggerated in the past how important the White House visitor logs are,” Schweizer replied. “There are numerous stories in the Obama administration; if they wanted to meet with somebody that was sensitive they’d just go to the coffee shop across the street, meaning that they wouldn’t have to disclose who they were meeting with.”

“But I will say as a researcher who works in this area, I have found those logs to be enormously helpful,” he added. “It begs the question: ‘Why are you closing down these logs?’ It raises the question: ‘Are you trying to hide something?’”

“The argument that this is being done for security reasons just does not wash with me,” said Schweizer. “If you’re fearing [a] terrorist attack, them being able to have a list – they’re not going to have names in advance of who you’re meeting with. It’s a log of previous meetings. So the notion that somehow this creates a security problem, I’m just not buying. I think it raises that question of: ‘Why are they doing this?’ The fear is that they’re trying to hide these kinds of activities we’ve been talking about.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump and their son Barron greeted participants at the 139th annual White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday as Attorney General Jeff Sessions read a bunny story to a group of children.

Waves of little ones lined up to take their turn at racing their eggs to the finish line with the prodding of their wooden spoons. Hundreds came forward to make their dashes. The festivities went on through the morning despite spurts of rainfall.

President Trump greeted the crowd after some fanfare from the Marine Corps Band and the National Anthem. He thanked all in attendance, saying “We will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before and we are right on track… Thank you, everybody, for coming.”

“We’re going to do cards for soldiers. Melania and Barron and myself are going to sign some cards for some great troops… We’re going to come out and join you… for a great Easter egg roll,” the president continued. “I’ve seen those kids and they’re highly, highly competitive.”

President Trump thanked the First Lady for her diligent work on the event, “She’s been working on this for a long time to make it perfect… I want to congratulate her on this wonderful, wonderful day.”

First Lady Melania Trump then addressed the crowd, “First time my husband and I are hosting this wonderful tradition. It’s great that all of you are here with us today. I want to thank the military band, staff and all the volunteers who worked tirelessly to make sure you enjoy the activities.” She gave great thanks to the military, “all around the world who are keeping us safe.”

The President, First Lady and their son Barron walked down to a craft table to spend some time with the children. President Trump spoke with the children for a bit after which he stood up, thanked those gathered, and took his leave with his wife and son.

Near the end of the race finish line, Attorney General Sessions and the First Lady took their turns reading books to some of the kids. Sessions read a story about a bunny that was briefly interrupted for the address from the President and First Lady, but resumed quickly thereafter. First Lady Melania read Kathie Lee Gifford’s children’s book entitled “Party Animals”. Gifford’s book tells the story of a goose who finds fault with everyone she can think of to invite to her birthday party, but after seeking counsel from an owl, decides to invite everyone, differences and all.

Just after the First Lady finished her reading the rain returned and many took their leave from the festivities.

Sunday on “Fox &amp; Friends Weekend,” former UFC Fighter Tim Kennedy said he decided to re-enlist in the U.S. Army Special Forces after noticing the change in leadership under new President Donald Trump following eight years with Barack Obama.

Kennedy was inspired by the MOAB dropped in Afghanistan last week.

“I’ve got hope again,” he said of Trump being commander-in-chief. “The military, we got our teeth back.”

Kennedy added that the U.S. now has a “reinvigorated, hopeful, beautiful military.”

“I’ve got people that will back me now,” he explained.

Dear isis, If you are lucky enough to kill a Special Forces operator, the possibility of us dropping the biggest non-nuclear bomb ever made on you should be the least of your concerns. There is a vengeance and wrath associated with the loss of one of our brothers. May God have mercy on your soul because we are coming and we will have none to give. Sincerely, The U.S. Military A post shared by Tim Kennedy (@timkennedymma) on Apr 14, 2017 at 12:34pm PDT

A bride and groom headed to Costa Rica for their wedding got kicked off a United flight set to leave Texas on Saturday afternoon.

The couple, along with their friends, was flying from Salt Lake City and stopped for a layover in Houston, where they were scheduled to board United Airlines Flight 1737 headed from Houston (IAH) to Liberia, Costa Rica (LIR), KHOU reported.

Michael Hohl said he and his fiancée, Amber, were the last to board the plane when they noticed a man spread out across their entire assigned row napping.

Hohl said they decided not to wake the man and instead sit three rows up from their assigned seats. He said they did not think it would matter because the flight had multiple empty rows.

“We thought not a big deal, it’s not like we are trying to jump up into a first-class seat,” said Hohl.“We were simply in an economy row a few rows above our economy seat.”

Once they sat down, a flight attendant approached them and asked if they were in their ticketed seats. The couple said they were not and asked if they could get an upgrade instead.

The flight attendant reportedly told the couple that they needed to return to their assigned seats.

Hohl said after they complied with the flight attendant’s order, a U.S. Marshal came onto the plane and asked them to disembark.

The couple cooperated and left the plane, but they are baffled as to why they were asked to leave in the first place.

“They said that we were being disorderly and a hazard to the rest of the flight, to the safety of the other customers,” said Hohl.

United Airlines claims the couple “repeatedly” tried to sit in an upgraded seat without paying for it and that the couple failed to “follow crew instructions.”

The couple rebooked their flight for the next morning, but Hohl said they will not be flying United again after their experience.

“I think customer service and the airlines has gone real downhill,” said Hohl. “The way United Airlines handled this was really absurd.”

The couple’s wedding is still planned for Thursday.

United Airlines has made headlines recently after a video showing a doctor violently dragged off a flight by authorities for refusing to give up his seat went viral.

The video generated so much outrage, President Trump denounced the incident, numerous celebrities slammed United Airlines on social media, and nearly 20,000 individuals signed a petition asking United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz to resign as a result.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7ce8b151:1869b2b:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Times of Israel reports: Palestinian official said Sunday that the much-touted first meeting between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and US President Donald Trump will take place on May 3 in the White House.

Senior Fatah official Azzam al-Ahmad also told the Jordanian newspaper Al Ghad that a Palestinian delegation will head to Washington on April 23 for preliminary meetings with the administration. There was no immediate confirmation of the date from the White House or the Palestinian Authority.

“President Abbas will go to discuss the vital political and economic issue, with an emphasis on confirming the two-state solution, completely ending settlement construction and the occupation, and establishing a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with occupied Jerusalem as its capital,” al-Ahmad said.

Leading into a Sunday MSNBC “AM Joy” debate, host Joy Reid said that North Korea testing its missiles only raises more tension now that there is an “unpredictable” president in the White House, referring to President Donald Trump.

“For 20 years now, a defiant North Korea has been testing its missiles, firing them into the heart of frenzied diplomatic tensions as the world holds its collective breath. The only difference now, there’s a new and unpredictable commander-in-chief in the White House,” Reid stated.

Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” former CBS “Evening News” anchor Dan Rather said it was “too early” to declare President Donald Trump as presidential for dropping bombs.

Rather said, “Dropping bombs, having missile strikes doesn’t make one presidential. There’s an old story here and I among others have much to answer for in the press that just because the president exerts himself as commander in chief, there’s a natural inclination and an unhealthy one to say, ‘boy, that makes him presidential or strong.’ It’s easy to drop bombs and easy to put missiles off. What comes after that, dealing with what comes in the wake of that is much more difficult. So, yes, I was critical of those and raised the question of those who said this makes Trump presidential.”

“I gently and hope respectfully disagree with that,” he continued. “What makes one presidential is can you keep the peace. Now if it turns out that’s theses actions keep the peace we can say well that a good move but it’s way too early to say that. We are in danger here. There’s a lot of things, North Korea, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, South China Sea. These are real powder kegs with a fairly short fuse burning. Before we make decisions on being, quote, presidential, we need to see how it plays out.”

This is the first time the president’s overall approval rating has been back in the 50s in nearly a month. Just after his inauguration, Trump’s job approval peaked at 59% and remained in the 50s every day until early March. It’s gone as low as 42% since then.

Trump’s ratings have improved despite multiple reports of staff infighting in the White House and after his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump also approved a missile attack in response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons, and the military dropping the “Mother of All Bombs” on Islamic State terrorists in Afghanistan.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7c7328cc:15bedc5:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump returned to his attacks on the biased media, after a weekend away from Washington D.C.

“The Fake Media (not Real Media) has gotten even worse since the election,” he wrote on Twitter. “Every story is badly slanted. We have to hold them to the truth!”

Last week, some in the media were surprised after Trump referred to them as “very honorable people” during an event at the White House.

Trump appeared to be watching Fox and Friends on Monday morning, praising the show for some of their analysis.

“’The first 90 days of my presidency has exposed the total failure of the last eight years of foreign policy!’” he wrote. “So true.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7c7328cc:15bedc4:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

California Democrats are readying themselves to battle Republicans in Congress over potential attempts to roll back regulations under the Endangered Species Act.

Last month, the Oroville Dam’s spillway malfunctioned, sending gallons of water rushing through an area affecting nearly 200,000 residents. The damage — beyond the spillway itself — is estimated to be in the millions.

However, certain U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulations under the Act, which protects endangered species like the 3-inch Delta smelt, and which require property owners to consult with the agency before carrying out construction or repairs, could present roadblocks to fixing the damages.

According to the San Bernardino Sun, “Section 7 consultations” specifically allow wildlife agencies to determine how projects are carried out in order to prevent harm to protected species.

Last month, congressional Republicans took aim at the Endangered Species Act because it could prevent necessary projects from taking place — and also, possibly, because of longstanding grievances over the diversion of water from farms to the Delta smelt because of the Act.

California Democrats are now pushing back with a state bill that would prevent federal changes from affecting the protection of endangered wildlife at the state level.

The California Environmental, Public Health, and Workers Defense Act of 2017, introduced in December by Democratic state Senators Kevin De León (D-Los Angeles) and Henry Stern (D-Canoga Park), would require the Golden State to implement environmental laws that are equal to or even more stringent than regulations set into law under federal environmental laws.

According to the San Bernardino Sun, the bill, SB 54, seeks to ensure that California maintains and strengthens protections for air, water and endangered species, including for worker safety laws.

“This is the least we can do to protect our state,” Sen. Stern reportedly said before the Senate Environmental Quality Committee on April 5, the San Bernardino Sun notes. The committee reportedly voted 5-2 to move the bill forward.

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for the coming fiscal year would reportedly trim $1.5 billion, or 12 percent, from the Interior Department’s budget, which could directly affect the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — a move that has some California environmentalists concerned.

However, others have argued that existing state and federal regulations already go too far.

Some who support the Democratic bill reportedly contend that the Endangered Species Act is in need of reforms that would provide farmers and other property owners with incentives to protect wildlife.

The bill’s next stop will be at the State Senate’s Judiciary Committee.

Several members from the 2016-2017 Super Bowl winning New England Patriots are boycotting the team’s April 19 trip to the White House to celebrate their season with President Donald Trump.

Chris Long, Martellus Bennett, Devin McCourty, Alan Branch and LeGarrette Blount all announced they would forgo the tradition due to the man currently in office. Dont’a Hightower also announced he would not go, but reasoned that he had gone previously with the University of Alabama and with the Patriots so he did not want to go again.

Friday, McCourty and Long appeared in a video titled “StandingPats: (Be Patriots)” along with fans to discuss their opposition to Trump.

Long says in the video, “When my son grows up, and I believe the legacy of our president is going to be what it is, I don’t want him to say, ‘Hey dad. Why did you go when you knew it was wrong?&apos;”

One fan says he was tired of the Patriots being labeled “alt-Right,” which McCourty proposes they “switch the narrative.”

The video concludes with each fan, McCourty and Long saying, “Be Patriots.”

In a White House marked by infighting, top economic aide Gary Cohn, a Democrat and former Goldman Sachs banker, is muscling aside some of President Donald Trump’s hard-right advisers to push more moderate, business-friendly economic policies.

Cohn, 56, did not work on Republican Trump’s campaign and only got to know him after the November election, but he has emerged as one of the administration’s most powerful players in an ascent that rankles conservatives.

Trump refers to his director of the National Economic Council (NEC), as “one of my geniuses,” according to one source close to Cohn.

More than half a dozen sources on Wall Street and in the White House said Cohn has gained the upper hand over Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, the former head of the right-wing website Breitbart News and a champion of protectionist trade opposed by moderate Republicans and many big companies.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b79d5df08:13bdc71:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” during the panel discussion about the news that the White House will not release visitor logs and President Donald Trump not release his tax returns, host Chris Wallace declared that Trump “thinks transparency is overrated.”

“There was another change this week by this president, not a change in his policy, but from the previous presidents,” Wallace said. “He now says that this White House is no longer going to routinely release visitor logs showing who’s coming to the White House, who they’re meeting with, as President Obama did. And another interesting development this weekend, there were massive marches across the country, people protesting. These were called tax marches. People demanding that President Trump releases his tax returns as presidents have routinely since Jimmy Carter. And that was the subject of a tweet this morning from President Trump. Let’s put it up on the screen. The president apparently not liking those marches. He says, “I did what was an almost impossible thing to do for a Republican, easily won the electrical college. Now tax returns are brought up again? Gillian, this president apparently thinks transparency is overrated.”

Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” during a discussion about the perceived policy changes between President Donald Trump’s campaign and administration, former CBS “Evening News” anchor Dan Rather likened Trump to a frog “jumping around” in a hot skillet.

Rather said, “In terms of policy, including foreign policy, President Trump has been jumping around like a frog in a hot skillet. He’s reversed himself on any number of things. He questioned NATO and now he’s all in favor of NATO. He said the U.S. military is a disaster during the campaign now he’s for the military. He questioned the Federal Reserve, now he is maybe reappointing the head of the Federal Reserve. There’s a long list of these things. Chinese currency, first he said China is a currency manipulator. Now he says they aren’t currency manipulators. There’s a lot going on behind the scenes. This business of jumping around from place to place. Being unpredictable is sometimes helpful for a leader. But, if you are this unpredictable, you run the risk of running a dysfunctional presidency. That’s what Donald Trump is battling at the moment.”

Come with me… if you want congressional districts to be drawn fairly.

Arnold Schwarzenegger has launched a nationwide anti-gerrymandering campaign that aims to place Congressional re-districting in the hands of independent, unbiased commissions.

In a post to his Facebook page this week, the 69-year-old actor and former California governor promised to match any donations made to his new fundraising campaign, which is aimed at fixing what he calls a “broken” system of drawing district lines in which representatives with approval ratings worse than “herpes, colonoscopies and cockroaches” continually get re-elected.

“At the same time, it seems like the American people are more divided than at any time in recent memory,” Schwarzenegger wrote. “That’s no accident – our politicians have literally divided us, drawing map lines so that they can pick the voters they want to represent, instead of letting the voters pick them.”

“When I was elected Governor of California in 2003 a lot of voters imagined I would be the Kindergarten Cop and break the gridlock in the legislature singlehandedly, but I realized very quickly that the problem ran much deeper,” he added. “Because legislators were drawing their own districts, they were picking their voters and virtually assuring their own re-election. Most politicians came from hardcore Democratic districts or hardcore Republican districts and had no incentive to leave their partisan corners to come together for the people of California.”

Schwarzenegger went on to explain that California’s adoption of an independent commission to draw congressional districts nearly ten years ago resulted in four House seats changing party hands in the 2008 election, what he said was a 400 percent increase from the past decade in just one year.

“It’s a three-pronged attack – we will fight gerrymandering with grassroots initiatives, we will fight it by lobbying in state capitols, and we will fight it in the courts,” Schwarzenegger wrote. “Together, we will win.”

As of Sunday afternoon, the “Terminate Gerrymandering” fundraising page on CrowdPac had raised more than $15,000.

Schwarzenegger has been both politically active and gone back to his acting roots in recent months.

In addition to feuding openly with President Donald Trump, the former governor hosted a reboot of Trump’s popular Apprentice reality show, before announcing earlier this year he would not return for a second season.

Earlier this month, Schwarzenegger told Entertainment Weekly that he hoped to begin shooting a sequel to his 1988 comedy Twins — tentatively titled Triplets — later this year.

On this weekend’s broadcast of “Sunday Morning Futures” on the Fox News Channel, President Donald Trump’s deputy assistant Dr. Sebastian Gorka said Trump was “not an interventionist commander-in-chief.”

Gorka said, “I would like to make one thing very clear because there’s been a lot of missed reporting on this. The president is not an interventionist commander-in-chief. nothing has changed from November 7th 2 today. He’s been explicit. We are not invading other people’s countries. This isn’t some neoconservative Bush-era administration. Nevertheless, we have obligations to our friends in the region and on top of that, things like weapons of mass distraction, nuclear weapons in the hands of rogue regimes, chemical weapons, those will not be countenanced because they are a threat to Americans as well and that is why you see the leadership out of the White House you are seen.”

President Donald Trump and his family went to church on Easter Sunday, attending services at the Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida.

The President and the First Lady were joined by their daughter Tiffany, their son Barron, and Melania Trump’s parents, according to the White House. Donald Trump Jr. and his family were also spotted going into the church.

The presidential motorcade passed two children that held signs that said “Happy Easter Mr. President,” according to the White House pool report.

According to the White House, the Trumps planned a family brunch and an Easter egg hunt at Mar-a-lago during the afternoon.

The Department of Justice should keep the public informed about the results of former President Barack Obama’s decision to grant early releases to 1,715 convicts, says a former federal prosecutor.

“What [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions Justice Department needs to do now is track the hundreds of fellows who got these pardons and commutations,” said former federal prosecutor Bill Otis. “With overall recidivism rates for drug offenses already being 77 percent, I think we have a pretty good idea, but [the public] should get specifics: How many of these guys re-offend; what’s the nature of the new crime; were there related violent crimes in the mix as well; and how many victims (including but not limited to addicts and overdose victims) were there?”

But only the Department of Justice has the manpower and access to raw data needed to detail and analyze Obama’s last-minute, closed-door process which released a record 1,715 convicts back into Americans’ neighborhoods. At least one other group has tried to gauge the impact of President George W. Bush’s pardons—but that group had to hire three researchers to assemble only some of the data that the federal government has at its fingertips but does not share.

Since January, President Donald Trump has already taken some steps to increase federal transparency by forcing agencies to release data about crime by illegal aliens. For Otis, this change is a good example of what officials should do with information about Obama’s commutations.

“It may be helpful to have some kind of interagency standard or oversight body to ensure the public has reasonable access to the data it paid for,” consistent with privacy rules, said Jason Richwine, a public policy expert who studies government data to gauge the impact of policy alternatives. “When the government publishes [only] selected statistics from the restricted data, we get answers only to the questions that the government thinks are important—not necessarily the same questions that the public wants (or needs) to be answered,” he said.

“It’s almost always a good idea for the feds to be more transparent,” said Otis. “The sheer size of the federal government makes it hard for citizens to know what’s going on,” Otis wrote, adding:

The feds should also be, not just more transparent, but quicker to release crime data. Because the present release procedures are so slow, liberals were able to deny for many months—if not close to a year—the crime spike that began at the end of 2014, and to dismiss it as just ‘scattered reports’ or ‘a bunch of scaremonger anecdotes.

In January, as he was preparing to leave the White House, Obama claimed “there is no growing crime wave,” despite the crime wave that has killed an extra 1,500 Americans in 2015 and 2016.

Sheltered by the embargo on government data that could have debunked his denial, Obama used his pardon power to shorten sentences for 1,715 criminals, including traffickers of deadly drugs.

Many of those who received clemency are also violent felons. For example, Obama commuted the sentence of a previously-convicted drug trafficker sentenced for involvement in his mother-in-law’s shooting death—and Sherman Ray Meirovitz will be back on the streets in June instead of serving out a life sentence. Obama freed a former armed cocaine dealer onto Virginia’s streets in March, along with a former armed Philadelphia crack cocaine dealer, plus a former armed California meth trafficker.

Obama also justified his large-scale release by claiming racial disparities in the criminal justice system. “About one in every 35 African American men, one in every 88 Latino men is serving time right now. Among white men, that number is one in 214,” Obama said in a 2015 NAACP speech. He continued:

For nonviolent drug crimes, we need to lower long mandatory minimum sentences—or get rid of them entirely. Give judges some discretion around nonviolent crimes so that, potentially, we can steer a young person who has made a mistake in a better direction. We should pass a sentencing reform bill through Congress this year. We need to ask prosecutors to use their discretion to seek the best punishment, the one that’s going to be most effective, instead of just the longest punishment. We should invest in alternatives to prison, like drug courts and treatment and probation programs.

Obama’s White House stated that 60 percent of those incarcerated in federal prison were black or Latino but declined to reveal critical details.

The race-based claim deeply shaped Congress’s debate over crime in 2015 and 2016, when Obama and his deputies tried to pass the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 (SCRA), which would have slashed mandatory minimums for drug traffickers.

The bill’s language, however, reached far beyond the small number of people convicted solely on drug offenses. Sessions, who is now the U.S. Attorney General, noted in May 2016 that there are “virtually no cases of simple possession” in the federal courts. Nearly all, or 99.5 percent, of those incarcerated in federal prison for so-called “nonviolent drug crimes” are convicted on trafficking charges. The bill stalled in the Senate as a handful of Republican senators, including Arkansas’ Tom Cotton and Florida’s Marco Rubio, publicly opposed the legislation, and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump campaigned on a platform promising “law and order.”

Defeated by data, Obama sought another path to reducing the federal prison population.

“As was so often the case, Obama simply took the law into his own hands. Had Congress thought its prior drug laws were too stringent, it could have, by legislation, given retroactive effect to any lighter sentences it wanted,” Otis explained. “But it didn’t—the push for sentencing ‘reform’ fizzled. Frustrated with Congress’s refusal to adopt even more of his pro-criminal agenda, Obama just acted unilaterally.”

Now that Obama has provided clemency to 1,715 prisoners, his actions will have long-standing ramifications, Otis warned:

I think there are two long-term effects of Obama’s mass clemencies. One is to send the message that we’re just not that serious anymore in dealing with drug traffickers, and that we think the real problem is that American is too callous and punitive (and racist?)—not that drug dealers are too unfeeling towards the lives they damage while trying to make a quick buck… The other long-term effect will be simply to exacerbate the heroin overdose crisis that’s been escalating for at least a decade. Why we become lenient toward drug dealers at exactly the moment the dangers of drugs have reached a shocking level is a mystery wrapped in an enigma.

Obama undertook his criminal-leniency campaign at a time when over 47,000 Americans died from drug overdose deaths in 2014, including 28,647 from opioid overdoses, and heroin-induced overdose deaths tripled between 2010 and 2015. The CDC found over that a staggering 500,000 people died from drug overdoses from 2000 to 2014.

It is difficult to track criminals who received commutations, especially when the government is reluctant to share or even collect important statistics, as several experts explained to Breitbart News.

Without clear and detailed government data, activists and critics of government policies must rely on outside surveys, indirect or second-hand data, often decorated by anecdotes.

A Justice Department investigation into the makeup of the commutations would need to compare the makeup of the commuted population, versus the current prison population, versus the general population. Unfortunately, much of the needed data is not collected and the existing statistics sometimes raise more questions than they answer.

For example, the Uniform Crime Reports, a compilation of street crime reports collected from 18,000 different sources published annually by the FBI, has five race categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. “White” in the UCR’s case includes all Latinos—and the Latino population in the U.S. stood at roughly 57 million in 2015. Blurring racial and ethnic categories makes obtaining a complete picture difficult.

Since nearly all of the heroin used in the U.S. is brought across the border by Mexican traffickers, who are nearly always illegal aliens, there is an immigration angle to Obama’s sentence commutations as well, made more opaque by the “muddled” data collected by the feds.

For example, a report by the CATO Institute recently claimed that Trump’s new VOICE program was unwarranted because immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than similar Americans. “Our headline finding is that both illegal immigrants and legal immigrants have incarceration rates far below those of native-born Americans—at 0.85 percent, 0.47 percent, and 1.53 percent, respectively,” claimed author Alex Nowrasteh.

However, the study, titled “Criminal Immigrants: Their Numbers, Demographics, and Countries of Origin,” relies on extrapolations from the American Community Survey, not on actual data from the Department of Justice. That lack of DOJ data skews the CATO report because it cannot measure how many migrants were sent home before they could re-offend like many American criminals who stay in the country to commit more crimes. That immigrant vs. American comparison problem might be reduced if the federal government released data showing the share of foreign-born criminals in jail under first-time offenses. But, said author Alex Nowrasteh, “that data is not in the ACS/Census… If you have it, please share it.”

The group ProPublica tried to study the patterns in the pardons (not commutations) approved by President George W. Bush. The group recognized the lack of DOJ data and launched an enormous undertaking by at least two authors and three researchers, and extensive data analysis, to show that 494 requests for pardons were submitted, but only 189 were partly or fully approved. Of those 189 pardons, many were for white-collar crimes, while only a small proportion was for drug offenses.

“Accounting for the effects of these variables did not eliminate the strong influence of race on getting a pardon [and] [a]fter testing all available variables, we found that whites were still nearly four times as likely to be pardoned as minorities overall,” said the 2011 report, which explains the complexities caused by the lack of public federal data.

President Bush relied almost exclusively on recommendations from the Office of the Pardon Attorney inside the Justice Department. The data thus provide an opportunity to assess the office’s impact on final pardon decisions. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, ProPublica obtained the names of petitioners who were denied pardons during Bush’s two terms—1,729 individuals. The names of 189 petitioners who received pardons came from the pardon office website. ProPublica pulled a random sample of 500 names from the combined list… For all those in the sample, ProPublica staff and freelance researchers searched public records or made phone contacts to gather demographic data such as age, race, gender and marital status. Researchers gathered sentencing information from federal court records and FOIA requests, and searched other records to collect data on bankruptcies, liens, financial judgments and any additional criminal history… We conducted a binary logistic regression. The dependent variable was whether the petitioner received a pardon. We tested all other available variables against the outcome. In the end, variables that we included in the analysis were: race;

number of years from sentencing to petition;

offense;

sentence;

gender;

marital status;

whether the petitioner had a bankruptcy;

whether the petitioner had a lien or judgment filed against him or her;

whether the crime was committed while the petitioner was in the military;

whether an elected official sent a letter to the pardon attorney on the petitioner’s behalf… … Hispanic petitioners are classified as white in most federal court and prison records. To identify Hispanics in our sample, we relied on Hispanic surname or race as designated in other public records…

The government’s habit of hoarding original data complicates many policy debates, said experts.

When the government shares its data, the public can understand existing patterns and data, crime expert Heather McDonald told Breitbart News. For example, she said:

[In] New York City blacks make up 53 percent of all New York police department pedestrian stops, but blacks are only 23 percent of the city’s population. To a naïve observer, that disparity in police activity looks like racism. What you need to know is that blacks commit 75 percent of all shootings in New York City and 70 percent of all robberies. By contrast, whites are 34 percent of the population but they commit less than two percent of all shootings and less than four percent of all robberies. Whites make up nine percent of all police pedestrian stops. So blacks are actually under stopped compared to what their crime rates would predict and whites are over stopped compared to what their crime rates would predict.

The extra knowledge can help resolve public debates, such as the controversy over race and arrests rates, she explained.

“The big fallacy of all anti-cop activism is to ignore the fact that policing today is data-driven and police go where people are most being victimized and that is in minority neighborhoods. But the public is, by and large, clueless about how vast the disparities in criminal offending are,” she said. “The federal government could take the lead in educating the public about policing and crime.”

On immigration issues, the federal government hides data about the scale of guest-worker programs, such as the H-1B program, and it hides data about green card holders, said Steven Camarota, research director at the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). Similarly, the federal government has muddled data regarding repatriations, he said, adding: “This is how the Obama administration made [the number of] deportations look higher.”

The federal government does have data from the states about the number of illegal aliens in U.S. jails, but it only releases data about the annual number of hours spent by all illegal alien prisoners, he continued. The data about cumulative hours is released via federal reports about federal funding for state jails that house illegal aliens.

“It is not enough to know that Arizona says they had a million hours of aliens in prison in the last year,” he told Breitbart News. “You want to know what that is a percentage of the total” number of hours and prisoners, he said. Without the so-called “microcode’ data, he said, “we can’t do our own analysis.”

“I would like to know all the different categories of people among those arrested,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the CIS. “How many have protected status? How many have green cards?” she asked. “They won’t even tell us how many are non-citizens,” she said, adding: “I know they can do a breakdown because I’ve seen it in the past.”

The Department of Homeland Security should reveal far more of the data is keeps secret, said Vaughan, including: “The number of releases of illegal aliens from ICE custody, the number of people who are caught and released by the Border Patrol, how about the number of people who are here on exchange visas who are working as opposed to studying? The number on [Optional Practical Training] approvals… [and] what ‘training’ they’re doing and the number of terror convicts who are foreign born.”

For example, the agency should release data about ‘IRS tax returns which are filed by people who provide two different [identification] numbers… how many times are returns filed with a number that is used multiple times… how many employers are reporting information that includes Social Security Numbers that are used by multiple employees,” she said.

The Department of Education should collect and release data about how private universities treat applications by people from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. “That’s not something that private universities are willing to divulge,” he told Breitbart News.

Until the federal government chooses to accurately collect and then publicize such crime data, Americans seeking the truth about dangerous criminals released into their communities will continue to be left in the dark.

“Data about Obama’s commutations would be especially useful, for a reason that’s easy to see: They were given out in record numbers, vastly more than any President at least since Eisenhower,” Otis told Breitbart News. “Why was that? Maybe we should examine the facts to find out. It could be that there were so many more harmless or quasi-innocent people in federal prison when Obama was President, but, if so, let’s put the facts on the table.”

“In deciding the real basis for Obama’s nearly unprecedented clemency binge, of course it would be useful for the public (and the press, if it had any interest) to be able to see more of the story behind the clemency decisions,” he said.

“One other thing: Liberals are forever telling us that we need ‘data-driven’ policy, only they seldom seem to welcome the data,” he added.

Vice President Mike Pence is spending Easter Sunday with both U.S. and Republic of Korea military troops as the first stop on a 10-day tour that marks his first official travel to the Asia-Pacific region as Vice President of the United States.

Pence took off on Air Force Two on Saturday with a stopover in Alaska and family and staff in tow.

The first stop is Seoul, Republic of Korea on April 16. Arriving on Easter Sunday, Pence spent the day with troops U.S. and Republic of Korea troops and their families.

Pence and the second lady arrived in the afternoon at Seoul National Cemetery where the Vice President walked down a path lined with guards. He stopped at one point to acknowledge the troops, then continued on to a memorial tower. Accompanied by the superintendent of the cemetery, the head of the memorial division, Mrs. Pence and their two daughters, a guide walked them through steps of a ritual in English.

The Vice President laid a wreath at the memorial wall.

After the wreath laying ceremony, the Pence family attended an Easter Sunday service at a Yongsan military base church. The service began with the traditional Resurrection Sunday call from the pastor of “Christ is arisen,” to which the congregation responded, “He has arisen indeed.” In attendance were a couple hundred people and large choir.

It was a distinct honor to join US &amp; South Korean service members for fellowship during Easter service in Seoul. Happy Easter! #VPinASIA pic.twitter.com/0yca2Bk0qa — Vice President Pence (@VP) April 16, 2017

After the service, The Vice President and Mrs. Pence moved to a room upstairs in the church where military troops were gathered and a meal, pink decor, flowers and U.S. and South Korean flags were displayed.

Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of United States Forces Korea, introduced the Vice President.

Pence brought greetings and a message from commander-in-chief President Donald Trump, ”I spoke to the president earlier today and I spoke to him on the way over, and he asked me to be here, and he told me in no uncertain terms to make sure I told all of you ‘we’re proud of you and we’re grateful for your service.”

“The attention that this part of the world has got from people back home is probably no surprise,” he continued. “This morning’s provocation from the north is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face each and every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world.”

“Your willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear, inspires,” he went on.

The Vice President made mention of his father who served in the Korean War and won the bronze star in 1953.

He remarked to the room:

“I stand before you today very moved this Eastern Sunday, because one of those soldiers more than sixty years ago was my dad. As we landed today on the peninsula I looked out at those rolling hills and I thought about second lieutenant Edward J Pence who was with the 45th infantry division of the United States Army that served here in combat.”

He went on to say:

“On this day I think of my dad. He’s been gone 29 years now and is still enshrined in the hearts of everyone in our family. And I think of what dad would be thinking about and I believe he is thinking about, as he looks down to see his third son return to that place he left so many years ago, and to see that the sacrifices that were made, the commitment that endures here as a result of a free and prosperous South Korea.”

We are so thankful for the blessing of these incredible patriots, and it was a privilege for Karen &amp; me to spend Easter with them. #VPinASIA pic.twitter.com/Xh8AUeRPb9 — Vice President Pence (@VP) April 16, 2017

Before leaving South Korea, the Vice President will participate in a bilateral meeting with Acting Republic of Korea Hwang Kyo-ahn. He will also meet with National Assembly Speaker Chung Sye-kyun and hold a listening session with local business leaders.

From South Korea Pence goes on to Japan, Indonesia, Australia and Hawaii.

The entire 10-day trip will span 53 in-air hours and 21,750 miles.

Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” discussing the Kim Jong Un regime’s recent uptick in testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missile, President Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster said Trump would act “in the best interest of the American people” if necessary.

McMaster said, “I think there’s an international consensus now, including the Chinese and the Chinese leadership, that this is a situation that just can’t continue. And the president has made clear that he will not accept the United States and its allies and partners in the region being under threat from this hostile regime with nuclear weapons. And so we’re working together with our allies and partners and with the Chinese leadership to develop a range of options and the president has asked the National security council to integrate the efforts of the Department of Defense, State, our intelligence agencies, so we can provide options and have them ready for him if this pattern of destabilizing behavior continues.”

He added, “While it’s unclear and we do not want to telegraph in any way how we’ll respond to certain incidents, it’s clear that the president is determined not to allow this kind of capability to threaten the United States. Our president will take action that is in the best interest of the American people.”

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said President Donald Trump does not have “an overall strategy” on foreign policy.

McCain said, “I support what he did and I support the bunker buster bomb, but we’ve got to develop a strategy. There is still not an overall strategy that he can come to congress and his advisors and say, ‘ok here is how we are going to handle Syria. Here is how we are going to handle the post-Mosul Iraq. We have got to have a strategy and I’ll give them some more time but so far that strategy is not apparent.”

Anti-Trump protesters held rallies in several California cities and around the nation on Saturday to demand that President Donald Trump release his income tax returns for the past several years.

The demonstrations were timed to coincide with “Tax Day,” April 15, which is traditionally the deadline for taxpayers to submit their annual returns to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The deadline is April 17 this year, due to the Easter holiday weekend.

The demonstrators complain that unlike previous presidential candidates over the past several decades, Trump did not release any of his tax returns. Many seem convinced that Trump’s returns would prove somehow that he ought to be ineligible for the presidency — much as President Barack Obama’s most vociferous critics (Trump among them) were convinced that his birth certificate would show information that would have made him unelectable or ineligible.

In San Francisco, thousands of protesters demanding Trump’s tax returns — and his ouster –were addressed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. In Los Angeles, protesters — some of them wearing the pink “pussyhats” of earlier protests — chanted: “Donald Trump has got to go.” Protesters in Santa Rosa, in the Sonoma Valley wine country, questioned the Trump campaign’s supposed links to Russia (though no evidence has emerged). In Sacramento, anti-Trump protesters speculated that he had corrupt deals with foreign countries (though why he would not already have been charged, given that the IRS had already seen his tax returns, remained unexplained). In San Diego, marchers admitted that they would still want Trump out of office if he released his tax returns. In Washington, Los Angeles Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) used the tax return rally as an opportunity to renew her calls for Trump’s impeachment.

The protesters seem undeterred by the embarrassing failure of a recent “scoop” by Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, who claimed to have found Trump’s tax returns — only to reveal a 2005 return that showed Trump paying $38 million in federal taxes on $150 million of income. They point out that Trump claimed during the election that he could not reveal his returns because he was under audit — and that he had still failed to reveal his tax returns, many months later.

Appeals from Democrats and the media for Trump to release his tax returns were largely dismissed by conservatives who might otherwise have been sympathetic, given that they had slandered the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, Gov. Mitt Romney, by falsely claiming he had not paid taxes. When that claim was revealed to be a lie, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) — the instigator of the rumors — merely shrugged: “Romney didn’t win, did he?”

President Trump has already raised millions of dollars for his 2020 re-election campaign in the first three months of the year, new Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show as of Friday evening.

Trump’s re-election campaign has already pulled in $13.2 million from three different campaign committees–Donald J. Trump for President, Trump Victory, and Trump Make America Great Again Committee–in the first quarter of 2017, Politico reported.

The campaign has managed to pull off this feat while paying a staff of 20 employees, FEC records show.

Of all the money raised from the three committees, 80 percent came from small donors.

The Republican National Committee said it raised $41.3 million in the first three months of the year, but as of Saturday morning, it had not filed its final quarterly report with the FEC.

The three committees spent a combined total of $4.7 million on hats, T-shirts, mugs, and stickers, according to the reports. They also spent at least $2.7 million on data, telemarketing, and other fundraising activities to maintain its database of largely small donors.

The three Trump committees also spent a combined $458,000 at Trump’s various companies, including $274,000 in rent for the Trump Tower office space and $61,000 at Trump golf clubs.

Trump filed with the FEC to run for re-election in 2020 the day of his inauguration so he could continue to build his fundraising base, especially among small donors.

However, Trump said, “[The paperwork] does not constitute a formal announcement of my candidacy for the 2020 election.”

Even though Trump has not formally announced his candidacy, he has already trademarked his 2020 campaign slogan, which would be “Keep America Great.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b77377c5e:1081275:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Anti-Trump conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch are helping illegal immigrants in the U.S. obtain driver’s licenses, as well as preparing them for citizenship tests.

A fluff piece by TIME Magazine spotlights the Koch Brothers’ LIBRE Initiative organization for its work being done to help illegal immigrants while President Trump and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have successfully increased immigration enforcement.

“It is chaotic. People are very, very worried about their situation,” says Aguado. “One of the things that has been a positive thing through this stress that people have is that they’re more interested in becoming U.S. citizens. She now spends time volunteering to help her neighbors and strangers alike to figure out their immigration status, get papers in order and, in many cases, start the process of converting their legal status into citizenship. The patrons who organize these consultation? The conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch and their deep-pocketed pals who are continuing to spend millions to help promote free-market ideas in Latino communities across the country. Through the Koch network’s LIBRE Initiative, volunteers and advisers are helping immigrants study for drivers’ license exams so they have some form of government ID, others prepare for citizenship tests and still others earn a G.E.D. And it doesn’t matter if they are here legally or not.

Longtime Koch manager Daniel Garza touted the fact that the organization does not ask immigrants seeking help what their legal status is.

“We do not ask what anybody’s legal status. To us, that’s irrelevant. We want to help people drive. We let the politicians worry about whether someone is documented or not documented,” Garza told TIME.

In the Trump administration’s era of law and order, coupled with pro-American immigration enforcement, the Koch Brothers are still reaping the rewards of illegal immigration, as the TIME piece notes.

That’s one reason Koch-backed programs are experiencing a major boost in interest. In Miami, the citizenship study classes averaged 68 participants in December of last year, but last month that number rose to 210 people. Last summer, about 80 people joined the typical session in Orlando; since January, the number now averages 170. There are now 350 people on a wait list for an English-language class in Phoenix, and the citizenship efforts there have more than doubled between December and February, climbing from 30 to 80 participants at each session.

The Koch’s LIBRE Initiative is also continuing to push for amnesty for the more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., with immigration hawks citing that there are most likely about 30 million illegal immigrants.

Despite coalitions like the ‘Gang of Eight,’ which included Democrats and establishment Republicans like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), to push amnesty, the efforts routinely are shot down as they prove to be unpopular with American voters.

Nonetheless, the Koch Brothers still see a route to work with the open borders lobby and get an amnesty through Congress.

And LIBRE is well aware of the political challenges ahead. Part of the billion-dollar policy and politics hub that the Kochs control, LIBRE is a rare voice on the right that pushes for a comprehensive immigration plan. As the Koch network sees it, any immigration overhaul should have four major components: workers cannot be tied to a single employer in a way that leaves them little change for career advancement at rival companies, immigrants with legal status should be able to leave the country to visit their homelands, families should have the right to stay together and the system should not be overly punitive for immigrants in the country illegally. “Let’s not further disadvantage them. Let them get in the back of line,” Garza says. Those positions run to the left of many conservatives. Mitt Romney famously called for immigrants to participate in “self-deportation” and Trump led his giant rallies in cheers of “build the wall.” But that’s precisely why Garza and his colleagues see a chance to repair the GOP’s image among Latinos, who tend to be conservative on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage even as they consistently vote for Democratic candidates.

Garza told TIME that he did not believe Trump’s construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall was a priority, although U.S. Border Patrol agents see the wall as an absolute necessity to ending illegal immigration, as Breitbart Texas reported.

The pro-amnesty, pro-free trade Koch Brothers have criticized Trump’s ‘America First’ agenda from its conception during the 2015-2016 presidential campaign.

As Breitbart News has reported, Trump has pushed back against the Koch Brothers, calling them “puppets” who are a part of the GOP establishment’s special interest groups.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b7730e349:1078736:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Saturday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) weighed in on President Donald Trump’s foreign policy decisions, saying it should “scare us all.”

“We cannot afford to have this president making military decisions and getting in the position to declare war. That is the purview of Congress. We should be debating this issue,” Waters told host Joy Reid.

“We absolutely should be concerned about this president because I believe that he’s making decisions that perhaps should scare us all,” she continued. “He feels as if he has the power to use this military in ways that should frighten all of us.”

More than a dozen arrests were made Saturday afternoon during a rally in Berkeley, CA., where supporters of President Trump encountered protesters intent on disrupting the previously scheduled event.

Hundreds of Trump supporters had gathered at the Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park in Downtown Berkeley, about two blocks from the UC Berkeley campus, for a “Patriots Day” rally. But they were soon met with many black-clad, face-covered counter-demonstrators waving red-and-black anarchy flags, and clashes ensued.

According to the Los Angeles Times, 250 police officers were deployed to the scene. Initially, the sides were separated by makeshift orange plastic barriers, but confrontations soon escalated.

Sixteen people were arrested, Officer Jennifer Coats of the Berkeley Police Department told the Times. Nine people were injured, with six taken to a hospital for treatment, including one stabbing victim, she said.

AJ Alegria, 31, of Sacramento, told the Times he came to Berkeley to help defend Trump supporters and was surrounded by a dozen protesters in black masks who he said attacked him with sticks and pepper spray.

“These people create violence all the time… somebody has to stand up to them,” said Alegria, who was injured in the fight and treated by Trump supporters who bandaged his head, washed off the pepper spray and gave him encouragement, saying, “You’ve earned your stripes, bro.”

Another Trump supporter, Ben Bergquam of Fresno, was also bloodied as the melee moved from the park up Center Street toward the UC Berkeley campus. He held a crumpled “Stop Liberal Intolerance” sign in his hand.

“I got hit in the back of the head with some sticks,” Bergquam told the San Francisco Chronicle as another activist wrapped gauze around his wound. “I don’t agree with everything Trump says, but I don’t agree with violence.”

With assistance from the Oakland Police Department, the Berkeley police fared better at keeping the peace than they did in February, when violent demonstrators set fires and destroyed more than $100,000 worth of property that forced the cancelation of a speech by then-Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley.

The Chronicle reported that several liberal groups long-planned to disrupt the pro-Trump rally with the intent to shut it down.

Defend the Bay, a group that advertises itself as against the self-described “alt-right,” suggested protesters bring food to share, along with a mask or other covering to conceal their identity from police.

The 2010 murder of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry by a 7-time previously deported illegal alien could have been prevented, says the agent’s brother Kent Terry in an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas. Terry’s family hopes the Trump Administration will now go after “the real criminals” responsible for putting the “Fast and Furious” guns in the accused killer’s hands.

A task force including Mexican law enforcement officials, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents and U.S. Border Patrol Border Patrol BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agents arrested accused killer Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes, in Mexico earlier this week, Breitbart Texas reported. Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas stated immigration officials deported Osorio-Arellanes seven times before he returned illegally on December 14, 2010, as part of a Mexican bandit “rip crew.” The accused killer of Agent Terry opened fire on the BORSTAR team in southern Arizona that had been dispatched to find the “rip crew” which had been robbing other drug and human smuggling convoys in the area.

“We just heard that Brian’s shooter had been deported seven times,” Brian Terry’s brother, Kent Terry, told Breitbart Texas. “This is a death that could have been prevented.”

The allegation that Osorio-Arellanes shot Agent Terry with a gun supplied by the U.S. Government in a gun-running operation called “Fast and Furious” made his death even more painful to the family members. To this date, no U.S. law enforcement official involved in supplying over 2,000 guns to Mexican drug cartels under this program have been held to account. The House of Representatives found Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to be in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents related to the Fast and Furious program, Breitbart News reported in June 2012. Seventeen House Democrats joined with the Republican majority in finding Holder in contempt.

“Bob, this arrest puts us another step closer to getting those accountable for Brian’s senseless death that could have been prevented,” Kent Terry explained. “But the real criminals that President Trump and Attorney General Sessions need to look at are Eric Holder, Thomas Brandon, Bill Newell, and the rest who started this scandal known as Fast and Furious.”

“Mr. Trump promised me he would open the books in Brian’s death and now is the time,” an exasperated Kent Terry stated. “My family has waited long enough. In the meantime, I will continue to fight for Brian and Zapata.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata was also killed by Mexican cartel members using weapons obtained through the Fast and Furious Program.

“Our family is extremely happy to hear of the capture of one of the subjects involved in Brian’s murder,” Terry’s sister, Michelle Terry-Balogh told Breitbart Texas. “This is just another step forward toward getting the justice he truly deserves.”

“We want to express our gratitude to the Mexican officials and all the divisions of our US law enforcement that made this apprehension possible,” Michelle expressed. She sends a special thank you to Brian’s brothers in green who are part of the elite BORTAC team that assisted in the apprehension of this suspect.”

“The Terry family continues the fight to bring those held accountable for the botched gun program fast n furious that killed my brother and to honor him through the Brian Terry Foundation that was established to honor his legacy,” she said, echoing Kent’s call for justice.

Brian Terry’s third sibling, Kelly Terry-Willis also expressed her gratitude to all involved in bringing Brian’s accused killer to justice.

“I would like to thank every person involved from day one in the search and apprehension of the latest suspect,” Kelly expressed. “It does not go unnoticed that they put their lives at risk for this mission to be successful. We are closer to justice for Brian.”

“This latest news gave us more hope than we have had in awhile,” she said cautiously. “My guard is still up with this new administration because of all the lies and cover-ups from the previous one, but I more optimistic and hopeful than I have been in six years. Brian cannot and will not be forgotten.”

Nearly one year ago, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump met with the Terry family about their brother’s murder, Breitbart Texas reported.

“He told us how sorry he was about Brian’s senseless death,” Kent Terry told this reporter after the meeting. “Mr. Trump said it was shameful on this administration for starting a scandal like this and shameful for what they’re doing about it.”

“He also is very sincere about Brian’s death. Yes, he promised us if he becomes president, he will open the books on Fast and Furious.”

The Terry family believes it is now time for President Trump and the Republican led Congress do deliver on their promises.

On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks argued President Trump “is making the conclusion that the populism and the Bannon-ism is not working, and he’s going to go to something else.”

Brooks said, “Donald Trump is different. He’s a marketing guy. He’s a business guy, whatever’s working for him at the moment. And it seems, from this many data points, he is making the conclusion that the populism and the Bannon-ism is not working, and he’s going to go to something else. Now, what exactly that else thing is, we don’t really know. It could be sort of a corporatism. It could be, let me trust my business guys. Let’s go to the CEOs, and let’s — those guys, I can trust. There seems to be some instinctual sense who — that he’s shifting teams of who he wants to be his key advisers. And with Trump, because he knows so little, it’s not him personally initiating policy. The crucial question is, who is he listening to? And there’s a clear shift, at least in one week, that there’s been a radical shift in his advisee team.”

An environmental group and an Arizona Democrat legislator have filed the first lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s border wall, though the case may be thrown out.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that the Center for Biological Diversity, a well-known national environmental group along, with Rep. Raúl Grijalva, (D-AZ), the highest ranking member of the House Committee on Natural Resources, filed a legal challenge Wednesday against the Trump’s administration over its proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, which will reportedly start in San Diego County.

The lawsuit specifically names the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which has been soliciting bids for the wall project. The agency informed Breitbart News that it is standard procedure to not comment on any pending litigation.

The Hill reports that the lawsuit focuses on a requirement by Department of Homeland Security to draft a new environmental review to examine the impacts of the wall on the environment.

“Trump’s border wall will divide and destroy the incredible communities and wild landscapes along the border,” Kierán Suckling, the group’s executive director, said in a Wednesday statement, reported by The Hill. “Endangered species like jaguars and ocelots don’t observe international boundaries and should not be sacrificed for unnecessary border militarization,” he added.

The lawsuit’s prospects are not promising, but the goal may be to delay, rather than stop, the building of the wall. A law passed in 2006 — the same year the the Secure Fence Act became law — will likely trump the legal action. It gives DHS a waiver from environmental laws that hamper construction everywhere else in California, granting the department tremendous latitude in the border region in the name of national security.

In recent months, the border wall, which was a controversial linchpin of President Trump’s campaign, has become the symbol of resistance to his policies. Pension funds in California are threatening to divest from any company that participates in building the border wall, and the California legislature is planning to consider a lifetime ban from state contracts against any company that works on the wall.

In an interesting side note, a Los Angeles Times report noted that one contractor addressed threats to wildlife — raised by the lawsuit and Democrat lawmakers alike — with an innovative design that allows some animals to cross over the wall.

Jared Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump enlisted the services of Risa Heller, a New York City public relations figure known for her work with Democrats — including former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Gov. David Paterson (D-NY) — when they came to Washington to take up their official posts in the Trump White House, according to a report in Buzzfeed.

The revelation came amid reports that a New York City set with a history of friendly ties to the Democratic party is gaining traction in President Donald Trump’s White House, much to the chagrin of conservative commentators.

Members of the Kushner family itself donated large sums to Democratic causes until a few years ago, and Jared has reportedly been accused of being “a Democrat” by more nationalist and populist factions within the White House. Another oft-cited member of this NYC-clique is the Director of Trump’s National Economic Council, registered Democrat and former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn.

Asked by Buzzfeed about her choice, Ivanka responded in a statement, “Risa is incredibly talented, driven and passionate. She is a formidable advocate and respected by all as a trustworthy and honest broker of facts.”

Her husband Jared echoed her sentiments. “She’s the best fighter in the business, is universally respected, and most importantly has always told me what she really thinks, good or bad,” he said.

Heller began her career in Schumer’s press office before expanding her horizons in and beyond the political field. She served as communications director for David Paterson as the New York governor who replaced prostitute-patronizing Gov. Eliot Spitzer and then found himself in crises of his own. In addition to allegations of witness tampering by his appointees, Heller managed Paterson’s image through the emergence of the sex and drug scandals that ultimately sunk his reelection hopes.

Anthony Weiner, perpetrator of perhaps politics’ all-time most embarrassing litany of faux-pas, also sought Heller’s help as he tried to weather the media storm of the century that surrounded his multiple “sexting” scandals. Now banished from the political realm, Weiner sung Heller’s praises.

“If I had taken her advice at critical junctures even 5% of the time, I would have been infinitely better off,” he told Buzzfeed. “This may sound ironic coming from me, but she never advocates for not telling the truth. I repeatedly didn’t take that kind of advice where I should have.”

For her own part, Buzzfeed reports Heller continued to argue Weiner was a “good person,” even as the worst details of his improprieties were emblazoned on front pages around the world.

Jared and Ivanka, until recently, haunted the same New York circles in which these Democratic politicians are hounded by the city’s notorious tabloid press. Kushner himself has used Ms. Heller, sending her to handle the New York Times earlier this year when that paper raised questions about a deal of his in China.

Anthony Weiner, for one, seemed to think she was a natural pick to help Jared and his wife in DC. “It doesn’t surprise me that people like the Kushners would gravitate toward her,” he told Buzzfeed.

At the beginning of April, paparazzi supplied the Daily Mail with photos of Ms. Heller heading into Jared and Ivanka’s new home in Washington, DC. Some think Heller is an odd choice to bring so close to Ivanka’s father’s Republican administration. At least one of her own former Democrat colleagues in New York expressed horror at the move. “I think there’s a big difference between representing business interests and essentially helping to advance an agenda that is completely antithetical to everything that Democrats stand for,” the Democratic operative told Buzzfeed.

Heller was reportedly dismayed to be the subject of a Buzzfeed article, but offered a defense of her decision to work for the Kushners: “I fight tirelessly for my clients, period. That’s what I am in business to do. I am proud of what I do and who I do it for.”

Heller is not the first publicity figure the Kushners have brought in from sources Republicans traditionally might not consider. Jared hired PR-exec Josh Raffel right out of Hollywood earlier this month.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b734dd6a7:bee7af:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump will be the first President to speak at the NRA Annual Meetings since Ronald Reagan did it in 1983.

He will speak to the NRA’s 2017 Leadership Forum in Atlanta on April 28.

Breitbart News reported that the NRA endorsed Trump on May 20, 2016, during the 2016 Annual Meetings in Louisville, Kentucky. Thereafter, the NRA campaigned for Trump, and Trump reminded voters again and again that he would work with the NRA to save the Second Amendment if elected.

Trump will now return to speak to the gun rights group that cheered him to victory last year. Bloomberg reports that this will make him “the first U.S. president to address the gun-rights group since Ronald Reagan in 1983.”

Trump’s speech to the NRA will occur two months to the day after he signed a repeal of Barack Obama’s Social Security gun ban which would have allowed the Social Security Administration to strip beneficiaries of the Second Amendment rights without due process. The speech also comes nearly two months after his Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, ended an Obama-era ban against using lead ammunition on federal lands.

On April 13, 2017, Breitbart News reported that the Trump administration has been quietly rolling back other Obama-era gun controls behind the scenes. McClatchy reported that federal agencies have “narrowed the definition of ‘fugitive,’” thereby limiting the number of people prohibited from gun possession because they are included in a fugitive database. Trump “officials have also signaled that they may no longer defend the Army Corps of Engineers’ ban on carrying loaded firearms and ammunition on federal lands.”

Trump’s greatest pro-Second Amendment accomplishment was nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and securing his confirmation. Trump had promised to use SCOTUS to save the Second Amendment from “people like Hillary Clinton,” and Gorsuch is widely viewed as a fulfillment of that promise.

American Pastor Andrew Brunson has been imprisoned in Turkey for more than six months after he was detained for what government officials said was his membership in an “armed terrorist organization,” but now Vice President Mike Pence has reached out to Brunson’s wife, Norine, and pledged the U.S. is working on securing her husband’s release.

The American Center for Law and Justice, which is lobbying for Brunson, reported the letter from Pence comes on the heels of a meeting just days ago between Norine and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his recent diplomatic trip to Turkey.

“On the heels of Pastor Andrew Brunson’s wife personal meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson concerning the wrongful imprisonment of her husband, she received a personal letter from Vice President Pence assuring her that Brunson’s ‘case remains a top priority of the U.S. government,&apos;” ACLJ reported.

Citing his “deep, personal interest” over Brunson’s plight, Pence wrote: “I can assure you both that the State Department and this White House, under President Trump’s leadership, consider Andrew’s release and reunification with you and your three children extremely important.”

Pence also said that he had “personally discussed [Pastor Andrew’s] detention with senior Turkish officials,” according to ACLJ.

Brunson and his wife have lived as Christian missionaries in Turkey for more than 20 years and raised their children there. Now, his family is suffering the loss of their beloved husband, father, and brother.

“It’s been very hard on us as his family,” Beth Herman, Brunson’s sister, told Breitbart News. “We love him and we want him to be back with his family.”

“We really, really want to get this case, my father’s case, to President Trump,” Brunson’s daughter Jacqueline Brunson told Fox News in a recent interview.

Jacqueline Brunson, a college student, told WTVD-TV she’s has put her wedding plans on hold, Faithwire.com reported.

“That’s kind of on hold because I want my dad to be able to walk me down the aisle,” she said. “I want him there. He only gets to see me get married once.”

Brunson made a direct appeal to Trump in a statement he gave to officials at the U.S. Embassy in Turkey:

Will the Turkish government face no consequence for stubbornly continuing to hold an American citizen as a political prisoner? Even though I have a long public track record as a church pastor, they falsely accuse me of being a member of an Islamist terrorist group. I have been imprisoned since October 7, 2016. During this time the Turkish government has produced no proof and has rebuffed numerous attempts by the American government to secure my return to the United States. In fact they are treating the US government with contempt and paying no price for it. I plead with my government – with the Trump Administration – to fight for me. I ask the State Department to impose sanctions. I appeal to President Trump: please help me. Let the Turkish government know that you will not cooperate with them in any way until they release me. Please do not leave me here in prison.

ACLJ also launched a petition drive, which 261,383 people have signed, to show their support for Brunson and to ask for his release and return to the United States.

“We have a strong faith in God,” Brunson’s sister said. “We believe God is with him and he’ll make it through this.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b728ad40b:a4d532:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump stated that “one of the gravest threats to religious freedom remains the threat of terror.”

Transcript as Follows:

“My fellow Americans,

This is a season of great hope.

This week, Jewish families across our country, and around the world, celebrate Passover and retell the story of God’s deliverance of the Jewish people. The story of the Exodus is a story of freedom. It is the story of an incredible people who were liberated from oppression and raised up the face of humankind.

Down through the centuries, the Jewish People have lived through one persecution after another–and yet, they persevered and thrived and uplifted the world beyond measure. And now, the State of Israel stands as a monument to their faith and endurance.

Another day of faith and celebration is also upon us.

This Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Christ and the promise of eternal salvation. It is a holy day of reverence and worship; it is a sacred time that fills the spirit of our Nation with the faith of our people.

America is a Nation of believers.

As families gather in houses of worship across the Nation, we are grateful for the tremendous blessings of this land, our home. We have a beautiful country, an abundant countryside, and an amazing people with a truly bright and wonderful future.

From the beginning, America has been a place that has cherished the freedom of worship. That is the promise the first settlers saw in our vast continent—and it is the promise that our bravest warriors have protected for all of our citizens in centuries since, a long time ago.

Sadly, many around the globe do not enjoy this freedom—and one of the gravest threats to religious freedom remains the threat of terror.

On Palm Sunday, as Christians around the world celebrate the beginning of Holy Week, ISIS murdered at least 45 people and injured over 100 others at two Christian churches in Egypt.

We condemn this barbaric attack. We mourn for those who lost loved ones. And we pray for the strength and wisdom to achieve a better tomorrow—one where good people of all faiths, Christians and Muslims and Jewish and Hindu, can follow their hearts and worship according to their conscience.

With God’s grace, life always triumphs over death, freedom overcomes oppression, and faith extinguishes fear. This is the source of our hope—and our confidence in the future.

I also want to give a special message to those struggling Americans who have felt for too long the bitter taste of hardship. I want you to know: this White House is fighting for you. We are fighting for every American who has been left behind. We are fighting for the right of all citizens to enjoy safety and peace—and to work and live with the dignity that all Children of God are entitled to know.

As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, we will succeed.

Thank you. Have a Happy Easter, and a Happy Passover. God bless you. And God bless America.”

On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump promised to roll back federal regulations. And at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February, chief strategist Steve Bannon said that the goal of the administration was the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”

Trump has delivered on those pledges, signing over a dozen laws reversing Obama-era regulations, marking the most substantial legislative achievement of his first 100 days in office.

Politico has downplayed Trump’s slew of repeal laws, describing them as “the only substantive bills Trump has signed so far.” And, in keeping with a media-wide effort to separate Trump from his voting base, Politico claims that “none of them evoke the drain-the-swamp anti-establishment populism that Trump rode to the presidency.”

The opposite is true, on both counts: Trump has permanently removed some of the regulatory muck that the “swamp” uses to feed itself.

His weapon has been the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which Politico calls “obscure.” It was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, when he was campaigning for re-election and determined to prove he had learned the lessons of the 1994 midterm elections — that “the era of big government is over.” The CRA allows Congress to overturn rules by a federal agency 60 days after they are reported to Congress. It was aimed at rules made by “lame duck” presidents.

But as the Wall Street Journal‘s Kimberly Strassel noted in January, two factors make the CRA particularly powerful. One is inherent to the legislation itself, which provides that a regulation, once repealed, cannot be promulgated again without a new act of Congress.

The other factor is the arrogance and incompetence of the Obama administration, which failed to report many rules to Congress — meaning the 60-day window never began even for some earlier Obama rules.

Here is the list of Obama-era regulations that President Trump has managed to repeal using the CRA so far:

The window for repealing rules from the last several months of Obama’s presidency closes in May — though some argue that President Trump may have the power to repeal regulations dating back to the start of Obama’s first term.

Regardless, the use of the CRA to repeal regulations has put future administrations on notice that there is a limit to government’s regulatory reach, and that given the opportunity by the voters, conservatives will enforce those limits.

It is true that the Trump administration has not yet signed a major, signature piece of legislation. Neither had Obama in the first 100 days — unless one counts the stimulus, which wasted nearly a trillion dollars and inspired the Tea Party. The “failure” of the American Health Care Act, which intended to repeal and replace Obamacare, may be temporary, as Republicans are determined to revisit the issue and propose new legislation that can be signed by the 2018 midterms.

Even without the CRA, the Trump administration can claim it scored two other major achievements in the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and the renewal of America’s military deterrent after the recent attack on Syria.

But the use of the CRA is no small accomplishment. Future administrations will never be as careless in expanding the executive authority of the federal government far beyond the scope of the authority envisioned in the U.S. Constitution.

The massive U.S. military strike on a network of tunnels along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border used by the local Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) branch may have plugged the hole that allowed the flow of jihadi reinforcements from Pakistan into Afghanistan.

On Thursday, American Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, reportedly ordered the U.S. military to drop the 21,600 pound GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb (MOAB) on an already weakened Afghan ISIS branch.

“This was the right weapon against the right target,” the general told reporters in Afghanistan Friday.

“Let me be clear — we will not relent in our mission to fight alongside our Afghan comrades to destroy ISIS-K in 2017,” he said, referring to ISIS’s regional wing known as the Khorasan Province (ISIS-K).

The strike, which took place in the Achin district of eastern Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, marked the first time the colossal munition, known as the “mother of all bombs,” has been used in combat.

According to the U.S. military, the primary target of the GPS-guided bomb was a network of fortified underground tunnels that the terrorist group had been using to stage attacks on U.S.-backed Afghan forces and freely move back and forth across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

Achin lies along the international boundary between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Most ISIS fighters in Afghanistan are Pashtuns from Pakistan, former members of the Pakistani Taliban or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), according to the Pentagon.

At the time of the strike, the American military believed the ISIS branch had been dramatically degraded, from a peak of 3,000 jihadis to between 600 and 800 ISIS fighters on the ground when the bomb was dropped, the vast majority of them in Nangarhar.

MOAB took out at least another 36 ISIS fighters and has significantly reduced the Islamic State’s ability to bring in reinforcements from Pakistan.

“The strike was designed to minimize risk to Afghan and U.S. Forces,” wrote the U.S. Department of Defense on Twitter Friday, showing a video of the blast.

In addition to digging up tunnels and caves, ISIS jihadists had reportedly mined the target area in Achin, preventing U.S.-backed Afghan troops from advancing further.

The psychological impact of MOAB’s deafening blast on survivors or observers is considered an added effect of the bomb.

U.S.-backed Afghan forces can now focus on further diminishing the number of ISIS fighters in Afghanistan.

The Pentagon has identified opium-rich Nangarhar as the Afghan ISIS branch’s primary stronghold in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.

U.S. military officials consider Achin district to be the epicenter that stronghold.

The Pentagon’s media wing announced the recent strike on the group in an article titled, “U.S. Bombs, Destroys Khorasan Group Stronghold in Afghanistan.”

ISIS-K established its presence in the Afghanistan region back in January 2015, less than a month after the previous U.S. administration declared an end to the American combat mission in Afghanistan.

By the time the end of combat was announced on December 31, 2014, the United States had substantially reduced its military footprint.

Only an estimated 8,400 American troops still remain, down from a peak of 100,000.

Under former U.S. President Barack Obama last year, U.S.-backed Afghan forces launched a failed offensive to push ISIS-K out of Nangarhar.

By October 2016, Gen. Nicholson was sounding the alarm on ISIS-K being “very focused on trying to establish their caliphate, the Khorasan caliphate, inside Afghanistan.”

The group had been reduced by about two-thirds, to an estimated 1,000 fighters, Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, the Kabul-based spokesman for the U.S.-NATO mission in Afghanistan, told Pentagon reporters in October 2016.

Nevertheless, as Gen. Nicholson noted, the jihadist organization remained a threat.

The U.S. military last week intensified the fight against the group in its Nangarhar stronghold.

Unlike his predecessor, President Trump has granted U.S. military commanders the freedom to act independently, allowing Gen. Nicholson to make the decision to drop MOAB without input from Washington.

“Everybody knows exactly what happens. So, what I do is I authorize our military,” said Trump on the day the bomb was dropped.

“We have given them total authorization and that’s what they’re doing,” he added, referring to U.S. commanders.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6fd46711:7bcfe7:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Thursday, NBC News reported that “multiple senior U.S. intelligence officials” were saying the United States was prepared to launch a “pre-emptive strike with conventional weapons against North Korea, should officials become convinced that North Korea is about to follow through with a nuclear weapons test.”

The report was quickly denounced as wildly inaccurate by Trump administration officials, but a North Korean official said on Friday that his country was prepared to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against U.S. forces if they carry out “reckless military maneuvers.”

The NBC report quoted unnamed intelligence officials who said the U.S. has positioned two destroyers with Tomahawk missiles near North Korea, within range of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site where a detonation may be imminent. Heavy bombers in Guam and the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group were also said to be available for operations against North Korea, plus ground troops stationed in South Korea and preparations for cyber warfare.

Trump administration officials quickly lashed out at the NBC News report, calling it “wildly wrong,” “crazy,” and “extremely dangerous.”

Some of the less energetic criticism allowed that the facts provided by NBC were true enough and no great secret – the redirection of the Vinson to Korean waters has been public knowledge for days, and Guam certainly hasn’t moved further away from North Korea recently – but the tenor of the report was alarmist and dangerously provocative to the volatile North Korean regime. Officials pushing back against the report insisted there was no active plan to launch pre-emptive strikes against North Korea.

As for the Navy’s Tomahawk missiles, they can hit targets a thousand miles away. It would not be terribly difficult to put the Punggye-ri test site within missile range. The Vinson battle group includes two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers and a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser, according to a report at The Diplomat, so it’s not shocking news that Tomahawks are coming within range of North Korea.

Interestingly, The Diplomat also reports that an unknown number of Japanese destroyers are accompanying the Vinson to conduct maritime drills. Included among the equipment they might be drilling with is the Aegis anti-ballistic missile system.

North Korea’s threat of pre-emptive nuclear pre-retaliation came on Friday from Vice Foreign Minister Han Song Ryol, who said, “If the U.S. comes with reckless military maneuvers then we will confront it with the DPRK’s pre-emptive strike. We’ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands, and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a U.S. pre-emptive strike.”

Han was more incensed by President Trump’s Twitter feed than media reports of possible American action. “Trump is always making provocations with his aggressive words,” he said. “It’s not the DPRK but the U.S. and Trump that makes trouble.” He was riffing on a Trump tweet that said North Korea was “looking for trouble.”

“Whatever comes from the U.S., we will cope with it. We are fully prepared to handle it,” Han declared.

“The US introduces into the Korean peninsula, the world’s biggest hotspot, huge nuclear strategic assets, seriously threatening peace and security of the peninsula and pushing the situation there to the brink of a war. This has created a dangerous situation in which a thermo-nuclear war may break out any moment,” said a statement from the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s Institute for Disarmament and Peace.

The NBC report noted that South Korea’s government remains confident it would be consulted before any actions are taken against North Korea.

“U.S. officials, mindful of such concerns here, repeatedly reaffirmed that (the U.S.) will closely discuss with South Korea its North Korea-related measures. In fact, the U.S. is working to reassure us that it will not, just in case that we might hold such concerns,” Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told a special meeting of parliament in Seoul, as quoted by NBC.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6fb3c392:7162fc:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

DETROIT, Michigan — President Trump’s base appears to be growing concerned with the direction of his administration, against the backdrop of a number of drastic policy shifts from the campaign period as well as his first few weeks in office.

As the notorious “first 100 days” mark rushes up on him, President Trump will have to perform a careful balancing act between the two evident camps in the White House: the nationalists and the globalists, between which a real reconciliation looks unlikely.

The former appears to be supported by the campaign’s base — the people who put Trump in office. The latter appears to appeal to the President on the grounds of more positive headlines, less contentious policy issues as far as establishment media coverage is concerned, and his preternatural, New York liberal outlook.

It’s not all bad news for the President, but it is a warning to be heeded. Here in Michigan, Trump voters, campaigners, and low-level donors expressed concern to this Breitbart News correspondent on the recent change in his direction — citing the travel ban, border control, and the power of his relatives in his administration as key areas of concern.

“We’re watching a man who can take action every single day,” Jeff, a long-standing Trump supporter, told me. He went on:

He doesn’t need to go to Congress. He can take action. We’re watching him carefully. We’re talking about people who have lives to live. Grandchildren to take care of. And we’re watching actions day to day and they’re falling flat. They’re receding from why we put the man there, and it is extremely, it is more than stressful. We’re keeping track, we’re watching it. We do not want to hear about family members having an impact. We voted. We have high expectations for impact.

Not everyone was so glum, however. One local cab driver dismissed such concerns, telling me that President Trump would listen to whomever he had to on a variety of issues, and if they tried to “bounce him” too much, he’d push back, perhaps even stop listening.

I asked him, given his sunny disposition on the issue, “Do you think the border wall will be built?”

He shot me a wry smile in his rear view mirror: “No. But I don’t think it matters.”

“I might take a permanent break [from Trump]!” said Cindy, a local Republican Party activists who admits to having preferred Sen. Ted Cruz in the primaries.

“Oh no you’re not!” her friend shot back. They laughed heartily about her irritation, but she continued still: “I look every day to see if he put that [travel] ban on. I look every day,” she said, insisting that the White House had not done enough to force through President Trump’s executive order pausing the flow of refugees and calling for extreme vetting.

Some even stated they’d be hard to win back, even though it’s been fewer than 100 days for President Trump’s administration.

Perhaps, I thought, their frustration emanates from the fact that candidate Trump promised so much on “day one.” His blunt approach during the campaign perhaps lulled supporters into thinking these were literal “day one” promises. He had said during the campaign that “day one” would include imposing Congressional term limits, repealing Obamacare, deporting illegal immigrants, fixing Veteran’s Affairs, redressing the balance of NATO, getting rid of gun free zones in schools, and a whole lot more.

Although President Trump swiftly acted on some issues such as “ending the war on coal” and appears to be moving toward a renegotiation of NAFTA, on others, he has performed a complete 180-degree turn, evidenced this week by his chumminess with NATO’s Secretary General, and a U-turn on replacing Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen and his prior disdain for the Export-Import Bank.

He relied heavily on these issues in his campaign videos, especially the ones targeted at The Great Lakes State in the final few weeks of the 2016 campaign:

While these names were not first to the lips of the dozens I spoke to in Michigan — which I am not claiming is science — they did stress their growing disaffection with the executive branch.

“I feel like it’s gone so far now the wrong way that it’s going to take something magnificent on his part to get people back. We’re fish that are off the hook right now. He only has one small chance to get us hooked again,” Penny, a middle-aged lady from Sterling Heights, told me, adding:

Jared and Ivanka were not on the ballot. I did not vote for them, nor would I if given the opportunity. There is a reason we have anti-nepotism rules. The fact that they were aided by the odious Jamie Gorelick in circumventing those rules pours salt in our wounds. Now it looks like the counterbalance of Bannon and Kellyanne is being marginalized. President Trump seems to have forgotten the loyal supporters who have been behind him since the early primary days. I feel so very betrayed.

And being in Detroit, a common theme was Islam and Muslim immigration. All bar one person I spoke to on the matter agreed that the Muslim Brotherhood should be designated as a terrorist organisation, and that refugee resettlement into the United States needs immediate curtailment.

With what I gathered in Dearborn and Hamtramck — as research for my upcoming book — I was hardly surprised.

“There is at least 50 people I know that are disappointed that the Hijra to America is continuing,” Cindy said, concluding: “Lay off the Freedom Caucus; we are the grassroots supporters.”

The writing is obviously not yet on the wall as far as a second Trump term goes. But if the first 100 days — especially the second half of that time period — are anything to go by — the Donald will have some serious explaining to do in about three years time.

Friday on CNN’s “Situation Room,” CNN political director David Chalian said President Donald Trump’s recent foreign policy maneuvers mean he is “going mainstream” and Washington “establishment.”

Chalian said, “I don’t know if we’re seeing a Trump doctrine take shape. Certainly, Donald Trump is not portraying it as such. It’s a little bit more of these disparate and discrete incidents that have happened, whether the Syria attack or this bomb. In fact, you just said it was a tactical move that the theater commander was able to make, not necessarily the large—part of a strategic framework here, and I think—the only thing that I could sort of ascertain in observing what Donald Trump is doing right now is that he’s going mainstream—a little establishment, which is totally against the brand that he ran on.”

“But he—I think it shows the power—and when I say establishment, I don’t mean just Republican establishment—Democrat—the Washington establishment—and it shows the power and the stranglehold that the establishment has,” he continued. “I know he tried to bust it up during the campaign and saying that he was going to be the irritant and destroy it, but when you don’t have ideological moorings—you’re not moored, that’s guided, then I think you’re susceptible to the power of the establishment and I think that’s what we see playing out right now with Donald Trump.”

CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash added, “He said the world has changed, and it hasn’t. I mean, things change every day in the world, but the—but the overall sort of zeitgeist of where these hot spots are is where they were when he took office, so it wasn’t that. It was him, and it is him, and—and to your point, David, it’s that he’s not a dogmatic guy. He never was. If he was a dogmatic guy, then he would have run for the Democratic nomination because he would still be pro-choice and for single-payer health care system but he’s not. He switched, you know, did a complete 180 on those issues and so it’s not surprising that he is willing to—to use his words, be flexible when it comes to a whole host of issues, as he’s learning a really, really hard, really new job that people who are even ideological and get the job tend to realize, you know, I need to switch a little bit.”

Critics are blasting President Donald Trump for ending an Obama-era policy of releasing White House visitor logs on Friday.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), for example, called the move “the latest in a series of efforts by President Trump to avoid public accountability.”

In reality, the White House visitor logs rarely informed the public of anything. They were a fig leaf that let the Obama administration claim transparency while hiding its real operations.

(Update: Moreover, the Obama administration went to court to resist releasing the visitor logs, at least initially.)

Andrew Breitbart was the first to catch onto President Barack Obama’s con game. In March 2011, he posted an essay — at the Huffington Post, no less — titled: “The White House Guess List: How Obama Pulled a Fast One on the American People — in the Name of ‘Transparency.&apos;”

Breitbart pointed out that “the visitor logs may hide more than they reveal”:

The White House is still holding back “tens of thousands” of visitor logs, according to congressional testimony last week by Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, who also added that “the Obama administration is less transparent than the Bush administration.” We also know that some of the most important presidential visitors don’t even walk into the White House. The administration meets K Street lobbyists at Caribou Coffee, and holds secret meetings in Jackson Place townhouses where there are no visitor logs. The visitor logs that have been released are problematic, because they are simply lists of names, with no way to verify whether a specific name belongs to a particular person. … With no way to verify, there is no real transparency.

The visitor logs were a key part of President Barack Obama’s claim to have run “the most transparent administration in history.” But in every other way, he was one of the least transparent presidents in the post-Watergate era. Obama “set a record” for failing to comply with Freedom of Access to Information Act requests, among other anti-transparency sins.

Obama’s visitor logs were no deterrent to the crooked and malevolent. Logs revealed that left-wing activist Robert Creamer, a convicted felon and the man behind an effort to instigate violence at Trump campaign events, visited the White House some 340 times, with 45 visits including the president himself. The media never cared, nor did he.

Arguably, two wrongs don’t make a right. The fact that the Trump administration took advantage of the Good Friday holiday to announce the policy change might suggest some degree of moral doubt.

Yet the fact is that visitor logs were never a useful tool to enforcing executive transparency. Better tools are needed, and it is foolish to pretend otherwise.

Last week’s American airstrike on a Syrian base believed to house chemical weapons used to attack Syrian civilians has brought the issue of refugees once again to the forefront of the political debate.

Democrats, ranging from Hillary Clinton to Maxine Waters, have used the airstrike as an opportunity to call again for the importation of 100,000 more Syrian refugees into the United States.

“Rep. Maxine Waters (D, Calif.) slammed President Donald Trump on Sunday for his temporary refugee ban and backed a MoveOn.org petition calling for the United States to take in 100,000 Syrian refugees,” the Free Beacon reported earlier this week.

“Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton chided President Trump Friday for ordering airstrikes against the Syrian regime at the same time as he attempts to bar Syrian refugees from the U.S., urging the administration to recognize that we cannot in one breath speak of protecting Syrian babies and in the next close America’s doors to them,” CBS News reported last week.

But for President Trump and many Republicans, the airstrike presents an opportunity to re-introduce a concept President Trump raised on the campaign trail: the establishment of refugee safe zones overseas.

The summary of President Trump’s proposed budget for FY 2018 released by OMB in March suggests the administration may be including a funding request to establish such refugee zones.

“The blueprint for the Trump administration’s FY 2018 budget released on Thursday ‘allows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster, and refugee program funding’ in the State Department,” Breitbart News reported in March:

The language of the blueprint, however, could be interpreted to suggest that the Trump administration’s “significant funding of . . . [the] refugee program” defines the program broadly to include safe zones in other parts of the world in addition to the federal refugee resettlement program. As such, a further reduction of refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2018 could be entirely possible. President Trump supported the establishment of safe zones for refugees during the campaign.

The Refugee Admissions Program authorized by the Refugee Act of 1980 has been surrounded by political and legal chaos for several years, and that controversy has heightened during the campaign of 2016 and the first months of the Trump administration.

Trump campaigned on stopping the flow of Syrian refugees to the United States, while Hillary Clinton wanted to dramatically increase that flow.

Trump won the Presidency in part based on his stance on refugees, but his efforts to honor his campaign pledge have been hampered by court decisions that have temporarily halted both Executive Order 13769 and Executive Order 13780.

Overall, the flow of refugees into the United States has declined under the Trump administration, but a significant number of refugees from the six Middle Eastern countries “hostile to the United States” Trump attempted to impose a temporary travel ban on in Executive Order 13780 — Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, and Yemen–has continued unabated.

Paying for the resettlement of refugees is expensive. Breitbart News estimated that the annual cost to American taxpayers to fund the resettlement of refugees exceeds $4 billion. Several cost estimates indicate that safe zones overseas would cost less than ten percent, on a per refugee basis, what it costs to resettle a refugee in the United States.

In addition to the financial cost of refugee resettlement, the cultural cost to the United States is very high as well, since refugees–especially from Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, and Yemen–have a long track record of failing to assimilate into American culture.

That failure manifests itself in several ways.

These refugees have been involved in a number of terrorist incidents in the United States. Somalian refugees in particular have participated in a number of terrorist incidents in the United States and been arrested for attempting to join ISIS.

Then there is the huge public health impact of refugees, again particularly from these six countries in the Middle East.

Breitbart News has reported, for instance, that the number of cases of active TB from refugees during the four year period from 2012 to 2015 exceeded 1,500:

Finally, there is a huge problem of common crimes committed by refugees who do not assimilate into American culture, or actively reject it.

“Three boys from Iraq and Sudan who were invited into the country via refugee programs pled guilty to charges of sexually brutalizing a five-year-old American child in Twin Falls, Idaho, last year,” Breitbart News reported earlier this month.

In North Dakota recently a “Somali refugee in the U.S. was sentenced to 20 years in prison after being convicted of molesting a teenage girl at gunpoint,” Breitbart News reported.

The list of crimes reported by refugees in the United States is much longer than this, as a brief scan of the daily headlines around the country confirms on a regular basis.

In one recent key appointment, President Trump indicated that it may no longer be “business as usual” in the Refugee Admissions Program.

“President Donald Trump has selected Scott Lloyd to serve as the new director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), the office within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers the payments to the voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) that resettle refugees in the United States,” Breitbart News reported last month.

Still, Obama holdovers who have historically been strong refugee advocates, most notably Jennifer Higgins, remain in positions of authority in the Department of Homeland Security’s program responsible for refugee vetting.

The Trump administration will shortly reveal how serious it is about establishing refugee safe zones overseas as a preferable alternative to bringing thousands more Middle Eastern refugees into the United States.

The Continuing Resolution that has funded the federal government’s operations for the first half of FY 2017 is about to expire later this month on April 28.

Recent comments by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) suggest refugee safe zones may be part of budget considerations. McConnell “wouldn’t comment on whether Trump should let refugees into the U.S., but said it would be beneficial to create some safe zone in Syria, “which would require some military action…so people don’t feel like they have to run for their lives,” Axios reported last week.

Any proposal by the Trump administration to increase refugee funding to establish safe zones during the remainder of FY 2017 will be included in the budgets brought to a vote in Congress to fund the balance of the fiscal year later this month.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6f3eb9ac:717c91:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A Google Chrome browser extension titled “Drop United” allows users to easily filter out United Airlines flights while browsing online.

The extension blocks United from search results on Google Search, Google Flights, Kayak, and Expedia, according to The Hill. The official website for the extension attacks United for violently removing a passenger from a flight.

“Corporations can treat you like shit because you’ll eventually forget you were ever mad,” the website states. “Drop United is a Chrome extension that drags United Airlines off your flight search results. So the next time you search for a flight, United won’t have a seat in your options.”

The incident made headlines after footage of the passenger who refused to give up his seat was released, showing him covered in blood as he was forcibly dragged out by his legs screaming.

Chinese social media raged over the incident, while both President Trump and numerous celebrities condemned the airline for their handling of the situation.

Drop United has already received numerous five star reviews, which thank the app’s anonymous creator for assisting the growing boycott, while also joking about the incident with United Airlines.

President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has dropped a 2016 pro-transgender lawsuit against the state of North Carolina, marking another success for mainstream advocates who wish to preserve normal single-sex facilities and institutions.

The lawsuit was filed in May 2016 by deputies working for President Barack Obama, who was ideologically opposed to any civic or legal recognition that men and women are biologically different as well as legally equal.

That pro-transgender hostility towards biological heterosexuality is deeply unpopular among Americans, who prefer that civic society help women and men cooperate to ensure the next generation is birthed and educated. For example, most Americans recognize that women and men have a civil right to prefer their single-sex institutions, including bathrooms, changing rooms and sports leagues.

The decision to quit the pro-transgender lawsuit was denounced by groups who are trying to impose a nationwide “genderless society” which would suppress any civic or legal recognition of the differences between the two sexes. For example, Chase Strangio, a pro-transgender activist at the ACLU complained that the decision by Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions means “there is no civil rights division” at the agency.

There is no civil rights division at DOJ anymore. We are the civil rights division. We are the resistance. And we will win. — Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) April 14, 2017

ACLU, @LambdaLegal, @ACLU_NC condemn Trump Administration&apos;s withdrawal of #HB2 lawsuit https://t.co/yZYIF4CbHT — ACLU National (@ACLU) April 14, 2017

The May 2016 lawsuit was filed then by Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and it demanded that the state’s residents give up their civil right to have single-sex public bathrooms and locker rooms for both biological sexes.

The lawsuit was reinforced by Obama’s directions to the nation’s K-12 schools, which told administrators to accept and support any child’s claim they are transgender, to hide children’s sexual claims from their parents, and to punish other children who decline to use pronouns favored by a “transgender” child — such as “him” or her” – even in science class.

In the lawsuit against North Carolina, Obama’s lawyers claimed single-sex facilities discriminate against men or women who want to live as members of the opposite sex. They insisted that 1970s civil rights laws actually require that a person’s feeling about their maleness or femaleness, dubbed “Gender Identity,” be treated as more important than their actual male or female heterosexual biology. “Transgender men are men — they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women — they live, work and study as women,” declared Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice’s civic regulation division, in a May press conference.

Gupta was forced out of the agency after Americans choose Trump as their new president in November. Since then, Obama has twice admitted that his focus on transgender ideology helped Trump win the election.

On Friday, Gupta denounced the Justice Department’s decision.

Sadly predictable. They can dismiss but they cannot erase. The fight for LGBTQ justice is strong. https://t.co/tMiR2B0y15 — Vanita Gupta (@vanitaguptaCR) April 14, 2017

Despite pressure from business, the establishment and the sports industry, North Carolina’s voters and legislators decided that the state officials will decide who is treated as a legal male or a legal female in the state. They passed HB2 in 2016, and then defeated a business boycott of the state by passing H142 in March 2017.

Both laws were bitterly opposed by transgender activists because they reinforce the existing rules that treat men and women as equal, different and complementary in a heterosexual society, while also allowing people to flip their legal sex once they undergo a medical procedure.

Transgender activists vowed to continue their lawsuit against the state, and their political campaign against the “gender binary.” The state’s HB142 law is being defended in court by a Democratic Attorney General.

But we&apos;re not backing down. Our lawsuit with @ACLU and @ACLU_NC will continue. We will keep fighting. #WeObject https://t.co/HBwZwyUZU1 — Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) April 14, 2017

It is unclear if the Justice Department will fully switch sides and help defend the state’s pro-heterosexuality HB142 law.

The transgender hostility to heterosexual differences is deeply unpopular among Americans, and only about one-quarter of Americans support the idea that people should be allowed to easily change their legal sex.

The number of transgender Americans is very low. Advocates claim that a third of one percent of Americans are at least somewhat transgender. But a study of the 2010 census showed that only about 1-in-2,400 adults had changed their name from one sex to the other.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6e9b8b53:64dd8f:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason.

In this week’s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie discusses the looming threat of North Korea, and explains how President Donald Trump could win the support of the Hollywood left if the U.S. needs to strike first.

“If he decides to bomb them, the whole country will be behind him, because everybody will realize he had no choice and that was the only thing to do,” Jackie says. “Except the Hollywood left. They’ll get nauseous.”

“[Trump] could win the left over, they’ll fall in love with him in a minute. If he bombed them for a better reason,” Jackie explains. “Like if they have no transgender toilets.”

Jackie also says it’s no surprise that Hollywood celebrities didn’t support Trump’s strike on a Syrian airfield this month.

“They were infuriated,” he says. “Because it might only save lives. That doesn’t mean anything to them. If it only saved the environment, or climate change! They’d be the happiest people in the world.”

Still, Jackie says he’s got nothing against Hollywood celebs. They’ve got a tough life in this country.

Watch Jackie’s latest clip above.

A former Obama Administration official responsible for the detention of illegal immigrants said President Donald Trump and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly are “dismantling the progress we had made.”

Kevin Landy, President Barack Obama’s director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Detention Policy and Planning, took exception to President’s Trump’s decision to shut down his department. Under Secretary Kelly, the DHS is poised to change some of the hotel-like conditions illegal immigrants, including criminals, receive while in detention.

As an example, illegal immigrants in two Orange County, California, detention facilities have daily clothing and bedding changes performed by a jail employee. The standard for other criminal facilities is a weekly change.

“That one seems a little overkill,” detaining center Commander Jon J. Briggs told the New York Times.

“Jail is jail,” Butler County, Ohio, Sheriff Richard Jones told the New York newspaper. “It’s fair and it’s human, but we don’t put chocolates on the pillows.”

Landy reacted to the Trump Administration’s efforts to toughen standards in the detention centers and claimed, “a decision to simultaneously abandon detention standards could have disastrous consequences for the health and safety of these individuals.”

He said he hoped Secretary Kelly, “wouldn’t want to dismantle the progress we had made,” but didn’t really detail what “progress” he was referencing.

The New York Times detailed some of the “progress” he might have been referencing. The ever growing list of requirements call for:

Notify immigration officials if a detainee spends two weeks or longer in solitary confinement. Check on suicidal inmates every 15 minutes, and evaluate their mental health every day. Inform detainees, in languages they can understand, how to obtain medical care. In disciplinary hearings, provide a staff member who can advocate in English on the detainee’s behalf.

ICE officials declined to comment on Landy’s claims, stating only that the agency responsible for enforcing immigration law is “in the midst of examining a variety of detention models to determine which models would best meet anticipated detention needs.”

The Clinton Administration established the initial standards in 2000. Since that time, they expanded under President George W. Bush in 2008 and again under President Obama in 2011. The current guidelines now fill 455 pages and go into “granular detail on subjects including the minimum number of toilets — one for every 12 detainees in male facilities or eight detainees in female facilities — and trash bag thickness (at least 1.5 millimeters),” the New York Times reported.

With the crackdown on criminal aliens and other deportable individuals under the Trump Administration, more detention facilities will be required and costs will be an increasing concern.

Commander Briggs told the reporter from the New York Times the Trump Administration has already requested 500 additional beds. They warned that more will be coming in the months ahead.The commander said he currently can take only 120 at this time.

President Donald Trump has appointed freedom of conscience and religious liberty defender Roger Severino to head the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Severino, the former director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation, has been especially known for his criticism of Obamacare’s “nondiscrimination” regulations on the basis of “gender identity.” The guidelines propose to penalize healthcare professionals who are morally and professionally opposed to sex change surgeries and treatments.

Severino and Ryan Anderson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, observed in a report in 2016 that Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) provides guidelines that “force many physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers to participate in sex-reassignment surgeries and treatments, even if it violates their religious beliefs or their best medical judgment.”

“Moreover, because they apply so broadly, the regulations propose to also force employers, individuals, and taxpayers to fund coverage for such procedures even if doing so conflicts with their sincere beliefs,” Severino and Anderson added.

“It’s a super appointment. Roger Severino is a very balanced thinker who is also an experienced litigator,” said Family Research Council senior fellow Ken Blackwell, according to LifeSiteNews. Blackwell added Severino, who also worked as CEO and legal counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, is “associated with some of the best thinkers in the area of civil rights policy.”

LGBT rights advocates criticized Severino’s appointment.

“I could not think of a more dangerous person to head up the Office of Civil Rights at HHS,” JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president of policy and public affairs at the Human Rights Campaign said, according to Yahoo. “Once again, Donald Trump is declaring war against our community by appointing anti-LGBTQ people at all levels of his administration.”

“The Office for Civil Rights at HHS is essential to ensuring that all people can lead healthy lives, free of discriminatory barriers,” said Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, adding, “Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which bans discrimination based on race, sex, disability and age in health programs and activities, is key to achieving this goal. Strong and experienced leadership at OCR committed to fully enforcing Section 1557 is therefore critical. Mr. Severino is not that leader.”

Henderson added Severino’s appointment is “part of a disturbing trend by the Trump administration of naming people who disagree or outright oppose the mission or role of an agency or office to leadership positions within those entities.”

Writing at the Daily Signal last year on the issue of North Carolina’s bathroom privacy policy, Severino asserted, “The radical left is using government power to coerce everyone, including children, into pledging allegiance to a radical new gender ideology over and above their right to privacy, safety, and religious freedom.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6e191f40:58a302:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Three so-called government watchdog groups have reportedly banded together to sue the Department of Homeland Security for the release the logs of visitors to the White House and to President Trump’s homes in both New York and Florida.

Unreported in the news media coverage of the lawsuit is that two of the three organizations are directly funded by billionaire George Soros’s Open Society Foundations while the third group is the project of a fund that has financed leftist groups along with Soros.

Politico, which first reported on the news-making lawsuit, documented:

The suit, set to be filed Monday in federal court in New York, contends that the Secret Service is in violation of the law by failing to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests for details on visitors to the White House and other locations where Trump has spent time since taking office. … By filing in New York rather than in Washington, where most FOIA suits are filed, the plaintiffs may be trying to avoid having the case scuttled by a key legal precedent already on the books that sharply limits the public’s right to see logs of visitors to the White House complex.

The three organizations that filed the complaint are the National Security Archive, the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government (CREW), which Politico notes was also involved in a Bush-era lawsuit for government records.

The National Security Archive documents on the “funders and support” section of its website that it is funded by Soros’s Open Society Institute as well as the Open Society Fund, Inc.

CREW, the second group that is party to the visitor logs lawsuit, describes itself as an organization that utilizes “high-impact legal actions to target government officials who sacrifice the common good to special interests.”

CREW, which does not publicize its donor list, has received financing from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. According to Discover the Networks, CREW has also been funded by the Soros-financed Tides Foundation.

In August 2014, longtime Hillary Clinton ally David Brock, founder of the heavily Soros-financed Media Matters for America progressive group, was elected chairman of CREW’s board.

Brock departed the organization last December, but Politico reported in January that CREW is part of a network of groups for which the activist is attempting to raise $40 million to take on Trump.

Also in January, CREW filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump is in violation of a Constitutional clause banning government officials from accepting benefits from foreign nations.

The third organization suing for the visitor logs is the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. The Institute, a $60 million effort, was launched last year by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation together with Columbia University.

Numerous Knight Foundation projects are also financed by Soros. The Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas at the University of Texas at Austin, for example, was also the recipient of a $270,000 grant from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. The Knight Foundation and the Open Society both fund the ProPublica journalism project. The two charities are also founding sponsors of the New Americans Campaign, which says it seeks to “help modernize naturalization assistance in the United States and help more lawful permanent immigrants become U.S. citizens.”

Since Trump took office, Soros-financed groups have been leading a constant effort to thwart the U.S. president’s policies, as this reporter has thoroughly documented.

In one of many examples, tomorrow a coalition of activist groups plans to hold a massive anti-Trump Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations. Unreported by much of the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing.

One Tax March organizer is the recently-formed Indivisible Project, which has been helping to lead anti-Trump activism nationwide. Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by Soros.

Soros reportedly also has ties to more than 50 “partners” of the anti-Trump Women’s March that was held the day after Trump’s inauguration. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ own close associations with Soros.

In February, Breitbart News reported a Soros-financed group distributed an actual script with anti-Trump talking points for citizens to use when meeting with constituents in town halls, including during last week’s Congressional recess.

The script provided word-for-word language suggestions that accuse the Trump administration of “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia.” It asked activists to use the descriptors to petition their representatives to “forcefully condemn” and support legislation opposing Trump’s immigration and border security agendas.

In January, immigration lawyers from groups financed by Soros, a champion of open border policies, were signatories to a lawsuit that successfully blocked Trump’s original executive order halting visas for 90 days for “immigrants and non-immigrants” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq.

While rolling back onerous Obama-era environmental and business regulations, President Donald Trump has also been quietly dropping gun controls which were either put in place or at least prolonged by the Obama administration.

On February 28 Breitbart News reported that Trump signed the repeal of Obama’s Social Security gun ban; a ban which empowered the Social Security administration to strip away the Second Amendment rights of Social Security beneficiaries without due process. Days later, Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke squashed Obama’s lead ammunition ban for federal lands and waters.

According to McClatchy, Trump’s administration has been quietly working to do away with other Obama-era firearm regulations as well.

For example, “agencies narrowed the definition of ‘fugitive&apos;” which, in turn, limits the number of people barred from gun possession because they are included in a fugitive database. Additionally, Trump “officials have also signaled that they may no longer defend the Army Corps of Engineers’ ban on carrying loaded firearms and ammunition on federal lands.”

The repeal of another ban–the Obama-era gun ban for military veterans–is also on the move in Congress, as is the Hearing Protection Act ; an Act which will deregulate firearm suppressors by removing them from the purview of the National Firearms Act (1934). During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump Jr. signaled that his father would sign a bill deregulating firearms if such legislation made it to his desk.

In addition to the things Trump and his administration have done to reduce firearm regulations, one cannot overlook the importance of nominating and securing the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Throughout the campaign Trump pledged to defend the Second Amendment and on October 9, 2016, he promised to nominate a justice would protect gun rights from “ people like Hillary Clinton .”

Trump spoke in favor of the ruling in District of Columbia v Heller (2008) during the presidential campaign and Gorsuch did the same during his confirmation hearings. On April 7 Gorsuch was confirmed by a vote of 54 to 45.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6d96de10:490ad3:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Thursday on KNBC 4’s “News at 11 pm,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said President Donald Trump was “using the military to threaten, to basically almost start a war.”

Water said, “Our Americas should be very concerned about what they see this president doing. He appears to be using the military to threaten, to basically almost start a war. We don’t know what’s going happen over on that peninsula.”

She added, “If he was thinking correctly about this he would want the support of congress but of corse, he doesn’t deserve to be president in the first place.”

The South African edition of left wing media site The Huffington Post has published an opinion piece accusing white men of being a retrograde force in politics and calling for the vote to be withdrawn from the racial gender group as a means to advance the “progressive cause”.

Writing on the potential to run down the political and social influence of “toxic white males” by withdrawing their right to the ballot, Huffington Post contributor Shelley Garland — who describes herself as an “activist and a feminist” student who is “working on ways to smash the patriarchy” —says the change only need be enacted for 20 to 30 years or so. This period would “go some way to seeing a decline in the influence of reactionary and neo-liberal ideology in the world”.

Blaming white males for “Some of the biggest blows to the progressive cause in the past year” including Brexit and the election of President Donald Trump, Garland’s apparently serious piece claimed just a couple of decades of white men being excluded from elections could see such progressive leaps forward as the collapse of Western law and capitalism, and a massive redistribution of wealth from “toxic white masculinity” through “expropriation of these various assets”.

Among the charges laid at the feet of white males by the author are the 2008 recession, and “500 years colonialism, slavery, and various aggressive wars and genocides”.

If this was about any other group it would be the end of @HuffingtonPost Is It Time To Deny #WhiteMen The #Vote ? https://t.co/de5QnvEdgt — Ben Harris-Quinney (@B_HQ) April 13, 2017

The extremely sexist and racist nature of the piece has been noted by many on social media. Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of Britain’s oldest Conservative think tank The Bow Group, took to Twitter to suggest that had the piece targeted any other minority group as opposed to white males, it would “be the end” of the online publication.

Social media users also speculated on the likelihood of Shelley Garland merely being a pseudonym, with some pointing out her lack of presence on the internet besides The Huffington Post. A parody account for Garland created after the article was published joked about the amount of “[white male] tears” shed for the piece, and rejected the notion she was a work of fiction.

Autry Pruitt, board member of FAIRtax.org spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday regarding tax day rallies planned to take place across America, including in front of Trump Tower in NYC.

Said Pruitt, “FAIRtax.org is holding a rally tomorrow and we’re holding the rally to help remind President Trump of what he promised. Our fear after watching the recent events in Syria, our fear after watching what occurred with Obamacare is that President Trump is going to be urged, he’s going to get a push from the media, to turn tax reform over to the establishment.”

“And that’s exactly what we do not want,” he continued. “So, we felt that at this time it is imperative that all the people who voted for him, who’s sweat and I believe your previous guest who talked about having blood coming from their feet as they marched for him, we believe that it’s imperative that we remind President Trump we were there for you. We got you there. When nobody else said you could, we said you can and you will.”

Pruitt also authored a pro-Trump book titled Planes, Steak &amp; Water: Defending Donald J. Trump in September of 2016.

Border Patrol Agent Brandon Judd, speaking in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council, pushed back against House Speaker Paul Ryan’s contention that funding for the border wall can be delayed.

Judd’s comments came during an interview with Fox Business Channel’s Stuart Varney where he addressed the dramatic impact the Trump Administration has already had on reducing illegal border crossings. “Speaker Paul Ryan is suggesting that Congress delay border wall funding until next year,” Varney stated. “What do you say about that?”

“I disagree,” Judd said flatly. “President Trump promised that he was going to secure the border, and part of securing the border is putting in place, the proper technology and resources that allows us to be successful and a border wall in strategic locations is one of those things that we must get done.”

Ryan’s comments that he may delay funding the border wall came during a March interview with Norah O’Donnell on “CBS This Morning”.

“The big chunk of money for the border wall really is next year’s fiscal appropriations,” Ryan said. “Because they literally can’t start construction even this quickly.”

The Trump Administration is moving forward with the bidding process, Breitbart Texas reported. Officials are expected to choose 4 to 10 companies to build a prototype section of wall to demonstrate their bid’s viability and effectiveness. Officials with knowledge of the plan spoke to the Daily Mail on condition of anonymity and said contractors would build the prototypes on a quarter-mile strip of federally-owned land near San Diego.

Trump began seeking bids to build prototypes of the wall in February, Breitbart Texas reported. More than 300 companies quickly signed up to present proposals on how to take the President’s vision and promise to reality.

Two leading advocates for reforming illegal and legal immigration enforcement were appointed by President Donald Trump to serve as senior advisors for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Jon Feere, the former legal analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, and Julie Kirchner, the previous executive director for the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR), have both been appointed to senior positions.

Feere, who work with the Trump campaign and transition team on immigration policy, will serve as the senior adviser to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency Director Thomas Homan.

Kirchner, a campaign alum as well, will serve as the senior adviser to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan.

Center for Immigration Studies Executive Director Mark Krikorian told Breitbart Texas that the Trump Administration appointed a person who “knows the ins and outs” of immigration when they chose Feere to serve.

“ICE needs somebody like Jon because he’s worked on immigration policy for many years,” Krikorian said. “After eight years of Obama, there were civil servants and people at ICE who weren’t as quite up to date on immigration enforcement.”

FAIR spokesperson Ira Mehlman told Breitbart Texas that Kirchner’s appointment is welcome news.

“They’re both people with long experience and deep knowledge and they’re highly qualified for their positions,” Mehlman said.

Both the Center for Immigration Studies and FAIR have long been advocates for increased border security, a wall, reforming foreign guest worker visas and lower levels of legal immigration to help American wages to rise.

The appointments have come with the usual media backlash that the Trump Administration has grown accustomed to.

CNN, for instance, has written that Feere and Kirchner’s appointments have “alarmed” the open borders lobby. The network propped up opposition to the appointments through the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center, with Director Heidi Beirich claiming that that the Center for Immigration Studies and FAIR publish “racist” and “xenophobic” reports.

Krikorian, though, said the open borders lobby is only outraged because they know how effective both nominees could be.

“This isn’t a complaint about qualification,” Krikorian told Breitbart Texas. “Jon and these others know what they’re doing and that’s what the anti-borders groups are afraid of.”

The U.S. military said it had degraded the number of Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) fighters in Afghanistan by an estimated 80 percent to about 600 jihadists before dropping the largest non-nuclear bomb on the terrorist group on Thursday.

“As ISIS-K’s losses have mounted, they are using [improvised bombs], bunkers and tunnels to thicken their defense,” said Army Gen. John W. Nicholson, top commander of U.S. and NATO forces, after the U.S. strike on the jihadist group in Afghanistan.“This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K.”

The Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. military dropped the “mother of all bombs,” officially known as the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, on an Islamic State tunnel complex in Achin district, located in eastern Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, marking the first time the massive 21,600-pound bomb was used in battle.

U.S. military officials have identified eastern Afghanistan’s opium-rich Nangarhar province, located along the country’s border with Pakistan, as the group’s primary stronghold in the region.

ISIS officially established a branch in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, dubbed the Khorasan Province (IS-KP/ISIS-K) in January 2015, less than a month after former President Barack Obama and NATO announced an end to their combat mission in Afghanistan.

The end of combat declaration came with a substantial reduction of coalition forces, allowing the number of ISIS-K fighters to reach 3,000 at its peak.

Last October, Gen. John Nicholson, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, warned that ISIS was intent on establishing a caliphate in the Afghanistan region.

“Right now we see them very focused on trying to establish their caliphate, the Khorasan caliphate, inside Afghanistan,” Gen. Nicholson told NBC News.

However, the U.S. military recently said the group’s manpower has been diminished by an estimated 80 percent, to 600 jihadists.

Most of the ISIS-K jihadists are former members of Pakistani Taliban, or Tehrik-e Taliban, and its Afghan counterpart, according to the Pentagon.

“Our goal in 2017 is to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan,” American Navy Capt. Bill Salvin, a top spokesman for the U.S./NATO-led coalition in Kabul, told Voice of American (VOA) at the end of last month.

“In 2016, we believed that year began with about 3,000 or so ISIS-K members in about 12 districts in southern Nangarhar,” added the captain. “Right now, we believe there are about 600 ISIS-K members in two or three districts in southern Nangarhar.”

The Trump administration has taken steps to combat ISIS-K that appear to be paying off.

President Trump has granted military commanders, including Gen. Nicholson, “broader latitude to act independently,” notes CNN.

Without explicitly saying whether he personally approved Thursday’s strike on ISIS in Afghanistan, Trump declared, “Everybody knows exactly what happens. So, what I do is I authorize our military.”

“We have given them total authorization and that’s what they’re doing,” he added, referring to U.S. commanders.

CNN learned that Gen. Nicholson signed off on the recent strike.

Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman, revealed that the authority to deploy to bomb was granted to Nicholson by Gen. Joseph Votel, the chief of U.S. Central Command.

Khorasan is an ancient name for a region that covers parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, India, and other neighboring countries.

From the Khorasan region, ISIS-K is also positioned to pose a threat to China, which shares a border with Afghanistan.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6d8356ad:49f5ad:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">&apos;What is the strategy?&apos; Sen.

In a clip that aired on Friday’s broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Fox &amp; Friends,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) reacted to a “mother of all bombs” strike on an ISIS stronghold in Afghanistan on Thursday.

Warren told reporters gathered at an appearance in Salem, MA what needed to be made clear was President Donald Trump’s strategy.

“As is the case with every part of Trump’s foreign policy, we are all trying to understand: What is the strategy?” Warren said.

“If we can’t figure out what it means, it’s sort of hard to make that a message,” she added.

After spending days claiming it would welcome United Nations involvement in the Syrian chemical weapons attack, Russia used its veto power on the U.N. Security Council to block a resolution condemning the attack and calling for its perpetrators to be brought to justice.

China abstained from the vote instead of voting “no,” a decision President Donald Trump praised as “wonderful” and a sign of progress in U.S.-Chinese relations since China generally votes with Russia on Syrian affairs.

China’s U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said the resolution could be “amended” into a form China would vote for and said it was his country’s “longstanding hope that the Security Council can speak with one voice on Syria.”

“With its veto, Russia said no to accountability. Russia once again has chosen to side with Assad, even as the rest of the world, overwhelmingly comes together to condemn this murderous regime,” said the American ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.

“You are isolating yourselves from the international community every time one of Assad’s planes drop another barrel bomb on civilians and every time Assad tries to starve another community to death,” Haley told the Russians.

The UK Daily Mail reports on a dramatic confrontation between Russian deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov and British ambassador Matthew Rycroft at the U.N. that reportedly occurred on Wednesday night.

“Time and time again, Russia has abused its veto protect the regime and to defend its use of chemical weapons,” said Rycroft. “What has Russia got in return for its seven vetoes in six years? Russia’s initiative in 2013 to dismantle Syria’s chemical weapons has been exposed as a shambles. Russian pride in the Astana process has been turned to humiliation and Russia’s credibility and reputation across the world have been poisoned by its toxic association with Assad.” The “Astana process” is a reference to Russian-sponsored Syria peace talks held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.

Safronkov exploded in a finger-jabbing rant at Rycroft, claiming that the United Kingdom was trying to undermine improving relations between the United States and Russia.

“You’re losing sleep that we might be working together with the United States, co-operating with the United States. That is what you fear,” Safronkov thundered at the British ambassador. “You’re doing everything to make sure this kind of cooperation is undermined. What have you done to advance a cease-fire? You welcome various opposition groups in London and Paris, illegal armed groups.”

“Don’t you dare insult Russia again,” Safronkov reportedly told Rycroft, accusing him of “irresponsibility” and using “dirty language.” At one point during his tirade, when Rycroft turned his attention elsewhere, the Russian deputy ambassador snapped, “Look at me. Don’t turn your eyes away. Why are you looking away?”

Safronkov explained that the reason Russia vetoed the U.N. resolution was because it “appointed the guilty party prior to the investigation, prior to an independent and objective investigation,” an approach that was “incompatible with the legal norms.”

However, the U.N. resolution did not actually name the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as the perpetrator of the attack. It condemned “the reported use of chemical weapons, in particular the attack on Khan Sheikhoun” and called upon the Syrian government to fully cooperate with an investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

The resolution, which was drafted by Britain, France, and the United States, would have obliged Syria to provide flight plans and details of air operations on the day of the chemical weapons attack, the names of its helicopter squadron commanders, and access to airbases from which the attack might have been launched. This was evidently the provision to which Russia objected most strongly.

Safronkov’s accusation that the U.K. wanted to sabotage relations between Russia and the U.S. might seem odd, given the talk from both Washington and Moscow about how those relations have hit a post-Cold War low, but this is emerging as the official Russian narrative about the current diplomatic tension.

For example, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that the Trump administration is under pressure from “those who want to prevent it from curing the wounds inflicted by Barack Obama’s administration, and are using the Russian card in internal political struggles.”

“It’s deplorable, and we regret what is going on, but we can do little except asking to back accusations with facts,” said Lavrov. “There hasn’t been a single fact, although under the pressure of President Donald Trump’s foes the White House has been forced to periodically make statements containing unfounded accusations against us.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6c85e95e:3265a4:452180c4</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Barack Obama appointed one Republican to his cabinet, and the mainstream media gushed over his “team of rivals,” making effusive comparisons to Abraham Lincoln.

Obama himself boasted that his appointment of opposition party members was “unprecedented.” Politifact rated that claim as “true,” even though one of the “Republicans,” Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, was not registered with any party, and Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) later withdrew his nomination as Secretary of Commerce.

Many presidents appointed more — and more significant — rivals than Obama.

In their new book, JFK and the Reagan Revolution: A Secret History of American Prosperity, Larry Kudlow and Brian Domitrovic note that President John F. Kennedy appointed several Republicans — notably Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon, an unsung hero of that iconic Democratic administration, who first proposed growing the economy by cutting income taxes.

Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin writes in Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln — required reading among Beltway types in 2009 — that Lincoln “resolved … to surround himself with the strongest men from every faction of the new Republican Party,” including former Democrats.

His goal was to boost national unity, minimize external opposition, and have the best talents at his disposal. Most of his appointees were more experienced in government than he, and their supporters were often “violently opposed.”

Obama never lived up to the Lincoln billing. He made Democratic rival Hillary Clinton Secretary of State, but neither she nor Republican Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood ever challenged his policies.

The reality is that the Obama White House was a left-wing monoculture, intolerant of dissent. The few independent-minded staffers left before the 2010 midterms — some reportedly booted by aide Valerie Jarrett and the First Lady.

In their place was a core of junior sycophants who worshipped Obama and did nothing to curb his excesses, even when it was clear he was leading the country into danger and his party into ruin.

Today, President Donald Trump has presented America with a real “team of rivals.”

The media tell us that there are three West Wing factions: one, the “populist nationalist” group, centered around Chief Strategist Steve Bannon; a second, the “establishment” ring, built by Chief of Staff Reince Priebus; and the third, the “Democrats,” connected to Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Yet all three supposed rivals worked together with Kellyanne Conway to produce Trump’s unlikely win in November.

Only Trump could have led a team of such diverse backgrounds, views and talents to victory — and in that sense, the success was uniquely his.

But each was also individually critical to a campaign that highlighted previously marginalized issues; that mobilized the Republican Party despite internal divisions; and that reached into the Democratic base to find new votes.

As Trump’s team turned to the task of governing, journalists — many of whom had bet on Trump losing — have set about magnifying, and inventing, internal differences.

Conservatives, too, who have always been nervous about Trump’s pragmatism, have begun to worry that some of his staff choices mean he will flip-flop on core issues — even though his performance in office has been largely consistent with what he promised his voters he would do.

The White House has tried to calm those fears — sending Bannon and Priebus out together at CPAC, for example — but the stories have only intensified.

Not all of the reporting has been agenda-driven. Some of it reflects the fact that Beltway journalists rarely face the challenge of working with people who disagree with them, and cannot fathom that anyone would relish the opportunity. Moreover, Trump’s own leadership style has famously prized internal competition as a form of motivation.

Regardless, understanding the Trump White House requires a sense of historical perspective. This is the first non-politician Americans have elected president. Moreover, he comes from a business world that emphasizes results, and measures them in brick and steel, not column inches.

Trump made key personnel concessions to conservatives, particularly on judges. Beyond that, he said he would hire whomever was best for the job, regardless of party. Unlike his predecessors, he seems to have meant it.

Those closest to Trump have praised the political diversity of his staff. It takes a certain maturity to be able to work with others with whom one may have profound disagreements.

When I am asked what it was like to work with Steve Bannon at Breitbart News, for example, that is what I emphasize — that we managed through all kinds of arguments, under pressure.

Trump’s “team of rivals” is likely here to stay, and America will be the better for it.

As Goodwin notes of Lincoln:

While it was possible that his team of rivals would devour one another, Lincoln determined that “he must risk the dangers of faction to overcome the dangers of rebellion.” … “We needed the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.”

Lincoln’s White House endured conflicts, reshuffles and resignations — even rumors that Secretary of State William H. Seward was really running the country.

Lincoln made better decisions, and he became stronger, because of that internal turmoil.

Without comparing Trump to Lincoln, we may compare ourselves to the Americans of that day. Do we have the same patience to endure the fleeting ups and downs of West Wing rivalries, for the sake of a higher cause?

If not, why not?

An Indian-heritage woman doctor is facing a lifetime jail sentence for allegedly helping immigrant Somali mothers cut the genitalia from their two American seven-year-old daughters, and federal officials have promised to wipe out the imported practice which threatens more than half a million American girls and women.

“The Department of Justice is committed to stopping female genital mutilation in this country, and will use the full power of the law to ensure that no girls suffer such physical and emotional abuse,” the acting Assistant Attorney General of the justice department’s criminal division, Kenneth Blanco, said April 13.

“Female genital mutilation constitutes a particularly brutal form of violence against women and girls,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Lemisch said in a statement. “The practice has no place in modern society,” he claimed.

However, that practice of “Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting” already has a large place in newly diverse America.

“In slightly more than two decades, from 1990 to 2012, the total number of women and girls in the United States at risk for FGM/C or its consequences increased by 224%, from 168,000 to 545,000,” according to an government research report in the March/April 2016 issue of Public Health Reports.

The number is high because officials counted the number of daughters of immigrants from African and Arab population countries where small or complete FGM/C is considered healthy and morally good, and is endorsed by orthodox Islamic preachers and texts, largely because it is intended to clip the daughters’ sexual desire.

The estimate of real and possible victims is broad because researchers could not directly count the number of wounded girls. Instead, the researchers counted the number of daughters of immigrants from African and Arab population countries where FGM is considered healthy and good. If the number is only 1-in-five of endangers daughters, then the number American girls with sliced genitals would reach 100,000, which would give the immigrant practice a prominent “place in modern society.”

If only one-in-five of endangered daughters are forced to undergo surgery, then the number of American girls with sliced genitals would reach 100,000.

In the United Kingdom, medical professionals discovered another 5,000 girls with mutilated genitals during 2017. The practice is now broadly accepted in the diverse United Kingdom, which has conducted no prosecutions against parents since the practice was formally banned in 1985.

In the United States, the practice is endorsed by orthodox Muslim clerics at the dominant Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America. For example, a Muslim cleric and doctor urged fellow Muslim in 2006 to “circumcise” their daughters.

The question is not to ban female circumcision because of the position of certain nations, but How do we regulate it as Muslims? Most of the problem and the bad publicity stem from the fact that, not infrequently, unqualified people perform the procedure and they may do more harm than good. If it was left to the specialists, it wouldn`t have been misused and wouldn`t have gotten such bad publicity. So, it is essential that the medical doctors be trained in the procedure and become the only ones permitted to do it. The surgeon will then judiciously remove what needs to be removed … We however should never doubt anything in our religion because of the bad publicity the media creates about it.

The author of that Islamic advice later quit the Mayo Clinic.

An increasing number of foreign doctors are being imported into the United States from countries where FGM/C is normal, partly because the federal government underfunds training for Americans who want to become doctors. On April 11, for example, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar filed a bill that would increase the states’ reliance on imported doctors.

DoJ and FBI officials declined to identify the culture or religion beliefs of the two mothers and the doctor. Instead, they merely said the people involved are from “a particular religion and cultural community.”

In the Detroit, case, Dr. Jumana Nagarwala’s parents come from a Muslim community in Northern India. She earned her medical degree with American doctors at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1998, and she displays her allegiance by wearing an Islamic head-covering. In Detroit, she worked at the Henry Ford Medical Group.

In her conversations with the FBI, Nagarwala denied performing any FGM operations.

The two victimized girls were allegedly brought by their mothers to Detroit from Klobuchar’s state, which includes a large and growing Muslim population from Somalia, and is the state with the third largest number of vulnerable girls. The 2016 study says that roughly 17,000 American girls in Minnesota aged under 18, plus 27,000 adult women, are “potentially at risk for FGM/C.”

The DoJ complaint says that additional victims have been found in Michigan:

This investigation has identified other children who may have been victimized by NAGARWALA between and 2005 and 2007, including children in Michigan. On April 10, 2017, local Child Protective Services personnel and child forensic interviewers employed by the FBI and HSI interviewed several minor girls in Michigan about FGM. In these interviews, multiple minor girls informed Child Protective Services and forensic interviewers that procedures had been performed on their genitals by NAGARWALA … Two parents stated that NAGARWALA had performed procedures on their daughter’s genitals, while others denied knowledge of the procedure or said that it did not happen.

There is no evidence that Americans welcome this additional example of cultural diversity, alongside other imported problems of Muslim attacks, immigrant crime, extensive welfare use by immigrants, and civic fragmentation.

In November, public opposition to these diversity trends helped candidate Donald Trump break through the Democrats’ blue wall in Michigan and other Midwestern states.

A July 2016 poll, for example, showed midwestern voters more concerned about the impact of immigration than any other region In the Midwest, 54 percent said immigration was a burden, while 29 percent said it was a benefit, creating a 25-point gap in favor of Trump’s pro-American policies on immigration.

After the election, Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg helped midwestern voters reveal their silent concerns about the civic and economic costs of mass immigration. According to Greenberg’s memo, the voters say their supportive civic culture is being fragmented by the influx of diverse foreign and especially Islamic migrants:

The [voters] are living with a growing number of Muslim immigrants from the Middle East and Dearborn is home to one of the biggest Muslim communities in the United States. That changing demography emerged powerfully in discussions of immigration among the working class women … Cathy: Although we’re all different. You know, we all have groups, but it does seem as though like there’s still separation – Instead of a community, that this isn’t happening… [Another person said] “It’s not necessarily the people. It’s the religion and what they were taught. They were taught evil, evil things…it’s that they know any better. So, when you’re taught that, it’s embedded in your mind. Just like I’m Catholic and I believe in, you know, the Virgin Mary and God and everything else. But, they’re not telling me to rape 9-year-olds or to kill, you know, bomb citizens. And it’s what they were taught. So, why, if they would do it there, why wouldn’t they do it here?”… A majority of the Trump voters in our groups joined in the exchanges lamenting the growing foreignness, concerns about Islam and whether immigrants assimilate in ways that suggested a deeper set of attitudes on diversity, foreignness, and comfort with change … Immigrants and religion were central to the deep feelings about how America was changing, but black-white relations were just barely part of the discussion.

During his campaign, Trump repeatedly showcased the victims of crime by illegal immigrants, which helped to build an emotional bond with critical blue-collar voters who feel rejected by D.C. elites. Since his inauguration, President Trump has directed officials to collate and release information about crime by illegal immigrants, prompting the creation of a new D.C.-based group to help publicize the toll of crimes.

On Thursday, the FBI joined with the FBI in promising to wipe out the FGM crime.

“The allegations detailed in today’s criminal complaint are disturbing,” Special Agent in Charge David Gelios said. “The FBI, along with its law enforcement partners, are committed to doing whatever necessary to bring an end to this barbaric practice and to ensure no additional children fall victim to this procedure.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6c51d99b:2af0ee:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

I have no doubt that President Barack Obama was well-intentioned when, rather than enforcing his “red line” in August of 2013 after Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad gassed to death more than 1000 innocent Arabs, he chose not to attack Assad but to forge an ultimately fraudulent deal to remove Assad’s chemical weapons instead.

But intentions don’t count when it comes to mass murder. You either take action or you don’t. And President Obama chose not to. Obama’s inaction will forever stain his legacy.

I have noted elsewhere that April 7, the day in Syria when Trump launched his retaliatory attack, was the commemoration of the Rwandan genocide. More than 800,000 people were hacked to death in three months in 1994. The world watched in silence as the Tutsis were dismembered.

President Bill Clinton did not lift a finger to help them, and in 1998 he traveled to Rwanda to apologize. His words, as usual, were eloquent. But surely the people of Rwanda would have preferred mistaken comments by Clinton’s press secretary matched by action to stop the slaughter, rather than an eloquent apology that was too little, too late.

Trump and his people may not have found all the right words in defending their attack on Assad. Press Secretary Sean Spicer certainly did not. But when it comes to combatting genocide, words are trivial and action is everything. I am grateful to Sean Spicer and the members of the Trump team for taking action to give value to innocent Arab life.

For the past two days, I was in a news blackout due to the Passover holiday. The festival ended, and I saw that my inbox was filled with media asking me to comment on Spicer’s remarks about Hitler, poison gas, and the Holocaust. As a rabbi, I cannot broadcast on any Jewish holy day. But I felt Spicer deserved defending after his apology, so here goes.

Hitler was the most evil man that ever lived. He gassed, shot, and burned six million Jews and started wars that led so the deaths of approximately 100 million people. He was a monster the likes of which the world has never seen. No one should be compared to Hitler.

But it is also true that Hitler is the godfather of all modern genocide, and all those who attempt the extermination of an ethnic group are Hitler’s ideological stepchildren. True, genocide did not start with Hitler, but with the Ottoman Turks and their mass murder of the Armenians during World War I — a genocide that the amoral world still barely recognizes. But Hitler has become mass murder’s symbol, and was responsible for the most far-reaching and all-encompassing genocide of all time.

Spicer is right to point out Assad’s relationship with Hitler, since the Syrian butcher is attempting a genocide of Sunni Muslims in Syria carried out by Alawite militias, Shia Iran, and Hezbollah (which is also Shia). All of that has been aided and abetted by Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Spicer is also correct to point out that the use of nerve agents against one’s own people is a unique form of evil from which Assad can now never escape.

Assad should be removed because no man who gasses his people must ever be allowed to stay in power.

Where Spicer was absolutely wrong was when he said that Hitler had not used chemical gas against his own people, given that Hitler murdered something in the region of 200,000 German Jews during the Holocaust — not to mention the millions of others who were gassed at Birkenau, Belzec, Treblinka, Bergen-Belsen, and so many other camps.

I understand what Spicer was trying to say — namely, that there were areas where Assad was even worse than Hitler, insofar as the Damascus butcher used chemical gas on the battlefield, something, interestingly, which Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany used in World War I but the Wehrmacht seemed not to have used in battlefield conditions in the Second World War.

Yet Spicer was wrong because all of Europe was a battlefield during that war, and the gas chambers where 1.5 million Jewish children met their end was history’s most horrible use ever of chemical agents in war.

But Spicer apologized — and, it seems, he did so sincerely, much regretting his mistake. He deserves to be forgiven and we should move on.

Those who wrote blogs calling Spicer an antisemite are guilty of character assassination and debasing the term. The Jews have real enemies in the world. Sean Spicer has used his pulpit at the White House repeatedly to defend the Jewish State and condemn genocidal Iran. He should be considered a friend of the Jewish people.

What is far more important to me, as a member of a people who experienced genocide, is that the Trump administration decided to reverse course from previous American inaction at the gassing of Syrian children, and strike hard at the Assad regime, showing them that Never Again must mean just that, Never Again.

For nearly four years we watched as America became a toothless tiger in relation to Syria, forever huffing and puffing but never striking at Assad for the use of nerve agents against kids. Surely even the biggest Trump haters must applaud the president for his honorable action at striking back at the beast.

The crime of the Holocaust is unique in world history. It brooks no comparisons. But genocides of any stripe are humanity’s highest abomination, and poison gas is poison gas. America had a moral responsibility to hit the Assad regime for dropping sarin gas on children. And nothing that can be said about that action will ever be as important as the action itself. To see Syrian jets smoldering in ruins at the hands of the American military is to take just pride in being citizens of the most righteous nation on earth.

Many of the memoirs of Auschwitz survivors relate how the prisoners prayed daily that they might see American bombers punishing the SS for operating the gas chambers at Birkenau. They prayed even though they knew that such bombing runs would cost them their own lives. But the bombers never came, thereby forever staining the legacies of even truly great men like Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, who ultimately defeated Hitler.

It’s time to applaud and thank President Trump and his administration, Spicer included, for taking decisive action in Syria to save Arab life. Because only action, and not words, are that which will ensure that Never Again means Never Again.

In his lengthy interview with AFP on Thursday, Syrian President Bashar Assad mused that the American “Deep State” was more responsible for pelting his Sharyat airbase with 59 cruise missiles than President Donald Trump.

When the interviewer proposed that the retaliatory missile strike marked a drastic change in Trump’s position on Syria, Assad insisted the U.S. and Syria could still be partners in fighting terrorism, once Trump wrested control of Washington away from the military-industrial complex.

“If they are serious in fighting terrorists, we’re going to be partners, and I said not only the United States. Whoever wants to fight the terrorists, we are partners,” said Assad, in the transcript provided by Syria’s SANA news service.

“This is basic for us, basic principle, let’s say,” he continued:

Actually, what has been proven recently, as I said earlier, that they are hand in glove with those terrorists, the United States and the West, they’re not serious in fighting the terrorists, and yesterday some of their statesmen were defending ISIS. They were saying that ISIS doesn’t have chemical weapons. They are defending ISIS against the Syrian government and the Syrian Army. So, actually, you cannot talk about partnership between us who work against the terrorists and who fight the terrorism and the others who are supporting explicitly the terrorists.

Assad said the American missile strike was “the first proof that it’s not about the President of the United States — it’s about the regime and the Deep State, or the deep regime in the United States.”

He said the Deep State “is still the same, it doesn’t change.”

“The president is only one of the performers on their theatre, if he wants to be a leader, he cannot, because as some say he wanted to be a leader, Trump wanted to be a leader, but every president there, if he wants to be a real leader, later he’s going to eat his words, swallow his pride if he has pride at all, and make a 180 degree U-turn, otherwise he would pay the price politically,” said Assad.

Asked if he anticipated another U.S. attack, Assad replied:

As long as the United States is being governed by this military-industrial complex, the financial companies, banks, and what you call deep regime, and works for the vested interest of those groups, of course. It could happen anytime, anywhere, not only in Syria.

Assad lamented that his military could not retaliate against the American ships that fired cruise missiles at Syria but expressed hope the Russians might do it for him.

“For us, as a small country, yeah, of course it is, everybody knows that. It’s out of reach. I mean, they can have missiles from another continent. We all know that. They are a great power, we’re not a great power. Talking about the Russians, this is another issue,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6a618b8e:a610a:b960d699</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump reversed himself Wednesday on the leadership of the Federal Reserve and the fate of the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said that was open to the possibility of renominating Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen once her current term of office expires next year. During the campaign he was critical of Yellen, describing her as “political” for keeping rates low, and said that he “most likely” would replace her as Fed chief.

“I like her, I respect her,” Trump said. He added that “it’s very early.”

When asked if Yellen was “toast,” the president said, “No. Not toast.”

This has caught many on Wall Street and Capitol Hill by surprise, overturning the near universal expectation that Trump would pick a new head for the central bank. The possibility that Trump may support the status quo at the Fed has some supporters scratching their heads. On Wall Street, this is widely viewed as the result of the influence of Gary Cohn and other financiers on the president.

“I think we’re seeing the influence of guys like Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin and Steve Schwarzman. They probably explained that markets want him to show he’s open-minded about the Fed and favors a dovish stance,” said one investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

“Dovish” is Wall Street lingo for leaning toward keeping interest rates lower.

“I do like a low-interest rate policy, I must be honest with you,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal in response to questions about Yellen.

Cohn is Trump’s chief economic adviser and holds the position of director of the National Economic Council. A lifelong Democrat, Cohn was the number 2 man in charge of Goldman Sachs until he left to join the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is also a Goldman alum and has close ties to Wall Street. Schwarzman is a long-time friend of Trump’s and the co-founder of the Blackstone Group, a deep-pocketed Wall Street private equity firm. He reportedly speaks to Trump by phone several times a week and was recently seated beside Trump at a White House gathering of corporate chiefs.

Trump also said he no longer opposes the Ex-Im bank, which he accused of “feather-bedding” and called unnecessary during the campaign.

“It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal.

Around 40 percent of Ex-Im money is used to subsidize exports from Boeing. Less than 20 percent goes directly to small businesses. The language Trump used, referring to small businesses as ‘vendors’ indicates the influence of big businesses that benefit from Ex-Im subsidies. They have long argued that they pass along subsidies to smaller businesses that manufacture parts for their exports, a trickle-down theory of subsidies.

“Ex-Im doesn’t help the economy. It doesn’t drain the swamp,” writes long-time Ex-Im critic Tim Carney at the Washington Examiner.

Jeff Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, applauded Trump’s change of heart on Ex-Im.

By supporting the Export Import Bank @POTUS is showing great leadership and focusing on creating jobs for American manufacturers. — Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) April 13, 2017

On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer stated that he welcomes President Trump’s recent foreign policy moves, particularly the Syria strike, because “I’m not an America Firster. I thought it was a mistake to enunciate a doctrine in the Inaugural Address which is, we’re coming home.”

Krauthammer said, “[T]he strike on Syria was not something that is a tweak or a slight deviation from what he ran on. … And the reason it is a radical departure is because, in the Inaugural Address he defines national interests very narrowly, and here, what we are back to is the traditional American understanding of national interests as a broad definition, going all the way back to Harry Truman, in which we define our interest as worldwide, otherwise, what is Syria to us?”

He added, “I welcome this. I’m not an America Firster. I thought it was a mistake to enunciate a doctrine in the Inaugural Address which is, we’re coming home. It scared the bee-jeebies out of our allies in NATO, when he talked about it being obsolete. It scared — in the Middle East, the Gulf Arabs were scared to death. I think this is reassuring that we are returning to the classic American definition, where we include our allies, and, most important, we accept world leadership in a way that had not been accepted by Obama, and seemed to be not accepted by Trump the candidate.”

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Wednesday, President Trump elaborated on a Twitter comment that he offered Chinese President Xi Jinping a “far better” trade deal if China “solves the North Korean problem.”

“You want to make a great deal? Solve the problem in North Korea,” Trump recalled saying to Xi during their meeting last week. “That’s worth having deficits. And that’s worth having not as good a trade deal as I would normally be able to make.”

“You cannot allow a country like that to have nuclear power, nuclear weapons,” Trump said of North Korea to the Wall Street Journal. “That’s mass destruction. And he doesn’t have the delivery systems yet, but you know he will.”

Trump stressed that he told Xi he would not allow the United States to continue running “hundreds of billions of dollars a year” in trade deficits with China, even if he sweetened the deal to secure Beijing’s cooperation on the North Korean crisis. He spoke of having a “very open dialogue on North Korea” with his Chinese counterpart.

The New York Times is glum about the odds of getting China to solve the North Korean problem with any combination of carrots and sticks:

Only China, with its vast economic leverage over its reclusive neighbor, can realistically force a change in the behavior of North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong-un. Yet despite its own rising frustration with Mr. Kim, the Chinese government has so far been unwilling to tighten the vise on him. President Xi Jinping of China did not offer Mr. Trump any public commitments on North Korea or trade when they held their first meeting last week at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s club in Palm Beach, Fla. Even in private conversations, officials said, the Chinese leader was noncommittal.

The NYT quotes one of President Obama’s China advisers, Evan S. Medeiros, saying that Trump was “clearly groping for leverage over China” but linking the two issues won’t work. Even if it does, Medeiros warned that “linkage can also be counterproductive by reinforcing China’s worst instincts.”

Trump brought up China and North Korea during his press conference on Thursday after the dropping of a massive “Mother of All Bombs” on Islamic State positions in Afghanistan.

Asked if the Afghanistan bomb drop would send a message to North Korea, Trump replied, “I don’t know if this sends a message. It doesn’t make any difference if it does or not. North Korea is a problem. The problem will be taken care of.”

“I will say, I think China has really been working very hard. I have really gotten to like and respect, as you know, President Xi. He’s a terrific person. We spent a lot of time together in Florida. And he’s a very special man. So we’ll see how it goes. I think he’s going to try very hard,” Trump added.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6a618b8e:a6106:b960d699</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A student at the University of South Alabama is taking heat from administrators for failing to remove a Donald Trump sign from the window of his dorm room.

Student William David Meredith has been threatened with disciplinary action by administrators over his refusal to remove a Donald Trump campaign sign from the window of his dorm room.

“I am asking that you remove the sign within 24 hours. I have included your RA, Tiffany, on this email so that she can check to ensure it is gone within 24 hours,” Community Director Dylan Lloyd wrote in an email, to which Meredith replied by simply stating: “1st Amendment.”

Although Lloyd acknowledged that Meredith does have first amendment protections on the public university’s campus, he countered by arguing that federal buildings cannot display endorsements of political candidates.

“The policy you’ve quoted pertains to political candidates, which President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are not,” Meredith argued. “Nothing on it says anything about campaigning and his campaign is over, which makes it memorabilia not campaign material.”

“While I understand that, it still shows that the university supports a particular candidate,” Lloyd fired back in response. “While we are not actively in campaign season, Trump will run for reelection in four years. The sign makes it look like the university supports Trump as a candidate.”

Meredith held firmly that no reasonable person would consider a sign in a student’s window to be an institutional endorsement of a political candidate. “No reasonable person would see a sign in a dorm room window and presume that the university is endorsing that message,” Alliance Defending Freedom Legal Counsel Travis Barham said in a statement.

“The Supreme Court has long recognized that a university does not endorse everything on campus that it fails to censor,” he explained, noting that “in 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that even elementary school students could understand this, saying ‘[t]he proposition that schools do not endorse everything they fail to censor is not complicated’ [Bd. of Educ. of Westside Cmty. Sch. v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250 (1990)].”

Despite this, administrators maintained that Meredith would be disciplined by the university if he refused to remove the sign from his window.

“If you are found responsible for violating policies, administrative sanctions will most likely be determined at the conclusion of the hearing, even if you do not attend,” an email from an administrator stated, asserting that Meredith “will be required to comply with all sanctions administrated [sic] as a result of the findings.”

Ultimately, the school’s Executive Director of Marketing and Communications Michael Haskins confirmed that Meredith would be able to keep his sign up in his window, citing a misunderstanding on the university policy on behalf on the staff members who originally took issue with the sign.

President Trump recently threatened to withhold Obamacare subsidies, a move that would tank Obamacare in many states and force Democrats to strike a deal on fixing health care.

In an interview in the Oval Office, President Trump signaled that he might consider withholding payments to insurers. Obama pushed for these payments to insurance companies to stabilize the Obamacare exchanges, although conservatives contend that the insurance handouts are unconstitutional. The absence of the health subsidies could cause the collapse of Obamacare, forcing lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to strike a deal.

The Obamacare subsidies reduce co-payments and deductibles for health insurers to lower the costs associated with low-income Obamacare recipients.

Trump reiterated his commitment to repealing Obamacare, saying, “I’m going to get health care done.”

Although Trump believes that repealing the Obamacare subsidies will force a deal between Republicans and Democrats, he remains concerned about creating turbulence in the market. Trump said, “Obamacare is dead next month if it doesn’t get that money.” He continued, “I haven’t made my viewpoint clear yet. I don’t want people to get hurt …What I think should happen and will happen is the Democrats will start calling me and negotiating.”

Conservatives argue that Obama lacked the authority to dole out billions of dollars of insurance subsidies, arguing that Congress never appropriated money for that purpose. Under former Speaker John Boehner, House Republicans sued the Obama administration to prevent it from doling out the subsidies.

In 2016 a federal judge ruled against the Obama administration but allowed the Obama White House to continue providing Obamacare subsidies while the administration appealed the decision. Republicans sought to delay the court case after Trump was elected president.

Trump said, “It wasn’t authorized by Congress; I’m going to have to make a decision.”

Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said he would prefer the administration continue funding the payments.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader (D-CA) signaled that they would be unwilling to discuss a deal with President Trump that would undermine the efficacy of Obamacare. Schumer said that Trump was “threatening to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans…to achieve a political goal of repeal that would take health care away from millions more. This cynical strategy will fail.”

State insurance markets face increasing volatility. Humana announced in February that it will drop out of Obamacare exchanges in 2018. Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini declared that Obamacare is “in a death spiral,” and suggested they may withdraw from Obamacare exchanges entirely. Anthem announced that they might exit a large number of Obamacare exchanges next year.

After Ryancare failed to garner enough votes in the House, Trump tweeted that Democrats will come around to make a deal with him once Obamacare implodes.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6a618b8e:a60fb:b960d699</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Thursday on Newsmax TV discussing President Donald Trump’s positions on NATO and China, which some have argued is a departure from his campaign messaging, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said, “I think he’s learning the job.”

McConnell said, “I think President Trump is learning the job and some of the things that were said during the campaign I think he now knows that’s simply not the way things ought to be.”

He continued, “There is nothing wrong with the president. In fact, I welcome adjustments that he makes from the campaign. A lot of things are said in the campaign by candidates that turn out to be not the way it works when you are actually in office.”

He added, “I can’t think of a single candidate who hasn’t changed their mind once being elected president.”

On the eve of the dropping a massive 21,600-pound bomb in Afghanistan targeting Islamic State (ISIS) fighters from Iraq and Syria hiding in an underground network in that country, Trump announced on Wednesday he is sending National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster there to assess the situation for troops on the ground.

Trump made the announcement during a press conference on Wednesday with North Atlantic Trade Organization (NATO) Secretary General Jans Stoltenberg, as reported by Military Times.

The U.S. has been at war in Afghanistan since 2001, after the September 11 attacks by radical Islamic terrorists on U.S. soil that killed 3,000 people.

The U.S. has some 8,400 troops in Afghanistan, with an additional 5,000 deployed from NATO allies, Business Insider reported. Army Gen. John Nicholson told Congress in February he needed a “few thousand” more troops in order to break what he called a “stalemate” with the Taliban terrorists.

“Of about 400 districts in Afghanistan, the Taliban controls, contests, or influences 171 of them, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction,” Business Insider reported.

Voice of America (VOA) reported last month that the U.S. military in Afghanistan is ratcheting up the offense against the growing Islamic State branch in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.

“Since he took office, President Donald Trump has been ramping up military operations against both the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, as well as al-Qaeda, particularly in Yemen,” VOA reported.

“We stand confident that the new U.S. administration under President Trump will remain strategically engaged and continue its support,” Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Salahuddin Rabbani said at an appearance at the Atlantic Council in Washington.

American Navy Capt. Bill Salvin, the spokesperson and director of public affairs for the U.S./NATO-led coalition in Kabul, told VOA that “our goal in 2017 is to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan.”

Green Beret Staff Sgt. Mark De Alencar, 37, of Edgewood, Maryland, was killed earlier this month fighting jihadists in the eastern part of Afghanistan near the Pakistani border.

The fatality brings the total number of U.S. military deaths since the war started more than 15 years ago to at least 2,249, most of which occurred under former President Barack Obama’s watch, according to Pentagon data.

This marks the first time the bomb, known as the GBU-43, or “Massive Ordnance Air Blast,” (MOAB) was used in combat. Its yield is 11 tons of TNT and has been nicknamed the “Mother of All Bombs.”

It remains uncertain so far if the bombing was planned under the Obama administration or the Trump administration.

Pentagon spokesman Adam Stump said the plan has been in place for a “few months,” and that the weapon had been in Afghanistan for “some time.”

The final test of the MOAB took place on March 11, 2003 and was delivered into theater on April 1, 2003.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b69a0b3d2:11ea5c6:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton talked about North Korea, Russia, and Syria during his regular visit to Breitbart News Daily on Thursday.

Bolton said Trump was correct to see Syria’s use of chemical weapons as a threat to the United States.

“I think this has been a view that has developed in the United States for a hundred years,” he observed. “You know, we’re just past the hundredth anniversary of America’s entry into World War I. It was the use of poison gas in World War I that caused people to begin to think about what we now call weapons of mass destruction. It didn’t happen overnight, but today, we include in that category nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and biological weapons. It’s been a consistent, and I think correct, policy of the United States for decades to prevent the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction and to oppose their use, particularly against innocent civilians.”

“This attack by the Syrians was as much an act of terrorism as it was an act of military action,” he declared.

As for policing the use of WMD, Bolton pointed out that “nobody else is going to do it, anywhere in the world, let’s not kid ourselves.”

“Not the United Nations, not the European Union, certainly not Russia or China, who are, by the way, themselves likely violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. We did it, and we did it because we’re going to make it clear that you don’t use weapons of mass destruction,” he said.

“I think it was a precise and limited rationale and a very precise strike,” he judged. “I think it has almost no implications for the conflict in Syria, the civil war there.”

“Now, I know in the past four or five days since the attack, those who advocate more U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war have said there’s a dramatic change in policy, and they’re in favor of it. Many who oppose greater U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war have said it’s a dramatic change in policy, and they oppose it. They’re all wrong. I don’t think this is a change of policy with respect to Syria. I think it’s about weapons of mass destruction,” he said.

SiriusXM host Alex Marlow brought up the rumors that President Trump ordered the Syria strike as an “emotional response” by members of the Trump family to photos and videos of chemical attack victims, especially the children.

“I don’t think you should respond to strategic threats with an emotional response,” said Bolton. “I know that sounds cold-blooded to some people, but I think that’s the reality that the commander-in-chief has to face. I don’t know exactly what the role of the president’s family was in persuading him to do this.”

“I would say we would test that over the next several weeks,” he proposed. “For example, many who want greater U.S. involvement on the side of the opposition, the rebels in Syria, have said, ‘Well, what difference does it make if Assad uses chemical weapons to kill innocent men, women, and children one day and uses cluster bombs or barrel bombs the next day? The people are just as dead.’ That’s an argument that says once you see an atrocity – and Secretary of State Tillerson said that we’ll come to the protection of innocents all over the world.”

“I said before, strategic analysis can be cold-blooded. It’s certainly the case that the victims of these attacks are just as dead, no matter what the methods used. But I would say there is a strategic difference and a real difference for the United States whether the brutality is carried out by conventional means or by weapons of mass destruction,” said Bolton.

“We are not going to stop all brutality around the world. I think it’s inherent in human nature, among other reasons,” he acknowledged. “But we can say with this category of weapon – biological, chemical, and nuclear – they are different. They’re different because of their capacity to kill in large numbers and the nature of the regimes that use them.”

“This is a complex subject. I can’t prove this moment that the president’s going to stick to the line that he articulated or that maybe there will be an emotional response after another Syrian attack or an attack by somebody else. But I can say where we are right now on this retaliatory action against Syria’s use of chemical weapons, I think we’re right where we should be,” he contended.

Marlow noted that many of Trump’s voters disagree with traditional Republican foreign policy by failing to see even a heinous deployment of chemical weapons in distant lands as a direct threat to the United States.

“I think that the efforts we’ve made over the years to prevent the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction demonstrates why we think it is a threat to the United States,” Bolton countered. “We don’t want more countries to have nuclear weapons. We don’t want more countries to have chemical and biological weapons.”

“Some people say there’s a huge difference between chem and bio on one side and nuclear on the other. Never forget that analysts call chemical and biological weapons ‘the poor man’s atomic bomb’ because it takes an awful lot less to create those kinds of weapons than the nuclear side,” he pointed out.

“There have been technological reasons that it’s been hard to use chemical and biological weapons because when you deliver them via artillery shell, the explosive force of the shell destroys much of the weapon – which is why more sophisticated techniques are now being used, using ventilation systems at domed stadiums, for example, or large office buildings and that sort of thing. Put the chemical or biological weapon in the ventilation system and let it reach tens of thousands of people that way,” he said.

“Don’t underestimate the extent to which terrorists and others would love to perfect these weapons to use against us,” Bolton warned. “In the caves of Afghanistan, in al-Qaeda’s files, we found after the overthrow of the Taliban that al-Qaeda had been pursuing weapons of mass destruction almost from its inception. I think saying to everybody, ‘Don’t even think about using these weapons’ ultimately safeguards the United States more than anybody else because of our presence all around the world.”

Bolton said it was difficult to have complete confidence that Trump’s strike on Syria would be a “one-off” action with no implications for deeper involvement but added that “as of now, when you listen to the president, his rationale has been very limited and very precise.”

“It is true that some of his senior advisers have been much more expansive in what they’re saying and have given the indication that they would like nothing more than to get further military activity underway,” he acknowledged.

“I thought perhaps the most disturbing thing that I heard yesterday at the press conference in Moscow between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was an observation that Lavrov made. I just want to say, for all the obvious reasons that you and your listeners can understand, I don’t want to be in a public spitting contest with Rex Tillerson, but I would say this if Mother Teresa had made this comment,” Bolton said.

“Lavrov said that Rex Tillerson told him he didn’t care about history; he just wanted to solve the current problems that we have. I hate to say I agree with Lavrov, but he went on to say you can’t solve today’s problems unless you understand the history. This temptation to say, ‘Well, the new guys are here. We’re the pros from Dover. We know how to do it. We’ll take care of it’ is a risk, a risk of expanded activity without a strategic rationale behind it,” he cautioned.

“I think what we’ve got now is, we’re in the right place, and I think the president should hear from his supporters the positive reinforcement that we understand the rationale for the strike against Syria, that we support it, and we think it’s just fine to stop there,” he said.

Bolton sought to avoid hyperbole in describing the dismal state of relations between the United States and Russia.

“In the midst of the politics that we found ourselves the last eight months, where after forty years of finding it difficult to stand up to the Soviet threat, the Democrats pretended to be the only defenders of America against the Manchurian candidacy run by Moscow that would convey Donald Trump into the White House, where he would do their bidding,” he observed sarcastically.

Bolton speculated that Trump “feels that Russian complicity, quite possibly, in this chemical weapons attack, certainly Russian efforts to cover it up after the fact through disinformation, have made it impossible for him to do what he hoped to do, which is see if he could better relations.”

“Of course, he’s frustrated by that. I think anybody would be. I’m not so frustrated by it in the sense I fully expected it. Part of assuming the office is learning in a very personal sense some hard truths out there,” he said.

Bolton found more hard truths to be learned in North Korea, where he said there was no doubt that “because of eight years of the Obama administration doing nothing, under the guise of a policy they called ‘strategic patience,’ which was really a synonym for doing nothing, North Korea is perilously close to having the capability to put a nuclear device under the nose cone of an ICBM and land it on the United States.”

“There is interesting testimony, I think it was just last week, by the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, who said that of all the things you need to do to have a worldwide ballistic missile delivery capability for nuclear weapons that he doesn’t think the North Koreans have is the miniaturization issue – taking the nuclear device and putting it in a small enough package that it can actually be delivered via missile,” Bolton said.

“Since we know that Russia and China both obviously mastered that a long time ago, you have to worry that the North may be even closer than we thought,” he continued. “The estimates were they were close to that point, people said, within a few years. There are people at the Pentagon, serious people, who believe that it could be 2018. That’s why I think there’s real concern about what’s going on.”

“I think it’s coupled with the disarray in South Korea, where they’ve just had their president impeached – an election coming up next month that could return a left-wing administration, which would be a real problem for us. So I think there’s good reason to be concerned,” he added.

“You ask what the long-term solution is. I believe this: North Korea will never be talked out of its nuclear weapons – not by diplomacy, not be economic pressure. People in North Korea live a prison camp now. The regime doesn’t care about their economic well-being. They care about staying in power. A nuclear weapon is the regime’s ace in the hole to stay in power,” he contended.

“I think the only long-term way to deal with the North Korean nuclear weapons program is to end the regime in North Korea,” Bolton advised. “Reunite the Korean peninsula. It’s not enough to pressure China to impose sanctions on North Korea. They need to understand that this regime poses a threat to stability in the region that undermines their security as well. We need to bring them to the realization that reunification is going to happen one way or the other. We can either do it the sensible way, or it will happen in a much more threatening way. I don’t pretend that’s easy, but that’s the real solution.”

He said if reunification occurs, the “nation-building” necessary to repair communism-ravaged North Korea would be done by the Korean people themselves.

“To return to the German analogy, the country in the North Atlantic region that wanted German reunification most was the United States,” he noted. “The other European powers feared it, the West Germans thought it would cost too much, but ultimately, it was the United States that prevailed. I think the same thing is true here.”

“The South Koreans are worried about their pensions. In fact, the reunification of the two Koreas would produce an economic boom for South Korea,” he argued. “A huge labor force in the North that would become available to their capital investments – boy, I tell you, the Korean peninsula would just take off after reunification.”

“What China needs to be convinced of is that they wouldn’t see American troops on the Yalu River, the border with China, after reunification,” Bolton stressed. “They saw that movie in 1950. They didn’t like [it] then. They don’t like it now. Fortunately, we don’t want to be on the Yalu River either. We want to be at the southern tip of the peninsula so we can deploy elsewhere in East Asia if there’s a crisis. There’s a deal there.”

“As I say, it’s not easy. I don’t underestimate it. But there’s a way to do this if we start now and persist on it,” he said.

“I would be very wary of Chinese assurances that they’re going to help persuade North Korea to give up the nuclear weapons program,” Bolton cautioned. “They’ve said that for 25 years, and they haven’t done a single thing to materially impede North Korea’s nuclear program. I think further discussions with North Korea, further efforts to pressure North Korea, are basically a waste of time. The way to end the North’s nuclear program is to end the North – merge it, reunify it with South Korea.”

John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

At the White House on Thursday, President Donald Trump met with the first responders to the I-85 bridge collapse.

The president asked the group of 14 uniformed fire and police chiefs to introduce themselves to the White House media press pool.

“You know these folks back here, they’re very famous, most of them, it’s called the media,” he said, as the group laughed.

“They’re very honorable people,” Trump added, as the camera shutters clicked. “But you are more honorable, I can tell you that.”

Trump thanked the first responders for their efforts, and vowed to improve the country’s infrastructure.

“Your skill and courage saved many lives, represented true strength and the true strength of America,” he said. “Really great job fellas, great job.”

The reporters at TheBigLead.com gathered together recently to discuss the question of playing golf with President Donald Trump, and most vowed not to ever play with the commander in chief — not that any of them have ever been asked to do so.

In an April 13 feature, TheBigLead asked, “Given how much golf every President plays, it got us thinking: If you won or were invited to play a round of golf with President Donald Trump, would you play?”

Of the eight BigLead sports reporters asked, only three answered with a “yes.”

Those who said yes, Michael Shamburger, Jason Lisk, and, Jason McIntyre, all answered with a quick paragraph. In the case of Shamburger, he gave but a six-word answer in the affirmative.

Ah, but those who said “no” had a whole lot to say to explain their petulance.

Writer Ty Duffy puffed himself up as a moral warrior for refusing to play golf with Trump. In fact, Duffy said he wouldn’t even deign to shake Trump’s hand on or off the fairways.

Next, Kyle Koster was blunt with his answer. “No,” Koster huffed. “I have no interest in spending any time with Donald Trump.”

Writer Ryan Phillips, as apparently someone smarter and more interesting than Trump, said he would not want to golf with POTUS because, “he just seems like someone I’d have absolutely no desire to talk to or be around for hours.”

For his part, Stephen Douglas, who also said “no,” went on to insist, “it’s complicated.” While admitting it would be quite a thing to tell a child that daddy played golf with a president, Douglas also noted that refusing to play with a president is also quite a story. Ultimately, Douglas deemed the opportunity a “hard pass.”

Finally, unlike the others, Ryan Glasspiegel — who also said he wouldn’t play — didn’t eschew the possibility because he hates Trump, but because he hates golf.

Los Angeles-based street artist provocateur Sabo is back again, this time to skewer North Korean leader Kim Jong-un with a series of mock posters promoting a fictional line of “Trump’s North Korean BBQ.”

The mock posters — which have popped up around the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles — feature the North Korean dictator’s head superimposed onto a roasted pig’s body, and with an apple placed in his mouth. Alongside the image is an insert of a smiling Trump.

The taglines for the mock advertisements include “The finest in K-town,” “The world’s greatest really,” and “Cooked up by five star chef James Mattis.”

A telephone number displayed on one of the billboards apparently connects to an art gallery in Beverly Hills.

The posters’ appearance in Los Angeles comes as hostilities between the United States and North Korea have hit renewed heights in recent weeks. NBC News reported that the National Security Council presented military options to President Trump — including the possible assassination of the North Korean dictator — to deal with the country’s increasingly defiant nuclear program ahead of Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week.

Sabo has previously featured images of Trump in his street art. In November, just after Trump’s victory in the presidential election, the street artist peppered Los Angeles-area bus benches with fake advertisements for Sotheby’s real estate sales, in a campaign lampooning numerous celebrities’ pledges to move out of the country if Trump were elected.

Most recently, the artist trolled the Academy Awards by erecting posters outside the Dolby Theater in Hollywood that blasted the film industry’s “unwatchable movies.”

Sabo has also skewered Hillary Clinton, at one time placing an image of the former Democratic presidential candidate inside a washing machine as part of a “money laundering” series, alongside an image of actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

Bernie Marcus, co-founder of Job Creators Network and retired co-founder of The Home Depot, pens an op-ed titled “Trump’s Results” stating that President Donald Trump has set an optimistic tone for the business world.

From RealClearPolitics:

The business community is brimming with optimism across America – the highest level in ten years. I know it, because I hear it from my colleagues every day. We’re hopeful, and for good reason: President Donald Trump is moving his job creation agenda forward resolutely.

…

Maybe because so few politicians have ever signed the front of a paycheck, they don’t see what CEO’s see.

We look past the remarkable 12 percent growth in the stock market, a rising tide lifting pensioners and middle class Americans alike, and see the Consumer Confidence Index, which just hit its highest mark since December of 2000. “Consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions improved considerably,” Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement on Tuesday.

That’s all 100 percent Donald Trump. But there’s far more, if you get past the screaming negative headlines and listen.

Michigan’s capital city rescinded its decision to declare itself a “sanctuary city” after the city council held a vote Wednesday evening regarding Lansing’s sanctuary status.

Lansing City Council voted 5-2 to reverse a decision made April 3 in a 6-0 vote that deemed the city a “sanctuary city” in writing, the Detroit Free Press reported.

A letter the city council received from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging the council to remove all references to “sanctuary city” from its resolution is behind the change in course, the Associated Press reported.

The term “sanctuary city” has sparked much debate as some cities decide to fight President Trump’s decision to crack down on cities that refuse to have their law enforcement agencies cooperate with U.S. immigration authorities.

“The term ‘sanctuary’ in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting — so distracting in my opinion that’s it’s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,” said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke. “It’s basically a ‘don’t ask’ policy, which was outlined by the mayor’s executive order and what we had in our policy complements that.”

The council’s decision does not change the recent executive order penned by Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero, which prohibits Lansing police officers and city employees from asking about immigration statuses “except as required by federal or state statute or court decision,” M Live reported.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b691e8459:114037e:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In remarks given to the media on Thursday, President Donald Trump said he did not know whether or not if the use of the “mother of all bombs” on an ISIS stronghold in Afghanistan would send a message to North Korea.

He added, however, North Korea would be “taken care of” and emphasized his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.President Donald Trump said Thursday that he does not know whether the U.S. military’s use of the so-called “mother of all bombs” in Afghanistan will send a message to North Korea, but he said “the problem” with that country “will be taken care of,” regardless.

“I don’t know if this sends a message,” he replied. “It doesn’t make a difference if it does or not. North Korea is a problem. It’s a problem that will be taken care of. I will say this — I think China has really been working very hard. I have really gotten to like and respect President Xi. He’s a terrific person. We spent a lot of time together in Florida. And he’s a very special man. So we’ll see how it goes. I think he’s going to try very hard.”

The win of Republican Ron Estes in the Kansas special election spoiled the victory celebration that the Democrats and the Main Stream Media had been hoping for. Yet the first rule of celebrations is that there’s always another celebration—and we don’t yet know who will be happy in 2018.

In recent days, in the run-up to the Jayhawk State’s voting, MSM headlines had been lipsmacking in their anticipation of a GOP defeat. Here’s Reuters: “Dem’s surge in Kansas special election has GOP worried.” And Vox: “The GOP won this Kansas district by 31 points. Democrats think they can turn it blue.” And the Los Angeles Times: “Republicans getting antsy over special congressional vote–in ruby-red Kansas, of all places.”

Well, it didn’t happen—Estes, the Republican, won. Indeed, the election wasn’t actually that close; seven points is a perfectly respectable margin. Yes, it’s true that just last November, the former holder of the House seat, Mike Pompeo, now Director of the CIA in the Trump administration, won by 31 points; but special elections are quirky, because turnout is low. In 2016, some 275,000 Kansans voted in the fourth district’s election; on Tuesday, barely more than 100,000 cast ballots.

Of course, the MSM never gives up on its search for bad news about Republicans. The Huffington Post, for instance, put the best face it could on the results: “A Kansas Special Election Just Shook Up Washington/ Republican Ron Estes won a race seen as an opportunity for Democrats to rebuke President Donald Trump.” And The Washington Post injected mucho ominousness: “Republicans won, but the closeness of a Kansas special election could reverberate.” Indeed, the Post sent one of its national reporters all the way to Wichita for the election, and yet since the GOPer won, the story ended up buried inside the hard-copy of the newspaper, as opposed to landing on page one.

Still, there are more special elections to come. As Politico put it, Democrats hope to deliver “stinging defeats” to Trump in future contests, including in Georgia, Montana, and, according to reports, Pennsylvania.

Of these races, the battle for the sixth district of Georgia, in suburban Atlanta, is getting the most attention. In that contest, the anointed Democrat, Jon Ossoff, revealed on April 6 that he had raised $8.3 million, which the Atlanta Journal-Constitution described, correctly, as a “stunning figure.” In the meantime, the 11 Republicans in the race seem to be dividing up a smaller pie.

Moreover, Ossoff’s dollar total, wherever it winds up, will not include expenditures from liberal independent groups. And those independent groups are, indeed, energized. As noted, Virgil doesn’t put much credence in the statistical gyrations of a lone election, but he does worry about larger general trends. And this headline bespeaks a larger trend: “Left rising on Facebook.” In the measured words of Axios’ Sara Fischer, “Facebook is a good tool for observing the rise of political movements.” She continued:

New tools, like call-to-action buttons, fundraising buttons and buttons to contact elected officials, combined with traditional tools, like mass-event invitations, make it easy for political groups to form and spread on Facebook.

In other words, heavy activism on Facebook is heavy activism, period.

So while the Georgia 6 seat has been Republican for four decades—Newt Gingrich held it, then now-Senator Johnny Isakson, and then Tom Price, now Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services—the polling suggests that Ossoff has a real chance of snatching victory. (The election is April 18, with a runoff, if needed, on June 20.)

So what’s going on? It seemed that just yesterday, the Republicans had all the political energy. Where’d it go?

Actually, it wasn’t yesterday, it was last year. In November, the GOP scored a great success, and it wasn’t just Trump; his win, in fact, was toward the low end of presidential victories. It was, in fact, a sweep for the entire Republican Party.

But that was then, when swing voters joined committed activists in joint determination to be rid of Barack Obama and his Democrats.

Since then, however, the energy has shifted. An early indicator came on January 20 and 21, when the number of anti-Trump protestors in Washington, DC, appeared to exceed the number of pro-Trump inaugural celebrants.

Indeed, here we might pause to make a somewhat glum point about the nature of political energy: It almost always goes against the party in the White House. That is, when a party wins the presidency, its grassroots tend to become complacent; after all, their guy won the big one. By contrast, the losing side tends to get angry, and so it starts organizing with a vengeance—or, one might say, with an eye towards vengeance.

We can recall that this was the story—that is, “outs” being more motivated than “ins”—of Republicans during the Obama era. In those eight years, the GOP gained at least 1,030 seats across the country, including, of course, both chambers of Congress.

Yet in fact, the pattern is bipartisan; steep losses for the White House party have been common for more than a century. For the sake of the curious, we can add that sometimes the party controlling 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has, in fact, been able to rejuvenate itself in midstream; one such occasion was the Democratic Party under the leadership of Harry Truman, back in 1948.

So today, Republicans can hope that Trump, too, proves to be a tonic for his party.

Yet at the same time, it pays to be mindful of the conventional wisdom. It’s not always right, but it’s also not always wrong. And a good dose of that wisdom comes from veteran political analyst Nathan Gonzales, writing about the upcoming midterm elections:

The Republican majority in the House was at risk before the results in Kansas. The Republican majority is at risk after the results in Kansas. The president’s party has lost House seats in 18 of the last 20 midterm elections going back to 1938. In those 18 elections, the president’s party has lost an average of 33 seats. Democrats need to gain 24 seats in Nov. 2018 to regain the majority. . . . When the [Kansas] 4th District results are lined up with what’s happening in the special election in Georgia’s 6th District, and Trump’s slumping job rating, Republicans are whistling past the graveyard if they think there isn’t an at least temporary problem that extends beyond Kansas. President Trump is inspiring Democrats to action. [Emphasis added]

To be sure, the past is not necessarily prologue; if it was, a unique figure such as Trump would not now be the 45th president. Moreover, every midterm is different; sometimes losses have been severe, sometimes mild—and yes, rarely, the presidential party has actually gained seats.

Okay, so what can Republicans do to improve their prospects in 2018? Aside from all the usual injunctions about not being complacent, here’s a Virgilian thought: Find a better issue than healthcare. That is, the GOP has more politically appealing issues—much more appealing.

Yes, Republicans have campaigned for years on the repeal of Obamacare, or, as it was usually expressed, “repeal and replace.” And yes, most of the GOP’s activist base, and much of its policy intelligentsia, has been deeply invested in that goal.

Yet at the same time, it’s painfully clear that all that effort didn’t translate into an agreed-upon legislative package that lived up to the promise of repeal and replace.

The failure of the American Health Care Act (AHCA)—pulled from what was destined to be a losing vote on March 24—happened for one basic reason: The bill was unpopular. According to a Quinnipiac poll, just 17 percent of Americans supported the legislation, while 56 percent were opposed.

Not surprisingly, such upside-down numbers have immediate consequences. Rep. Justin Amash, a leading Republican critic of AHCA, said afterward, if the bill had gone to the floor of the House, between 50 and 80 Republicans would have voted against it (plus, of course, every Democrat).

Since then, nothing seems to have changed. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released earlier this month, 64 percent of Americans are happy that AHCA died.

Moreover, the same poll found that 75 percent of Americans, including a majority of Trump supporters, now want the Trump administration to work to make Obamacare succeed. That’s right: Make Obamacare succeed. Virgil can add: This last finding is ominous, 2018-wise. If the Kaiser polling is accurate, then the notion that Republicans could benefit by simply sitting back and watching Obamacare “explode” is risky in the extreme, because the resulting shrapnel would hurt elephants, not donkeys.

In fact, the politics of healthcare seem to be shifting rapidly, in a way that many on the right will find vexing. As we all remember, in the last couple of midterms, Republicans won on an anti-Obamacare message. And yet now, the mood seems to be more anti-anti-Obamacare.

One explanation for this change is that the Republican Party is changing. As we know, the rich are increasingly voting Democratic. To be sure, today’s Democrats are a lot different from the Democrats of, say, Harry Truman’s era. The hottest causes for today’s left seem to be gay, gender, and green.

As a result, the Republicans are now getting the support of those who find themselves priced out of snazzy fundraisers in Scarsdale or Santa Monica. In fact, the states where Truman ran strong seven decades ago are now mostly Republican, while the anti-Truman states of yore are now mostly Democratic.

These political changes, of course, will inevitably translate into policy changes. And among those changes is a significant shift in GOP attitudes on healthcare.

For instance, according to the Pew Research Center, moderate- and low-income Republicans have grown increasingly sympathetic to some sort of national health insurance. Specifically, in 2016, Pew asked if it was the “responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage.” And for 34 percent of Republicans making $30,000 to $75,000 a year, the answer was “yes.” Furthermore, among Republicans making less than $30,000, 52 percent said “yes.”

To be sure, the majority of Republicans still reject such a government mission, even if, as the polling shows, their relative strength in the GOP is shrinking.

And here we might pause to note an often-overlooked fact about American healthcare: Since 1986, it’s been federal law that hospital emergency rooms must accept patients, regardless of ability to pay; that was a bill signed by President Ronald Reagan. In other words, even before the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in 2010, a rudimentary form of national health insurance was already in place.

To further illustrate where things seem to be headed, we can take another look at the state where we started: Kansas.

The Koch Brothers notwithstanding, Kansas is not a rich state; its median income is below the national average. And earlier this month, the Republican-controlled Kansas House of Representatives voted nearly 2:1 to expand its Medicaid program, in order to benefit from the favorable financing offered under Obamacare.

That expansion effort failed, thanks to a veto by Governor Sam Brownback (R). Yet it’s worth noting that the vote to override Brownback’s veto was 81:44, which means that half of the Republicans in the body voted in favor of expanding the health program. And earlier, the Kansas State Senate, which is more than 3:1 Republican, had voted lopsidedly, too, for Medicaid expansion. (As an aside, Brownback’s approval rating is in the mid-20s; according to one survey, among all the nation’s governors, Brownback is held in the lowest esteem.)

In response to this Topeka drama, some will say that Kansas Republicans include a bunch of RINOs. Yes, that’s one way of looking at it. Another way, of course, is that the GOP is changing.

That message should have come across loud and clear in the 2016 elections. Yet evidently, for the sake of Republican fortunes in the 2018 midterms, it’s a message worth repeating.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b691e8459:114037c:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Hollywood Reporter has just published its “35 Most Powerful People in New York Media” list, and this year’s roundup includes some of entertainment’s most anti-Donald Trump television personalities.

Among the 35 New York media power players named are Alec Baldwin, who has spent months lampooning President Trump on Saturday Night Live, TBS’ Full Frontal host Samantha Bee, and CBS’s The Late Show host Stephen Colbert.

Baldwin, who hinted last month that he is prepared to retire his parody version of Trump, tells THR that his dream interview would be with former President Barack Obama and that Hillary Clinton’s next gig should be secretary-general of the United Nations, “after Trump is gone.”

Bee, whose weekly late-night show rarely airs without dedicating at least one segment to scandalizing a Trump-related topic, said after Trump’s election that white people “ruined America.” The 43-year-old comedienne is set to host an alternative White House Correspondents’ Dinner, which will air on TBS opposite the real, D.C.-based WHCA dinner that the president plans to skip.

Meanwhile, Colbert’s Late Show ratings resurgence has made the former Comedy Central star the king of late night, edging out his nighttime NBC rival and longtime ratings juggernaut Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show.

The CBS funnyman’s ten-week ratings victory over Fallon coincided with a ramp-up of searing anti-Trump comedy sketches that Colbert’s audience — and certainly CBS chief Les Moonves — enjoy.

Other New York media elites making THR’s top 35 list include CNN host Anderson Cooper, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, NBC late-night host Seth Meyers, New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, New York Post CEO and publisher Jesse Angelo, ABC News president James Goldston, Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith and new NBC News anchor Megyn Kelly.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with some of the country’s top law enforcement officials just hours after his major border policy roll-out Tuesday.

Sessions gave the keynote address to the mid-year meeting of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Litchfield Park, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix. The speech followed his first tour of the U.S.-Mexico border as Attorney General of the United States. He appraised the attendees, including the heads of dozens of state and local law enforcement agencies, of the Trump administration’s vision for crime reduction. “Leadership from the top is essential,” he said in his remarks as prepared, “and President Trump has given us clear direction.”

Border security once again took center stage. Sessions built on the remarks he made earlier as he unveiled the new polices and guidance. He added a dig at so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions”:

The Department of Justice is working with cities and states that are serious about enforcing the law and making their neighborhoods safer. I thank and applaud those jurisdictions. Please know that you have the full support of our Department — and that we are ready to provide more resources to help you keep your communities safe. But there are holdouts. Some mayors and city councils, and even a police chief and a sheriff here and there, are refusing to work with the federal government, choosing instead to protect the criminal aliens who harm public safety. Today, I urge them to work with us.

Opposition to “sanctuary city” resistance to federal immigration enforcement has been a centerpiece of Sessions’s tenure at the Department of Justice. He has been exploring methods, including revoking Justice Department grants, for compelling these jurisdictions to cooperate.

In addition to immigration, Sessions addressed the wider issue of violent crime in America. Citing FBI statistics, Sessions raised concerns about the apparent end of the three-decade long decline in violent crime and the significant uptick over the last two years. “My fear is that this surge in violent crime is not a ‘blip,’ but the start of a dangerous new trend — one that puts at risk the hard-won gains that have made our country a safer place,” he said.

The Attorney General then touted President Donald Trump’s executive orders on crime and the creation of a task force to integrate feedback from local law enforcement. With these measures, Sessions was confident violent crime could be brought back under control. “Not many people are capable of murder and other violent crimes. The more of them we take off the streets so they can no longer harm others, the safer our neighborhoods will be,” he said.

Sessions closed his address with a message that his justice department would stand behind law enforcement officers:

Unfortunately, in recent years, as you know, law enforcement as a whole has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the crimes and unacceptable deeds of a few bad actors. Amid this intense criticism, morale has gone down, while the number of officers killed in the line of duty has gone up.

Sessions specifically called out the consent decrees with which some police departments accused of engaging in misconduct have been hit. His Justice Department has sought to walk back some of the decrees agreed to in the waning days of the Obama administration. “These decrees are not a silver bullet for solving the tough issues confronting some police departments,” Sessions said, raising concerns over the diversion of police resources to “highly-paid monitors.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6895ad19:f65286:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The U.S. military on Thursday dropped a massive 21,600-pound bomb in Afghanistan targeting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria fighters in a series of cave complexes.

At 7:32 p.m., a U.S. MC-130 aircraft dropped the bomb – the U.S.’s largest non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat – in Achin district in the eastern province of Nangarhar, Afghanistan.

It was the first time the bomb, known as the GBU-43, or “Massive Ordnance Air Blast,” was used in combat. It has a yield of 11 tons of TNT, and is nicknamed the “Mother of All Bombs.”

The bomb targeted ISIS’s Afghan affiliate, ISIS-Khorasan, “as part of ongoing efforts” to defeat the group in 2017, according to a statement from U.S. Forces – Afghanistan.

“The strike was designed to minimize the risk to Afghan and U.S. Forces conducting clearing operations in the area while maximizing the destruction of ISIS-K fighters and facilities,” the statement said.

The U.S. “took every precaution to avoid civilian casualties with this strike,” the statement also said.

The U.S. commander of forces in Afghanistan said the massive bomb was used since ISIS-K has thickened their defense.

“As ISIS-K’s losses have mounted, they are using [improvised explosive devices], bunkers and tunnels to thicken their defense,” said Army Gen. John W. Nicholson. “This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K.”

It is not clear whether it was planned under the Obama administration or the Trump administration.

Pentagon spokesman Adam Stump said the plan to drop the bomb has been in the works for a “few months,” and that the bomb had been in the country for “some time.”

President Donald Trump did not say whether he authorized the bombing, but said he has authorized the military, implying that senior military leaders had the authority to use the bomb:

Everybody knows exactly what happened. What I do is I authorize my military. We havethe greatest military in the world and they’ve done a job as usual. We have given them total authorization and that’s what they’re doing and frankly that’s why they’ve been so successful lately. “If you look at what’s happened over the last eight weeks and compare that really to what’s happened over the past eight years, you’ll see there’s a tremendous difference, tremendous difference. So we have incredible leaders in the military, and we have incredible military. We are very proud of them. This was another very, very successful mission.

As for whether the dropping of the MOAB was meant to send a message to North Korea, Trump replied:

I don’t know if this sends a message, it doesn’t make any difference if it does or not. North Korea is a problem, the problem will be taken care of.

The MOAB is GPS-guided with precision guidance. It was designed to put pressure on then-Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s military, according to an Air Force article.

“The goal is to have the pressure be so great that Saddam Hussein cooperates,” then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in a March 2003 interview, according to the article. “Short of that – an unwillingness to cooperate – the goal is to have the capabilities of the coalition so clear and so obvious that there is an enormous disincentive for the Iraqi military to fight against the coalition.”

The MOAB’s final test was on March 11, 2003. It was first delivered into theater on April 1, 2003.

CNN has said the similarity between the French presidential election and the U.S. presidential election is “frightening” as they predict Marine Le Pen’s polling numbers could be much higher than current polls indicate.

The U.S. presidential election in 2016 saw more than its fair share of twists and turns, ultimately leading to an electoral college victory for President Donald Trump. CNN claims the French election is looking similar in many ways as establishment candidates like Republican François Fillon and Socialist party Benoit Hamon are pushed out of the race.

The piece, which was written by David A. Andelman, claims that French media is behaving much like U.S. media did in the run-up to the election, “effectively baptising one of the two leading candidates the winner even before the first ballot is cast”.

French newspaper Le Monde asked readers: “What would the first months of an Emmanuel Macron presidency look like?” which Andelman said evoked U.S. media who claimed that Hillary Clinton could not lose. Some outlets like the Huffington Post gave her a 98.2 per cent chance to win on election day.

Andelman claims the two front runners, Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, are both “alarming”. Le Pen because she wants to remove France from the European Union and the euro, as well as tackle Islamisation, and Macron because “he has no party machine behind him to back him in any tough battle in the National Assembly”.

Most polls indicate a tie between Macron and Le Pen in the first round. But CNN says the polls are faulty and predicts Le Pen will likely have a much larger turnout, claiming many of Le Pen’s supporters do not talk to media and do not spend time online where most of the French polling is conducted.

France, Ifop poll: Le Pen (FN-ENF): 25%

Macron (EM-*): 24% ↓

Fillon (LR-EPP): 19% ↑

Melénchon (FI-LEFT): 17% ↑… https://t.co/f9TkOEYIuk — Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) April 7, 2017

Scandals have also been a major factor for candidates like Fillon who has been mired in accusations of financial corruption. Le Pen, Andelman claims, “seems largely immune to every scandal”, and compared her to President Trump saying she is “rather like someone else who was declared out of the race more than once”.

Finally, Andelman touched on the narrative of “fake news” and Russian involvement which many in the U.S. media said had a hand in the loss of Hillary Clinton. Citing the recent meeting between Le Pen and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, he said Le Pen was the “favoured candidate” of the Kremlin and “Russian hackers” were spreading “fake news” to help her.

The first round of the French presidential election will take place on 23 April, followed by a second round between the first and second place candidates on 7 May.

Wednesday on WBAP NewsTalk 820AM’s “The Chris Salcedo Show,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said of the close results in the Kansas special House election this week, “I think the election was certainly a warning sign.”

Discussing Tuesday’s 20-point shift in the special election to fill CIA Director Mike Pompeo’s seat from President Donald Trump’s victory in November, which he won the district by 27 points, to Republican Ron Estes only beating Democrat Jim Thompson by 7 points, Cruz said,”The radical left is filled with fury right now. I mean, they’re blind with rage. As a result, they’re energized—they will crawl over broken glass. And we knew they would show up, and they did show up.”

Cruz said, “If we want to win elections, whether these special elections for congressional seats or the elections coming up in November 2018, the way to do it is to deliver on our promises. That is what I am urging every day President Trump and leaders in both houses we have got to do what we said we would do.”

Cruz said Republicans have to follow through with the repeal of Obamacare, major tax reform and funding the border wall.

He added, “My message to my colleagues is simple. Let’s do what we said we would do. Let’s behave in April the same way we said we would behave in November. That disconnect is why people are so furious with Washington, so frustrated with Washington because we keep electing people who say one thing on the campaign trial and then behave differently in Washington.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b687b46cc:1035155:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The British government is discriminating against Christian refugees from the Middle East, a former Archbishop of Canterbury has said.

Lord Carey of Clifton accused “politically correct” officials of being “institutionally biased” against Christians.

The former archbishop, who was the most senior cleric in the Church of England from 1991 to 2002, added that less than two per cent of Syrian asylum seekers offered asylum in the UK were Christian, despite Christians making up 10 per cent of the country’s pre-war population.

“In the run-up to Easter British taxpayers will be appalled by this institutional bias against Christians by politically correct officials,” Lord Carey said.

“In this the British government is not just breaking its manifesto pledge to look after Christian refugees, it also appears to be breaking the law.”

He cited legal advice from barrister Paul Diamond who said the programme may constitute “indirect discrimination” under British and European Union law.

He also said Christians find it more difficult to access camps run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees because they are often run by officials “hostile to minorities”.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Carey said: “These camps are invariably run by Muslim officials who are often hostile to minorities – especially Muslims who have converted to Christianity.

“So the refugees who are too scared to enter the camps lose out on both food aid and opportunities to find sanctuary in safer countries.”

The government’s response, he added, has been far too weak.

“In my experience government ministers understand the problem. Yet their well-meaning efforts to correct the imbalance are being blocked by often well-meaning but hopelessly politically-correct officials in Whitehall.

“They claim that to support Christians is to discriminate against others, but Christians are disproportionately persecuted and they are discriminated against by the very policies which aim to secure equal treatment.”

Last month, Lord Carey also hit the headlines after comparing U.S. President Donald Trump to the Good Samaritan for “giving a voice to the silent”.

“Many will recoil at the identification of Donald Trump as the Good Samaritan but why not, why not?” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b687b46cc:1035151:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump defended his political agenda after media reports highlighted a pivot to a more centrist agenda.

“Economic confidence is soaring as we unleash the power of private sector job creation and stand up for the American Workers,” Trump wrote on Twitter with the hashtag #AmericaFirst.

Some of Trump’s core supporters were surprised by his decision to launch missiles in Syria while reversing his committment to naming China as a currency manipulator. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump signaled his willingness to work with China in order to get assistance with the threat posed by North Korea.

“I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea,” Trump wrote Thursday morning. “If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will!”

Trump has taken a new interest in global affairs, promising to fix the mess left behind by former President Barack Obama’s efforts to restore American diplomacy.

“Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia,” he said. “At the right time everyone will come to their senses &amp; there will be lasting peace!”

While Trump has had success on an executive level promoting his agenda, big issues requiring him to work with Congress remain. His effort to replace Obamacare remains unaccomplished, which is further stalling plans for major tax reform and infrastructure spending. Republicans in Congress have also signaled that they will not pursue funding for Trump’s wall on the southern border right away, leading to some discouragement from his base.

But Trump remained positive about the progress made since he was inaugurated.

“One by one we are keeping our promises – on the border, on energy, on jobs, on regulations,” Trump wrote. “Big changes are happening! Jobs are returning, illegal immigration is plummeting, law, order and justice are being restored. We are truly making America great again!”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b687b46cc:103514f:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump signed a resolution Thursday that overturns former President Barack Obama’s rule that forced states to provide family planning grants under Title X to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers.

In a signing ceremony that was closed to the press, Trump signed H.J. Res. 43, which allows states to withhold federal funds from facilities that provide abortions. In attendance were Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator Seema Verma, Susan B. Anthony president Marjorie Dannenfelser, and Penny Nance, CEO of Concerned Women for America.

“Prioritizing funding away from Planned Parenthood to comprehensive healthcare alternatives is a winning issue,” said Dannenfelser, reports the Washington Examiner. “We expect to see Congress continue its efforts to redirect additional taxpayer funding away from Planned Parenthood through pro-life healthcare reform after the spring break recess.”

“I think the president’s signature today is an important step and it shows that the president is keeping his campaign promises,” Verma said. “This shows that we want states to be in charge of their own decision making.”

Planned Parenthood tweeted its disapproval of the measure:

BREAKING: Trump signs bill undoing protections for 4 million people getting care through #TitleX. #HandsOffMyBC https://t.co/MUIHyLSBYe pic.twitter.com/XfTlOJTxJa — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) April 13, 2017

The House approved H.J. Res. 43, introduced by Rep. Diane Black (R-TN), in February. The resolution used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to rescind the Obama administration rule, enacted during the last days of the former president’s term.

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) sponsored the measure in the Senate. Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote at the end of March to enable approval in that chamber after Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against it.

In a floor speech in the House, Black said the purpose of the resolution is to “affirm the right of states to fund the healthcare providers that best suit their needs, without fear of reprisal from their own federal government.”

Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the U.S., performing at least 300,000 abortions every year.

About a dozen states have attempted to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s funding in the wake of the release of videos that alleged the group harvests the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and sells them for profit. These states have attempted to redirect the funding to other community healthcare centers, which provide more expansive services than Planned Parenthood and outnumber the abortion chain by at least 20 to 1.

Despite the overwhelming number of community healthcare centers, however, the Obama administration, an avid supporter of Planned Parenthood, said that by redirecting funding away from the group, the states “have interfered with” low-income individuals’ ability to access federal assistance quickly.

The Heritage Foundation’s Melanie Israel wrote at The Daily Signal the resolution was necessary “to both protect life and reassert that the states have Tenth Amendment rights to allocate Title X family planning grants in such a manner that prioritizes community health clinics and true family planning over the industrial abortion industry as represented by Planned Parenthood.”

“The HHS rule is a classic example of excessive federal rulemaking and executive overreach for partisan political gain, making it a perfect target for nullification under the CRA,” she added.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6861445e:100393b:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A leftist environmentalist nonprofit and a Democrat Arizona congressman filed a lawsuit that could halt or slow construction of President Trump’s promised border wall. The group wants an impact to determine any harm caused to jaguars and Mexican gray wolves by a barrier and additional border agents.

In February, U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly ordered the hiring of 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and 500 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) officers, reported Breitbart Texas. DHS also discontinued the Obama Administration’s “catch and release” program known as the “Priority Enforcement Program” (PEP).

The Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity, whose website includes a banner “#EARTH2TRUMP: RESIST,” “Saving Polar Bears,” and “Endangered Species Condoms,” filed the lawsuit on Wednesday asking for a review of the social, economic, and environmental impacts of a border wall.

“Trump’s border wall will divide and destroy the incredible communities and wild landscapes along the border,” claims the Center’s executive director, Kieran Suckling.

The nonprofit’s ED added, “Endangered species like jaguars and ocelots don’t observe international boundaries and should not be sacrificed for unnecessary border militarization. Their survival and recovery depends on being able to move long distances across the landscape and repopulate places on both sides of the border where they’ve lived for thousands of years.”

U.S. Rep. Paul Grijalva (D-AZ) is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. He released a statement after it was filed saying:

American environmental laws are some of the oldest and strongest in the world, and they should apply to the borderlands just as they do everywhere else. These laws exist to protect the health and well-being of our people, our wildlife, and the places they live.

Grijalva, who says his district includes 300 miles of the U.S./Mexico Border added, “Trump’s wall – and his fanatical approach to our southern border – will do little more than perpetuate human suffering while irrevocably damaging our public lands and the wildlife that depend on them.”

The environmental group and the Arizona Democrat are seeking a judicial mandate to require the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to prepare a “programmatic environmental impact statement.”

The congressman says that road construction, off-road vehicle patrols, lighting, base camps and checkpoints on the border would “significantly impact the borderlands environment.”

The plaintiffs also charge that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (now DHS) has not updated the programmatic environmental impact statement for the U.S./Mexico Border enforcement program since 2001.

The statement released by Rep. Grijalva concludes, “Meanwhile, the number of undocumented migrants moving through the southwestern borderlands is at a historic low, and the border is more secure than it’s ever been.”

The plaintiffs filed the legal action in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona.

Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of the best-selling book Clinton Cash, appeared on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily to give a status report on President Trump’s efforts to “drain the swamp” of Washington corruption.

Unfortunately, Schweizer saw little sign of progress.

“I’m basically using two yardsticks. One is pushing for institutional reform, meaning that you’re pushing executive orders or laws that lead to some structural changes to get rid of cronyism and corruption,” he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. “That would be one measure. It’s pretty early for any president to measure them by that yardstick, so I think that one you can kind of give him a pass at this point. Let’s talk again in a few months and see if there’s any progress.”

“The second yardstick is personnel,” he continued. “What sort of people are you bringing in, and what kind of agendas do they have? There I think, in a way, we’ve kind of had a setback.”

“This is a place where you can bring in outsiders who are interested in pushing agendas that represent the broad interests of the American people, rather than special narrow interests. Here, if you look, it’s been somewhat disappointing. I think if people had said six, eight months ago that a Donald Trump presidency would be populated by as many people from, say, Goldman Sachs as it is today, people would be quite shocked because his rhetoric and certainly his platform was not conducive to bringing on managing partners from Goldman Sachs to run some very important positions in the White House,” Schweizer said.

“I want to talk about some of the key players – less so Trump’s family members, who we kind of had a sense of who they are and where they came from, but you are seeing this wing, this Democrat wing inside the White House, comprised of Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Gary Cohn. Also, Gary Cohn’s right-hand lady appears to be a lady named Dina Powell, who’s titularly, I guess, a Republican, or at least technically a Republican, but apparently is very moderate. What do you make of Gary Cohn? Who is he, and is he someone that this audience should be concerned about?” Marlow asked.

Schweizer replied that he was concerned about Cohn’s “institutional connections” and past work for Goldman Sachs.

“Goldman Sachs has a long history of serving the interests of Goldman Sachs, as you would expect with any institution,” he said. “The problem is that Goldman Sachs really has been around some of the largest financial risks, which have led to bailouts. Going back to 1993, you had the Mexican peso bailout, where Bill Clinton basically bailed out Goldman because they bought a lot of Mexican bonds. In 1998, you had a similar situation with the East Asian financial crisis. 2008, financial crisis again.”

“So you have this situation where investment bankers or people from Wall Street – like people from Goldman Sachs, like Gary Cohn – come in, and instead of pushing ideas and reforms and policies that support a free market, meaning, in other words, ‘Our goal here is to make sure that banks and financial institutions have a level playing field and they compete because that’s good for everybody,’ instead of doing that, you get people in there who are from Goldman, who want the federal government basically to bail out and to support large financial institutions like Goldman,” he lamented.

“There’s no evidence that Gary Cohn, or some of the other people you’ve got at Treasury and elsewhere, are interested in any kind of reform that holds large financial institutions on Wall Street accountable for their actions,” said Schweizer. “That phrase you remember from just a few years ago, ‘too big to fail,’ which has been ridiculed by so many people, which was the policy of the Obama administration – there’s no indication or evidence by the appointments, by the people now serving the Trump administration, that that is going to change one iota.”

“And that’s a surprise, I think, for a lot of people because the rhetoric and the language was very much geared towards the interests of Wall Street have been benefited at the expense of the interests of Main Street. Thus far, based on the people that are running these large financial institutions in the American government, that does not appear like it’s going to change at all,” he concluded.

Citing recent stories about Trump backing down from labeling China a “currency manipulator,” reversing himself on eliminating the Export-Import Bank, and saying Janet Yellen may remain in charge of the Federal Reserve, Marlow asked, “What the heck is happening, Peter?”

“Those are all major reversals,” Schweizer agreed. “Janet Yellen, for example – very much a strong supporter of the loose money policy. Why does that matter? Well, when you have an extremely low-interest rate, interest rates close to zero, the chief beneficiaries of that are the large financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, because now they can borrow money cheap for some of their leveraged investments, their leveraged bets.”

“Who does it hurt?” he asked. “It tends to hurt a lot of people that are middle class, who are older, who are retired. Why? Well, you can put your money into the bank, and you’re going to get really zero interest for that, for your retirement savings. What you are essentially forced to do in a way, to seek higher yields, is to invest in the stock market rather than in a savings account. The big losers there are the middle class.”

“You look at some of the other policies, the Export-Import Bank – lots of studies and research done here indicate the Export-Import Bank basically benefits a couple of American companies, chief among them, Boeing, the airplane manufacturer. It’s a prime sort of example of crony capitalism,” he said.

“And then when it comes to the currency manipulation issue, wherever one stands on free trade and these sorts of issues, there is no question in my mind that stepping back from accusing the Chinese of currency manipulation benefits large financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, like JP Morgan, because where is their big growing market? Where are they pouring a lot of money? Into China,” Schweizer observed.

“When you have sort of a currency crisis between the United States and China, that’s not a good thing for those institutions. All of these reversals you can look at directly, I would argue, as who is whispering in the president’s ear, who is advising on these issues? And it is people that have these ties to these large financial institutions,” he said.

Marlow turned to strained diplomatic ties with Russia, pronounced the worst relations in decades by both Washington and Moscow. He asked if the Trump administration might be pushing exceptionally hard against Russia due to sensitivity over the media narrative about Russian interference to benefit Trump in the 2016 election.

“People always try to read the tea leaves and see what the Kremlin is doing and why they’re doing it,” Schweizer noted. “The bottom line, what we have to keep in the back of our minds, is that the Russians always view themselves as rivals of the United States. They view us as the sort of hegemonic power that needs to be contested.”

“We also need to keep in mind that for Russia, really since the end of the Cold War, the posture they have adopted has always been one of essentially causing trouble,” he added. “Instability and confusion in the West is seen as a good thing, as far as Russia is concerned. That’s the view that I come from when it comes to the financial ties that the Russian government secured with the Clintons and their friends. That is certainly consistent with it. I think there’s no doubt that they meddled in the election. That’s something they are wont to do, and it needs to be taken seriously.”

“But I think any doubts that have been out there that Donald Trump was sort of the ‘Manchurian candidate’ for Russia, I think, has now been dispelled,” he contended. “Relations certainly aren’t at their lowest point in history – you could look at the Cuban missile crisis. You can look at the 1980s under Reagan where tensions were very, very high, and find other examples.”

“I think it’s very clear by what the secretary of state has said, and what American policy has been, is that the United States is going to protect its interests, and when we see Russia as doing bad things on the global stage, we’re going to act. I personally think that’s a healthy place for us to be,” Schweizer said.

Marlow turned back to Washington corruption and asked Schweizer for suggestions on what steps Trump could take to “drain the swamp.”

“We got off to a quick start, and the quick start was the president asking people that joined the administration to make a pledge that they would not lobby if they served in the Trump administration,” Schweizer responded. “The problem is, initiatives like that have no teeth. In other words, you’re basically asking someone who’s been in politics for a long time to sign a document and give us their word that they’re not going to lobby for five years after they’ve served. We have to take their word for it. It’s not something that can be enforced.”

“What we need is an ethics code that is tight, that is deep, and that can be reinforced,” he suggested. “Now, I recognize that means you’re going to need to pass a law, and you’re going to need to have Congress go along with you, but here’s the thing: this president, I think, came in with a mandate for draining the swamp. I would contest to people that really, the chief reason that he won, that he was elected, was because of revulsion towards the political class. I think even more than building the wall, more than the deregulation agenda, the thing that animated the most voters was the desire to drain the swamp.”

“We need to pass laws on lobbying reform, issues related to crony capitalism,” he urged. “We need to eliminate some government programs like the Export-Import Bank. We need to break up the ecosystem of Washington, DC, that is driving so many of these problems. People wonder, ‘Why does government keep getting bigger and more complex?’ Part of the reason is because there’s a business model connected with that. You need to have a very strong reform agenda.”

“This administration decided to start – their big legislative initiative was repealing Obamacare. I get why they did that, but I think it was a mistake. I think you need to begin with major institutional reform, and then that’s going to inform the policies that you get later on,” Schweizer said.

President Donald Trump fully supports Attorney General Jeff Session’s determination to enforce the nation’s immigration laws, Sessions told radio host Laura Ingraham April 13.

“He’s supported me and [the Department of] Homeland Security in stepping up in enforcement at the border 100 percent,” Sessions said. The inflow of illegals in March was “the lowest monthly total in 17 years … We’re carrying out his agenda.”

Amid evidence of White House infighting, White House officials “have been supportive of what we’re doing. I’ve not felt any pushback against me on anything I’ve done or advocated,” Sessions said.

The president shares the view. He’s still insisting we’re going to build this wall, and he’s not backing down from it. He’s supported me and [the Department of] Homeland Security in stepping up in enforcement at the border 100 percent … We’re carrying out his agenda.

The border wall is going up, said Sessions. Although some sections of the border are too rough to build a wall, the government will build “a substantial barrier through large portions… [because] you need to do that,” he said.

The wall will be backed up by border officers and justice department judges, he said. “We’ll have 50 new judges on the border in the next few weeks, and we’ll add 75 more next year.”

“I am really impressed with [DHS] Secretary [John] Kelly,” he said. His agency has “aggressively pursued the president’s agenda,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b67ebe412:e3cfe0:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Host Mark Levin welcomed Dr. Sebastian Gorka, former Breitbart News national security editor and current deputy assistant to President Trump, to his radio show on Tuesday evening.

Gorka said that current American policy in trouble spots such as Syria and North Korea was consistent with President Trump’s positions during the 2016 campaign.

“Very simply put, the man that was Donald Trump before January the 20th is the same man who is the president today,” he said. “He has re-instigated American leadership around the world. We’re not going to perpetuate the vacuum created by President Obama that was exploited by people like Assad, like Putin, like the crazy regime in North Korea.”

“We are reasserting the values that made America great and will make America great again,” he said, alluding to Trump’s campaign slogan. “It’s leadership from the front, and it’s standing up to the founding principles of the Republic. It’s that simple, Mark.”

“For all the people who supported Donald Trump on November the 8th, I’d like them to think about one thing: what we did on Thursday is not 2003 nor is it the first Gulf War in 1991,” Gorka said.

He suggested:

The president is clear. He’s not about invading other people’s countries and occupying them, but he is not going to let dictators use weapons of mass destruction against unarmed women and children. If you have a problem with us launching a cruise missile strike on an airfield used to execute such an attack, you need to look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, what is the problem with taking that action and making a red line a real red line?

Levin said some disappointed Trump supporters feel he has “embraced the McCain wing of the Republican Party” with his Syrian intervention.

“I say they really need to look at the facts,” Gorka countered. “The idea that deploying 150,000 troops into the Middle East is the same as one of our ships sitting in safety, in the middle of the Med, launching unmanned vehicles to take out this airfield — the two can not be compared.”

“Also, there’s a very important point here: statecraft, leadership is nothing if it doesn’t understand that diplomacy must be backed up by force,” he continued. “We had eight years of just words — words that were exploited by our enemies and, on top of that, the support of our enemies when you look at the JCPOA, the Iran deal, the ransoms and everything else.” He said:

We understand, and the president understands this implicitly, diplomacy is nothing if you’re not prepared to back it up with force. Everyone who needs to understand what we did in Syria on Thursday understands it. Look at the nations that have an issue with it and you will see just how morally sound our actions were — and also how they overlapped with our national security as well.

Gorka noted that Russia’s response to the strike on the Sharyat airbase in Syria has been thus far limited to “some very predictable statements that they have to make for domestic, internal purposes, but I think they are drawing the necessary conclusions.”

“There is a point at which your satrapy, your client state maintaining a state like Assad’s state is no longer in the interest of even the Kremlin,” he said, making one of those necessary conclusions explicit. “I think they’re starting to understand that as well.”

Levin proposed that Russia’s weak economy would hinder them in a conflict with the United States.

“This is one of the things that Ronald Reagan understood,” Gorka agreed:

In one of his first meetings in the NSC, he asked, “What is the GDP of the Soviet Union?” He was told it was roughly on par with California. Then he understood how much of a paper tiger the Soviet Union was. So yes, if you look at the GDP, if you look at their resource-intensive economy, if you look at their demographics — 600,000 people die a year in Russia, more than are born. That’s a demographic reality. So yes, we look at the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be, which was the last White House.

Levin asked for an update on North Korea, which Gorka said he could deliver only with caution because, “unlike the Clinton administration and unlike the Obama administration, we do not give our game plan away — we do not tell our adversaries what to expect from us, as Clinton did in the Balkans, and as the last president did in Iraq.”

“I think people understand, and that the movement of our vessels, the action we took on Thursday, they’re all part of the same kind of deck of cards,” Gorka said. “We are reinforcing the statements made by the president, by Secretary Tillerson, with actions that fill the vacuum created by the Obama administration.”

Levin observed that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is “a very dangerous man.”

“The problem with that nation, in particular, is that unlike other countries, including I would say even the Russian Federation, you simply cannot model them on the rational-actor models that we use,” Gorka said. “When ideology overtakes reasoned cost/benefit analysis, nations like North Korea are very difficult to model. That’s why other messages are needed.”

“That’s the similarity between Iran and North Korea. We are not looking at your standard, rational actors in either case,” he said.

“It’s very important that everybody, whether you voted for him or not, is clear on this issue that there is no desire, and no intent, inside the White House, inside the Oval Office — the president does not wish to be some kind of global policeman,” Gorka stressed. “That is not what we’re talking about.”

However, he agreed with Levin’s point that “we have inherited a global firestorm” from the Obama administration.

“If you look at any cardinal point on the compass — north, south, east or west — the world is on fire,” he said. “Just one thing: if you listen to the United Nations, we have 65 million refugees in the world today. That’s more than we had in 1945, after the death camps and the destruction of World War II.”

“That is, in part, a direct function of the feckless foreign policy and a lack of leadership under the Obama administration,” Gorka contended. “We can’t ignore that because sooner or later that will have a national security impact on every American living in the United States as well.”

Levin feared that even Trump’s request for increased military funding was not enough and that Congress was not moving quickly enough to provide the funds requested.

Gorka said that “certain individuals” in Congress saw the urgency of rebuilding the military, although it was not a “groundswell” yet.

“There’s a lot of freshmen congressmen, many of them, who are actually Iraq veterans. Some of them are my friends,” he said:

They fully understand it. When you look at the U.S. Marine Corps, in the last eight years, ended up having to cannibalize active aircraft they were using so they could use those spare parts for other aircraft. That is the dire situation that we inherited. The president is serious about fixing that as well. But it’s separation of powers, so as you rightly note, we have to have that requisite support on the Hill to make things happen. The purse strings are there. The intent exists in the White House. We’ve already set with the increase in the budget the direction we need to go in, but it’s not just up to the president.

Levin concluded the interview by asking Gorka what it was like to “be under constant attack, in ways that really are quite vicious,” and if he was still glad to be at the White House after dealing with such abuse.

“Look, Mark, I’m living the dream,” Gorka replied. “I was an immigrant. I chose this country because I truly believe it’s the last great hope. I came here nine years ago, and I’m walking around the West Wing every day. God has smiled on me, and I’m thankful for that.”

“With all of these fake news attacks — there’s going to be another one in USA Today tomorrow — I just smile and I laugh. Why? Because I’m not in the cellar of the secret police headquarters in Budapest being tortured, like my father in 1950. So bring it on. Colin Kahl, Ben Rhodes, Politico — I laugh in your face because it is pathetic and it’s only words,” he declared.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b67cb8504:efa3fa:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The stars and producers of ABC’s political drama Scandal are celebrating the show’s centenary episode and sharing their thoughts about how Donald Trump’s election caused anxiety both on and off the screen.

The series’ creator and executive producer Shonda Rhimes revealed in a lengthy interview with the Hollywood Reporter, that Scandal writers were anticipating Hillary Clinton winning the White House last November.

“There was a very specific planned progression that was going to be easy to tell because Hillary was going to be president, and we were going to be living in the light,” Rhimes said. “But it didn’t occur. I’m still trying to come to terms with that.”

Rhimes — who produced a 12-minute biopic of Clinton’s life, that aired live the Democratic National Convention — laments that life under President Trump is more “outrageous” and “horrifying” than anything she could have created for her primetime political TV show.

“One bad thing after another keeps happening, and the world feels very unstable,” said Rhimes said. “So in a world in which all of the things that we would write on ‘Scandal’ are happening in real life, it’s very hard to write ‘Scandal’ the way we used to, when it was like, ‘Let’s make Washington the most outrageous, horrifying place it could ever be.&apos;”

“Any of the stories we planned now just feel like we’re copying what’s happening in reality, which is insane,” said Rhimes.

Scandal’s star Kerry Washington, who plays D.C.’s powerful political fixer Olivia Pope, said “Now, we have a hard time competing with reality.”

Washington’s character underwent an abortion in a fifth-season episode while the Christmas hymn “Silent Night” play along. On that controversial scene, Rhimes said her most pressing concern was clearing the version of the song that included vocals from legendary soul and gospel singer Aretha Franklin.

“I kept going back to our music supervisor, ‘We sure Aretha Franklin is OK with this?&apos;” Rhimes told THR. “I wanted to make sure Aretha knew what the scene was about. Her people said I was fine and to stop asking. It made me love her forever because then I could be like, ‘Aretha Franklin, who sings a lot of gospel music, is very supportive of this.&apos;”

Scandal co-star Tony Goldwyn, who plays U.S. President Fitzgerald Grant was partially upset about Clinton’s election loss.

“We were all very upset,” Goldwyn said.

Goldwyn, who was giddy to meet Clinton when she visited the Scandal set in Los Angeles last February, was featured in a pro-Hillary Clinton campaign ad and lauded the former Democratic nominee at the DNC.

“We’d worked hard to get Hillary elected.”

Today&apos;s the day Nevada! Let&apos;s get out there and caucus!!! #UseYourVoice #ImWithHer @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/EyFLecI0T7 — Tony Goldwyn (@tonygoldwyn) February 20, 2016

Rhimes says Scandal in the era of Trump is harder than she had imagined and will be challenging to reconcile going forward.

“Any of the stories we planned now just feel like we’re copying what’s happening in reality, which is insane,” she said. “I used to know how it ended, and then Donald Trump was elected. We had a destination, and I don’t know if that’s our destination anymore.”

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel says it’s in Germany’s interest to have good relations with the United States, despite disagreeing with President Donald Trump on important issues.

Merkel told Germany’s Funke media group in an interview published Thursday that conversations with Trump during her visit to Washington and in subsequent phone calls had been “good.”

She added “this naturally doesn’t rule out that we have different opinions on some points, including on important questions.”

Merkel acknowledged that military action against the Islamic State group was necessary, but said only a political solution would bring about lasting peace in Syria and Iraq. She said an expansion of Germany’s contribution in the fight against extremists groups “isn’t up for debate.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6755f38e:e17732:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” conservative commentator Ann Coulter, author of “In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” took aim at President Donald Trump’s apparent shift in foreign policy.

Coulter told host Tucker Carlson that Trump’s decision to launch an attack on an airbase in Syria “very strange” and described it as a “departure” from his campaign rhetoric.

“Well, I knew there was going to be massive pushback for everything Trump proposes to do on immigration,” she said. “I didn’t realize that the pushback would be as strong for not starting pointless wars. You would think that would have been one of the simplest things to do. But, it’s been interesting watching so many of these generals straight out of Dr. Strangelove pushing for war with Syria, war with Russia, war with North Korea. I thought General Mattis’ statement, the secretary of defense, was a fantastic yesterday. And that seem to be returning to the Trump policy on the campaign, which is — I mean, how many times a day does he have to say it? He is not running to be president of the world, but president of America. He puts our interests first.”

“And yet, it’s a very hard explain the Syrian attack,” she continued. “And it’s certainly not a vital national security interest. We generally don’t, at least conservatives don’t, rushing around the world for humanitarian reasons. And for that region of the world, Assad is one of the better leaders. There are probably only one or two better than he. He’s not even like a Saddam Hussain murderous thug. He helped us after 9/11, giving us intelligence. It’s a very strange thing we’ve done here. And I feel like it’s such a departure from what Trump said on the campaign trail. And in 2013 on his Twitter feed.”

President Donald Trump announced in an interview with Fox Business Wednesday morning that he does not intend to ask FBI Director James Comey to resign and did not do so at the start of his administration because he wanted “to give everybody a good, fair chance.”

Trump said Comey “saved Hillary Clinton” by recommending that there be no criminal charges against her for her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state.

“I have confidence in him. We will see what happens. You know, it’s going to be interesting,” Trump told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “Don’t forget, when Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton. People don’t realize that. He saved her life. I call it ‘Comey I.’ And I joke about it a little bit.”

Comey essentially exonerated Clinton of criminal wrongdoing in a press conference and then announced in a letter to Congress that the FBI found potentially new evidence related to Clinton’s private email server. Days later, Comey announced that the new evidence did not change the FBI’s conclusion that Clinton would not face charges.

When Bartiromo asked Trump whether it was too late in his presidency to ask Comey to step down, Trump said it was not.

In March, Comey testified before Congress about the FBI’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the president’s allegation that former President Barack Obama illegally wiretapped him inside Trump Tower during the presidential campaign.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b65548775:ace04f:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The same U.S. Navy seal squad that killed al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden is reportedly training to assassinate the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un amid rising tensions in the region.

Local media reports claim that Seal Team 6, the team which killed bin Laden in May 2011, have been deployed to South Korea where they are participating in the Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercise taking place in the region.

Although the Pentagon would not confirm the reports, they said that “ground, air, naval and special operations” are carrying out “several joint and combined field training operations” with up to 17,000 troops.

According to South Korean newspaper JoongAng Daily, Seal Team 6 are simulating drills in which they would take out the North Korean leader as well as neutralize weapons of mass destructions, something which was confirmed by the South Korean defense ministry back in March.

However, U.S. Navy Commander Gary Ross denied these claims. Ross, discussing the military exercises in March, said that “There are a variety of Special Operations Forces (SOF) participating in Foal Eagle, as they do in most regional exercises.”

“Foal Eagle is a regularly-scheduled, annual exercise that is the culmination of many months of planning and it is not being conducted in response to the current situation on the peninsula,” he continued.

The reports come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea and a month after the U.S. placed a THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea.

On Wednesday, Donald Trump warned Kim Jong-un that he was “doing the wrong thing” by threatening the United States, adding that he was deploying an “armada” into the region, although he remained secretive about his broader military strategy.

“We are sending an armada. Very powerful,” Trump said during an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That, I can tell you.”

Remind me again: Who is the impulsive, trigger-happy pugnacious brute who cannot be trusted with the nuclear codes?

It’s Donald Trump, according to universal bipartisan proclamations from establishment Washington lifers who broke into such hysterics over a gauche real estate titan who thought he could do their job better than them.

These people should know, considering they are the same people who have managed to keep America at a constant state of war for about 15 years now. These people cannot agree on pretty much anything else. But spending gobs of money policing the world with never-ending foreign wars? They suddenly break out in hot pulsating bipartisanship.

So perhaps it should come as little surprise that these people who so loathed Donald Trump the candidate are so thrilled with Donald Trump the president for firing 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles into a Syrian civil war that American voters are pretty adamant about staying out of.

The sudden applause for Mr. Trump came from the strangest corners of the political world.

The Senate’s “renegade” rogue Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham — ardent foes of Mr. Trump during the campaign — commended him for his warrior bluster.

“Unlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,” they said. “For that, he deserves the support of the American people.”

Even Sen. Marco Rubio — famously dubbed “Little Marco” — cheered the president for “acting decisively.”

“President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over,” Little Marco said.

Across the aisle, even Democrats were gushing over the expensive military intervention.

“Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer enthused.

Even Hillary Clinton hopped aboard the Trump Train for bombing Syria. Her only complaint seemed to be that Mr. Trump may not have gone far enough.

“I believe that we should have, and still should, take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them,” she said.

This is the same Hillary Clinton who warned us in the most alarming terms during the campaign that under no circumstances should Mr. Trump be trusted with America’s war-making arsenal.

“This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,” she said last summer. “It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.”

Well, apparently Syrian dictator Bashar Assad got under Mr. Trump’s very thin skin, and Mrs. Clinton’s only complaint now is he didn’t go far enough.

Breitbart Chief White House Correspondent Charlie Spiering didn’t back down when CNN’s Jim Acosta claimed at an event on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. that members of the media should get along, even if they have ideological differences.

“I’d love for all of us to get away from this day where we’re just ripping each other apart because of political differences,” Acosta said on a panel at the Newseum focused on the press coverage of the presidency. “I think good people can disagree on the issues and it’s time for good people to disagree in a civil way about how the news is covered in this country.”

“I’d love to see it down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue, and I’d love to see it at places like Breitbart and perhaps our folks can do a better job at that as well,” Acosta said.

“Well, I think that the sort of go along, get along, everyone gets along climate in Washington, D.C. is what Americans are tired of,” Spiering said. “They’re tired of the closeness of the news media with the officials they cover. They’re tired of the stories of everybody hanging out and going out to dinners and partying.”

Spiering was interrupted by Julie Pace of the Associated Press.

“That happens with Republicans and Democrats too, to be fair,” Pace said. “I mean it’s not as though reporters are hanging out with only Democrats. We have dinners and lunches and coffees with Republicans as well.”

“Right, but it’s part of the establishment,” Spiering responded. “It’s part of the swamp that, you know, the Trump supporters were very sick of.”

Spiering said that the liberal media have a “hostile tone” when reporting on Trump — a much different tone then when covering those who share their worldview, like when reporting on Susan Rice and the recent controversy over her role in unmasking the names of certain people in the Trump campaign picked up in intelligence reports.

“I think what upsets a lot of our readers is when you hear the media being so willing to exonerate Susan Rice, as Jim just did, and they take a completely hostile tone towards the president. But when it comes to people like Susan Rice, they’re not taking the same tone of hostility, and a lot of the news that they publish on that — I think a lot of our readers see that as sort of coming from one side,” Spiering said.

“This is why our readers are so comfortable with the president describing the media as the opposition party,” Spiering said. “They’re getting most of their talking points — a good portion of their sources — from their Democratic friends.

“They didn’t vote for the president,” Spiering said. “They don’t know too many of the president’s supporters, and I think there is a difference in tone coming from the mainstream media versus Breitbart.”

“We’re not the opposition party,” Acosta said. “We are just trying to get at the truth. And when you have a side of the news media that just insists time and again that CNN is out to get the president or out to get certain people in this country, I think it just does a tremendous disservice to all Americans,” he added.

Spiering and Breitbart were also praised during the panel discussion by Glenn Thrush, White House Correspondent for the New York Times.

“Listening to Charlie talk about the notion, the prospect, of having Breitbart holding President Trump accountable for his campaign promises to me is fantastic,” Thrush said. “And I think represents to me — it’s why I love media — and by the way, I’m the exact opposite of Trump on this. I love reporters of all stripes working for all organizations.”

“I feel the lowliest reporter is morally superior to the most exalted flak — that is my sense — and the notion of the conservative media, the ideological media holding the president that they helped elect accountable to me — it’s the ultimate validation of the way that the system is supposed to work,” Thrush said. “I just think it is awesome.”

Wednesday at LaGuardia Community College in New York, former 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton criticized President Donald Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Clinton said, “Now, I’m hoping too that the Congress will come to its senses and will understand that we don’t need to be building walls—we need to be building bridges. And the best bridge to the future is a good education, my friends.”

President Donald Trump denounced the incident in which a passenger was injured after being dragged off a United Airlines flight on Wednesday, describing it as “horrible.”

A video of a bloodied man being dragged off a flight sparked international outrage, after nobody volunteered to give up their seat on the flight, which was overbooked.

However, Trump rejected Gov. Chris Christie’s call for regulations preventing airlines from overselling flights, instead suggesting that there should be no upper limit for the value of vouchers given to passengers to get them to give up their seats.

“You know, there’s a point at which I’m getting off the plane—seriously,” Trump said. “They should have gone up higher. But to just randomly say, ‘You’re getting off the plane,’ that was terrible.”

President Donald Trump softened his position on China, citing the need for them to help the United States deal with the threat posed by North Korea.

“They’re not currency manipulators,” Trump said, referring to China in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.

During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed in his Contract with America that he would “direct the Secretary of Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.”

A U.S. Treasury spokesman confirmed to Reuters that they will not name China as a currency manipulator in their upcoming report.

During his press conference on Wednesday at the White House, Trump said he had a productive meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last weekend at his Mar-a-lago estate.

“President Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding. I think we had a very good chemistry together,” he said. “I think he wants to help us with North Korea.”

Trump added that if China helped address the North Korea threat, he might be more open to a better trade deal with China.

“We talked trade. We talked a lot of things. And I said, the way you’re going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea; otherwise we’re just going to go it alone,” he said. “That will be all right, too.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b64b1900d:9f7dce:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A new survey from CNBC shows that Americans are highly optimistic about the economy and strongly support for President Donald Trump’s economic agenda.

The “CNBC All American Survey” recorded the highest level of economic optimism in its 10 year existence. Thirty-eight percent of the public say the economy is good or excellent, a four point improvement from December. Forty percent expect the economy to improve over the next year, which is close to the record set in 2010–when the economy was in truly dire straits.

The survey also shows overwhelmingly strong support for Trump’s plans to improve America’s infrastructure, cut taxes, and renegotiate trade deals. Nearly 75 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s infrastructure improvement plans, with just around 10 percent disapproving. More than 60 percent of the public endorse plans to cut individual taxes, with just over 20 percent opposing. Renegotiating trade deals is favored by 58 percent of the public, and opposed by just over 25 percent.

Reducing taxes also wins the approval of most Americans, but it generates opposition from over a third of the public. Cutting business regulations has an approval rating in the high forties, and a disapproval rating in the mid-thirties.

The results on trade show that while Americans are divided over the benefits of free trade–34 percent say it helps the U.S. and 31 percent say it hurts–they aren’t divided on the president’s efforts to strike better trade deals. According to CNBC’s Steve Liesman, even Americans who like free trade say they approve of those efforts.

Fifty-one percent of Republicans say that they want their party to “work to pass Trump’s agenda” rather than “hold the line on conservative positions.” Democrats divide nearly evenly on whether their party should compromise with the president.

The president’s personal popularity is far weaker than his economic agenda. Just 39 percent say they approve of how he is doing his job, compared with 48 percent who disapprove, and 13 percent who said they don’t know or were unsure.

One reason for this may be that many of the most public actions taken by the Trump administration have been in areas where public support is weaker. Nearly half of Americans say they disagree with the Trump administration’s attempt to replace Obamacare. The border wall also divides Americans, with slightly more Americans opposing it than supporting it, according to the CNBC survey. Efforts to rollback some of the Obama administration’s policies on climate change also have more opposition than support.

The survey is not perfect. It’s results show that nearly half of Americans oppose Trump’s “Immigration Ban,” when there was no ban on immigration. Instead, the administration tried to put in place a temporary halt on travel from certain countries. Perhaps the actual question asked, which CNBC has not released, was less contentious.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b64a4731e:9e6b89:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Pres.

Wednesday at a joint press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump, who had previously called NATO “obsolete,” said the organization was “no longer obsolete.”

Trump said, “The secretary-general and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism. I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change. Now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete.”

The Trump White House lifted the restriction on hiring federal workers. In exchange, federal agencies must submit plans to cut waste, fraud, and abuse from their budgets.

The administration’s push to reorganize the federal government and cut wasteful practices serves as a centerpiece of Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp.”

“The government reorg is probably the biggest story nobody is talking about,” Mick Mulvaney told reporters on Tuesday. “We’re trying to do something that’s never been done.”

In January, President Trump issued an executive order freezing all federal hiring and told budget director Mulvaney to recommend a long-term plan to reduce the federal workforce after the 90-day hiring freeze.

Mulvaney said that the federal hiring freeze would lift on Wednesday. Agencies can hire, but they must submit plans to make their offices more efficient.

Agencies will send their drafts in June, with final drafts submitted in September. Mulvaney said, “You can’t just wave a magic wand in the Oval Office and do these things.”

Mulvaney explained that significant changes to agency staff would have to be approved by Congress, and would be “hard-wired” into the budget for fiscal year 2019.

Mulvaney said that he invites ideas with an open mind. President Trump wishes to remake the federal government from scratch, without being tied to precedent or budget processes.

Mulvaney said, “This is a big part of draining the swamp. What you’re talking about doing is restructuring Washington, D.C. and that is how you drain the swamp … This is a centerpiece of his campaign and a centerpiece of his administration.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b64a4731e:9e6b86:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">From American Greatness:

Before the election Scarborough repeatedly warned Republicans to cut and run from their nominee. In August, he gravely warned that for Republicans the election is “about saving the Senate, it’s about not getting wiped out in the House, it’s about not getting wiped out in the state legislatures and governorships. We have a lot to lose.”

Instead, Republicans won big in 2016 with Donald Trump. Not only did Donald Trump beat down the Democrats’ vaunted Blue Wall of states from Wisconsin to North Carolina and win the White House, Republicans also retained control of both Houses of Congress and expanded their already impressive dominance at the state level—leaving wise men like Joe Scarborough with egg on their faces. As a result of last year’s election Republicans now control 32 governorships and 67 of 98 partisan state legislatures and have a trifecta (control of the governor and both state houses) in 25 states. In the year of Donald Trump, Republicans even won the governor’s mansion in deep blue Vermont. So much for Scarborough’s insight into the American electorate.

But he stills wants us to take him seriously when he says that Steve Bannon is stupid and can’t implement the putting together of a ham sandwich. Yet Scarborough’s only claim to authority is that he had a brief stint as a Congressman and now has a show on MSNBC. That show is, presumably, built around his alleged insights or practical wisdom. That is, at best, a tautology.

…

It may have escaped the notice of folks who appear regularly on Morning Joe, but Bannon and Co. won. What’s more they tapped into an innate political sensibility that bridges the Right-Left political settlement that has ruled for the past 30 years and, in so doing, they threaten the established political order.

But in Joe Scarborough’s world Bannon, who got the election right, is “stupid.” The 2016 election was about one thing: Who rules? Will it be the permanent political class or the people.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b63f477f2:8dc1a9:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

CNN host Jake Tapper tells the Hollywood Reporter that his “dream” interview subject is Russian President Vladimir Putin — after a dose of sodium thiopental, a drug often depicted as a “truth serum” in fiction.

In a roundtable with four other “top TV broadcasters” — ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, NBC’s Savannah Guthrie, CBS’s Gayle King, and Fox News’s Bret Baier — Tapper jokingly hoped that he could uncover real Truth from Putin with the help of barbiturates.

Final question: Who would you most like to interview? … TAPPER Are these interviews-interviews or are they sodium pentothal [a trademarked name for the compound] interviews? (Laughter.) I mean, as long as we’re doing a dream [interview], a Putin interview with sodium pentothal would be fantastic.

Tapper’s network CNN has doggedly pursued a conspiracy theory that President Trump and his associates are pawns in an international plot led by Putin. CNN was the first outlet to report on a dossier that claimed Russia had gathered blackmail material on Donald Trump before he ran for office, stating that intelligence officers briefed the then-President-Elect on these specific claims. Following CNN’s lead, the advertorial hub/social justice blog BuzzFeed published this unverified dossier in full — quite obviously to air claims that Trump has a urine fetish. NBC later quashed CNN’s reporting, writing that the dossier was appended to Trump’s daily intel briefing as an example of “unvetted disinformation.”

Tapper himself appears to be a true believer that Russia “influenced” the 2016 election and displays a very healthy interest in the topic, calling several detractors “Russian trolls.”

An estimated 4,000 Somali migrants in the U.S. are expected to be deported by President Donald Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

In an interview, Somalia’s Ambassador to the U.S. Ahmed Isse Awad said the number of Somalis ICE is looking to deport is at least 4,000, with the vast majority not being currently held in immigration detention centers.

“We learned through immigration sources that the total number of the Somalis that are in the books of [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to be removed are close to 4,000,” Awad told Voice of America.

Over the course of the next few months, Awad said some 300 Somalis would be deported, saying he was waiting for information as to who those deportees would be.

The numbers released by the ambassador show a steep departure from the days of lax immigration enforcement under the Bush and Obama Administrations.

Awad said that during Obama’s last two years in office, only 170 Somalis were deported for either committing crimes or having their asylum requests rejected.

The Trump Administration is expected to double that number in a few months.

In a recent east coast operation, ICE arrested 82 criminal illegal immigrants, including two criminal aliens who were suspected of being MS-13 gang members, with ties to the El Salvadorian organization, Breitbart Texas reported.

A new survey shows widespread support for President Donald Trump’s plan to swap current U.S. immigration policy, based on family-ties, toward entry based on skills and merit.

In a Rasmussen Reports poll, 44 percent of likely American voters want to move to a merit-based immigration system that only admits legal immigrants if their skills are needed in the U.S.

Only 37 percent of likely voters want to keep the current legal immigration system which is based solely on family chain migration. Another 18 percent of likely voters said they did not know which system they would prefer.

Men, as well as younger likely voters, much prefer a merit-based immigration system, with 51 percent saying they would like to see a switch, as opposed to 38 percent of women. Voters between the ages 18 to 30 favored a merit system by 49 percent. Voters from 40 to 64 preferred the status quo by 43 percent.

While Trump’s merit-based plan is wildly popular with 60 percent of Republicans, likely voters who do not identify with either of the two major political parties show 47 percent support as well.

The poll also found that Americans continue to support deportations of illegal immigrants, even if the illegal immigrant has a child in the U.S.

Forty-five percent of likely voters said illegal immigrants with children born in the U.S. should not be exempt from deportation. Only 37 percent disagreed.

Across party lines, deportations of illegal immigrants with children remains popular, with 62 percent of Republicans supporting the action, along with 30 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of American voters who are not affiliated with either major political party.

U.S. President Donald Trump, in an exclusive interview on Fox Business, described Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad as a “butcher” and “truly an evil person,” noting that the relationship between Syria and Russia is “bad for mankind.”

Watch the latest video at &lt;a href=“//video.foxbusiness.com”&gt;video.foxbusiness.com&lt;/a&gt;

Nevertheless, America’s commander-in-chief added that the United States has no plans to enter Syria.

“We’re not going into Syria,” President Trump told Maria Bartiromo from FOX Business. “But when I see people using horrible, horrible chemical weapons… and see these beautiful kids that are dead in their father’s arms, or you see kids gasping for life… when you see that, I immediately called General [James] Mattis.”

Mattis serves as Trump’s secretary of Defense.

Watch the latest video at &lt;a href=”//video.foxbusiness.com”&gt;video.foxbusiness.com&lt;/a&gt;

The U.S. president’s comments came nearly a week after he ordered U.S. airstrikes against an Assad base in Syria in response to the dictator’s use of chemical weapons in a rebel-held part of northern Syria.

“What I did should have been done by the Obama administration a long time before I did it,” he told Fox Business. “I think Syria would be a lot better off right now than it has been.”

“People just don’t see this — the level of brutality. The level of viciousness. But when they drop barrel bombs and bombs of any kind right on top of the civilian population,” declared President Trump, referring to the Syrian dictator’s attacks on his own people, “that’s the worst thing. I’ve never seen anything like it and frankly, Putin is backing a person that’s truly an evil person. And I think it’s very bad for Russia. I think it’s very bad for mankind. It’s very bad for this world.”

Assad considers all Syrian opposition forces to be terrorists.

“I think aligning yourself with Assad is a big mistake because he’s a butcher, and I think it’s very bad for Russia,” Trump said, addressing Putin.

Russia doubled down on its support for Assad before and after the recent U.S. airstrikes.

On Wednesday, Putin said U.S.-Russian relations have worsened under President Trump’s watch.

“It can be said that the level of trust at the working level, especially at the military level, has not become better but most likely has degraded,” President Putin told a Russian state television channel.

Wednesday marks the beginning of an intense day of diplomacy in Moscow for U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, notes CBS News.

Russia and the United States have been condemning one another since the Trump administration bombed Assad last week.

Putin has stood by allegations that the Assad regime was framed for the chemical weapons assault, that killed as many as 100 people, including at least 27 children, and wounded hundreds more.

On Tuesday, the White House declassified a report containing evidence from U.S. intelligence and other sources accusing Putin of a cover-up intended to “confuse” and “obfuscate” on behalf of Assad.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6350f66c:7cce51:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Wednesday, despite reports that the Kremlin leader had refused a face-to-face meeting with the top American diplomat, reveal various Russian state media outlets.

“Russian President Vladimir Putin is meeting US Secretary of State Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister [Sergey] Lavrov at the Kremlin,” said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Russian president, on Wednesday, without elaborating on what they would discuss.

“We have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the president’s diary,” Peskov told reporters on Monday, dismissing the potential for such a meeting. He added that “returning to pseudo-attempts to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that Assad must step down cannot help sort things out,” suggesting a meeting between Tillerson and Putin would be unproductive given the current political climate.

The revelation comes on the heels of Russian President Putin declaring that U.S.-Russian relations have worsened under American President Donald Trump’s watch.

“It can be said that the level of trust at the working level, especially at the military level, has not become better but most likely has degraded,” President Putin told a Russian state television channel.

Before meeting with Putin, Tillerson held discussions with his counterpart Lavrov. Secretary Tillerson arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, becoming first Trump official to visit Russia.

President Putin presented Secretary Tillerson with the Russian Order of Friendship award in 2013.

The unscheduled meeting between Tillerson and Putin comes amid heightened tensions between the United States and Russia over Syria.

Last week, President Trump ordered airstrikes on assets linked to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in response to the regime’s use of chemical weapons in a rebel-held area in the northern part of the war-devastated country.

Since the U.S. airstrikes, U.S. and Russia have been trading barbs.

While the United States has accused Assad of carrying out the chemical attacks last week that killed as many as 100, including children, and wounded hundreds of others, Russia has defended the Syrian leader and deemed the U.S. strike an act of international aggression.

In a recent interview with Fox Business, President Trump described Assad as a “butcher” and “truly an evil man,” adding that the relationship between Russia and Syria is “bad for mankind.”

“Putin is backing a person [Assad] that’s truly an evil person. And I think it’s very bad for Russia. I think it’s very bad for mankind. It’s very bad for this world,” proclaimed Trump, adding, “I think aligning yourself [Putin] with Assad is a big mistake because he’s a butcher.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6350f66c:7cce50:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union chairman and co-host of SiriusXM Patriot’s “CPAC 365” spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow today regarding the special election in Kansas’s 4th District.

Republican Ron Estes, the state treasurer, won a special election Tuesday night in Kansas to replace Rep. Mike Pompeo, who became President Donald Trump’s CIA director, CNN projects.

Estes defeated Democrat Jim Thompson, a civil rights attorney and Army veteran, and Libertarian Chris Rockhold.

Said Schlapp, citing the dynamics on the ground in the race, the electorate “is in a fighting mood.”

“Conservatives feel less attached to the Republican Party,” he added. “Republicans might characterize this as a dangerous time. I would characterize it as a time of great upheaval and change.”

Said Schlapp, “This is a warning shot to all members of Congress who are used to winning their districts pretty easily. People aren’t going to take the same old answers.”

Dr. Sebastian Gorka, former Breitbart News National Security editor and current deputy assistant to President Trump, discussed Syria policy on Wednesday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily.

SiriusXM host Alex Marlow suggested there were too many conflicting statements coming from various Trump administration officials about Syria, but Gorka insisted “we have absolute clarity.”

“You just have to listen to the president, the Commander-in-Chief,” he advised. “He has been explicit, and nothing has changed from November the 8th to today.”

“We sent a very clear message concerning the use of weapons of mass destruction against women and children, but the president has said we have no interest in invading other people’s countries and occupying them. This isn’t the Bush administration of 2003, nor is it the first Gulf War of 1991. These things are very, very clear,” Gorka asserted.

Marlow countered by playing a clip of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seeming to endorse regime change in Syria. “I think it’s clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” Tillerson declared.

Gorka said it was “not a binary proposition” to call for regime change without also committing the United States to a military intervention.

“Nothing that Secretary Tillerson said has anything to do with an invasion or forced removal of Assad. Nothing,” he said. “Everybody’s on the same sheet of music, whether it’s the Secretary of State, whether it’s Secretary Mattis, whether it’s General McMaster the National Security Adviser. They all follow the lead of the Commander-in-Chief.”

“There’s more than one way – there are dozens of different ways that one individual can step down from power. He doesn’t have to be removed,” Gorka argued. “That’s why the action we took last Thursday was so seminal. We sent a message to the sponsors of this regime.”

“Remember this is a satrapy, it’s a client state of other nations,” he explained. “The message we sent is, there is a point at which an individual like Assad, when he does things as heinous as using chemical weapons against unarmed women and children, the cost/benefit analysis for his sponsors – Moscow included – has to be reassessed.”

“When that is reassessed, if he loses the sponsorship of places like the Kremlin, it becomes much easier for him to be forced out of office politically, not by force, because he simply loses the confidence of his supporters and also the people around him. Remember, Alex, Assad is just one man. He doesn’t have to be removed through force. He can be removed politically. We went a great distance towards that political resolution by the actions we took last week,” said Gorka.

Marlow noted that much of President Trump’s voting base was “not expecting him to proactively get involved in foreign entanglements that did not directly impact the national security of America.”

“Number One, this did impact our national security directly,” Gorka responded. “Whether you live in San Bernardino, Boston, or whether you live anywhere else in the United States, the idea that you have the free use of chemical weapons in a war zone – where ISIS, our primary threat, is recruiting, is functioning, can access those weapons – that is a primary threat to the United States.”

“Secondly, this isn’t a ‘foreign entanglement’ in the way that our Founding Fathers described it,” he continued. “I say to your listeners, and this is a very important question – I understand the concerns, but really the people who voted for the president should not be concerned.”

“Just compare the difference between two things: the invasion of 150, 160 thousand soldiers and Marines into a given theater, whether it’s Gulf I, whether it’s 2003 – compare that please to the launching of 59 vehicles from the Med, from a ship in absolute safety, targeting one airfield used to launch those weapons,” he urged. “These two things are incomparable, and let’s have a little bit of sophistication in our analysis. One does not lead to the other.”

Marlow mentioned fears that even if American military actions remain as limited and low-risk as Gorka described, there was still a danger we could be pressed into service as “the world’s policeman,” with an enormous number of atrocities around the world demanding our attention.

“There is no intent, no desire, no endgame that involves us being a global police officer. Absolutely not,” Gorka replied.

“With regard to the awful things that happen in mass numbers every day around the world, we have a different perspective,” he continued. “It’s not the last eight years, when the Obama administration looked at the world as it would like it to be, as opposed to how it is. This president is a pragmatist. You don’t get to be the most successful real estate mogul in New York, the toughest market in America, for 40 years unless you are a pragmatist.”

“We are interested in the overlap between moral imperative and national security. Strategy is exactly like politics: it is the art of the possible. We take action not because there is a global interest; we take action because there is a national security interest, which sometimes may overlap with the global interest with regard to human rights or the use of chemical weapons,” Gorka said.

“The primary driving metric for everything the president does, because this is his primary mission, is the safety of the American people. In this case, this has nothing to do with being a globocop. This has to do with ISIS in theater, weapons of mass destruction, and the stability of the Middle East,” he stressed.

Marlow said the Trump voting base was also wary of increased tensions with Russia, and was hoping the Russians could prove useful in defeating the Islamic State once and for all. He asked if the increasingly adversarial relationship between Presidents Trump and Putin was a response to “CNN conspiracy theories” about Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Gorka responded by emphasizing Trump’s instincts as a pragmatist.

“The statements coming out of Moscow should not be taken at face value. Remember who Putin was. Remember what this regime has done in the last 12 years,” he added.

Gorka quoted Trump’s response to a question at a press conference about relations with Russia: “I would like, if possible, to have good relations with Moscow. Right now, it doesn’t really seem like that’s possible. If that’s the case, so be it.”

“We do not make the national security interests of the United States hostage to other people’s opinions and propaganda,” he declared. “As a result, the president will keep his course.”

Marlow brought up White House spokesman Sean Spicer’s now-infamous gaffe comparing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to Adolf Hitler, and said he hoped no one in the White House seriously thought Assad was in a league with Hitler.

“Of course not,” Gorka replied. “Let’s close down the conspiracy theories.”

Marlow said it would not be easy to make the Left take that advice, because they are in “total meltdown over this, hysteria mode, even accusing him of Holocaust denial.”

“I’m used to it. This is what we’ve been living with for 12 weeks now: the absolutely mind-bendingly absurd fixation on half-sentences, short little clips of interviews taken out of context to spin up fake news,” Gorka sighed.

“Everybody knows that Sean misspoke, and he stated so,” he continued. “I want to say one thing to my colleague Sean, and everybody I think knows this: outside of the Oval Office, Sean Spicer is a great patriot, a great American, probably has the toughest job in America. If you offered me that job, I wouldn’t take it with a gun to my head. We have to recognize his professionalism. Sometimes you stumble, and he did yesterday, but he’s made up for it. Let’s move on.”

Turning to North Korea, Gorka reiterated his often-stated determination not to “give away the playbook” on strategy, but allowed that there was a “similar dynamic” with North Korea and Syria.

“North Korea doesn’t function without sponsorship, and we know who sponsors it,” he elaborated. “We are reasserting American leadership in the world. We’re filling the vacuum created by the last administration everywhere, including in Asia.”

“I’ll simply put it this way: our actions are a forceful expression of our intent to provide leadership in the world and stability. We have anti-status-quo actors. North Korea is one of them. Our actions send a very clear message to those people that sponsor rogue regimes like North Korea, that they too – like Russia with regard to Syria – have to reassess their cost/benefit analysis, and the calculation of how long they should support regimes like North Korea. Because North Korea is a destabilizing factor for all the nations of the region, and is a threat. That’s the message we’re sending,” said Gorka.

Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions explained to host Sean Hannity how border security has changed since President Donald Trump took office nearly three months ago.

Sessions went on to add it was the intention of the Trump administration to send the message the border was not open.

“[C]an you believe that we have had the lowest number of entrances at the border in 17 years? This is the direct result of Donald Trump’s strong, clear leadership. It has an impact. The most important thing for us is to send a message to the world that the border is not open. Please don’t come. You will be apprehended if you do come, and you will be deported promptly. And if you’re a criminal, you’ll be prosecuted. And if you assault our officers, we’re going to come at you with a ton of bricks. This is the kind of message we need to send. It is already being sent. It is having a dramatic effect so far. I knew strong presidential leadership unlike the wishy-washiness we’ve seen in the past would impact the flow, but not as much as we’ve seen already. The numbers are down 70 percent since President Obama left office. It is really a remarkable achievement.”

Frank Gaffney, Center for Security Policy president, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss Gaffney’s warning that things can get worse in Syria.

“The Syria situation is one that is fraught with peril, as I see it, for the United States at this particular moment in time,” Gaffney explained. “Because President Trump seems sorely tempted – and I think that tempting is not simply a function of the usual suspects, people who have been horrified by the humanitarian crisis there, the people there who think that it will be resolved, or at least diminished, by bringing Heaven knows how many refugees from Syria here and the like – but now from his own national security team that we must get involved, we must inject ourselves into the crisis in Syria.”

“I think that’s folly,” he said. “It’s not because I’m indifferent to the suffering of the people there. It’s that I don’t see a good solution for, frankly, either the people of Syria or their neighbors or for us by making America part of this civil war.”

Gaffney said his specific concern is that “the idea that Assad is Hitler or something akin to him and must go, and Russia must help with that, raises, inevitably, the question: so what do we want there next?”

“The choices, unfortunately, seem to be more of the same. At best, it’s an Assad-Lite, supported by the Russians, supported presumably by the Iranians, supported by Hezbollah. Or, alternatively, it’s sharia supremacists of the Sunni stripe supported by the Saudis, supported by the Turks, supported by perhaps al-Qaeda or the Islamic State, or simply the Muslim Brotherhood. All very bad choices, in my judgment,” he said.

Gaffney noted Russia has some concrete interests in Syria, including a warm-water port in the Mediterranean.

“They have had the use of an airfield there as well. It’s been sort of a foothold for most of this period, certainly since ’67,” he said. “That’s been pretty much it for the Russians. They kind of lost their client relationship with the Egyptians. The United States became the dominant power in the Middle East. That base was important, and it remains so today. I think it’s been an incredibly critical vehicle for Putin to re-insert himself, not just into Syria, but into the Middle East more generally during the Obama years. So it’s a big deal, certainly, for the Russians.”

“It’s been the difference between holding on to power, perhaps even re-establishing his claim to much of Syria, and either death at the hands of the mob, as Qaddafi experienced, or exile for Bashar Assad,” he added.

Marlow noted the lack of consistency in comments from various Trump administration sources about Syria, making it difficult to judge if removing Assad from power is an active goal of the United States or how much military involvement with Syria might be on the horizon.

“Putting the best face on it, Alex, as you know, Donald Trump indicated that he was going to be unpredictable to our allies, and most especially to our enemies overseas,” Gaffney replied. “He thought that that was a virtue. And arguably it is, at least in a tactical sense.”

“But what you’re describing is part of what worries me,” he continued. “I’m afraid that in the absence of clarity about what we’re doing, you may well see the president do what he did last week – which is on the basis, it seems as much as anything, of the horrific imagery on television of children being gassed, he decided he was going to depart from what he said repeatedly was going to be his policy and inject himself at least in that very tactical way, in retaliation against the gas attack.”

“Here’s the kicker: the president is perilously close in some of these comments, particularly by some subordinates, to embracing what the Obama administration actually formally embraced, which is the so-called ‘duty to protect’ that is a formula for having the United States essentially become, if not the policeman of the world, the punisher of bad people around the world, without regard for the vital interests of the United States and the other demands on our resources – military and economic and so on,” he said.

“This is a moment for real care to be exercised,” Gaffney advised. “I think, as usual, I find myself much more sympathetic to the views that we’re hearing attributed to Steve Bannon, who seems to be kinda holding back on some of this stuff. But let’s face it, pressure is on from General McMaster, the national security adviser; General Mattis, the secretary of defense, and others – certainly the whole coterie of Obama holdovers who would love to see this president become embroiled in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake.”

Marlow asked about rumors that President Trump’s decision to strike the Syrian airbase was influenced by emotional responses to pictures of suffering Syrian children from members of his family.

“It’s not to say that that’s not a perfectly responsible and even humane reaction to the horrors that we’re seeing,” Gaffney said. “It’s just to say, is it consistent with our national interests? I think keeping people from using weapons of mass destruction is consistent with our national interests, and I think that’s sort of the underlying rationale beyond that humanitarian response. But we’ve got to be thinking more strategically.”

“Let me just throw one idea out that I think it’s high time we begin to address,” he offered. “There is in this mix that I mentioned mostly bad actors. There’s a group that has generally been very responsible, very helpful to us and I think a force for good in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. And that’s the Kurds.”

“I think one of the things that, as the administration thinks strategically about what the end state is that they’d like to see, everything ought to be on the table, as they say. One is redrawing the maps to recognize reality. There is no homeland for the ethnic population that is arguably the largest dispossessed people in that part of the world, namely the Kurds,” he elaborated.

“I personally think the President of the United States ought to be thinking about a Kurdistan in at least the parts of Syria – and maybe even Iraq or Iran for that matter – that are Kurdish, that have the opportunity or the basis for being safe havens for minorities that are currently very much at risk and are being helped by the Kurds,” he suggested. “This is a place where some creative thinking is warranted and might actually have a strategic value, whereas just responding willy-nilly to the humanitarian crisis du jour is a formula for squandering resources and lives, probably American ones.”

“If we wind up embracing the Obama and U.N. idea of a ‘responsibility to protect,’ all bets are off on an America First sort of approach, either to national security or to rebuilding on the home front because there is no end of need-to-protect people in all kinds of places,” Gaffney warned.

“I think the president is now being buffeted by individuals who have come in who apparently do not agree with his priority of defeating radical Islamic terrorism, as he calls it, and who have, instead, have the view that we should align ourselves with people who are the prime movers behind radical Islamic terrorism. That would include, by the way, the Saudis. It would include the Turks. It would include the Qataris and others in the region. I think that’s a grave concern,” he said.

“I think the idea that the president is going to transform the Chinese, the Russians, the North Koreans into benign actors through the force of our diplomacy or through our various emissaries going there and telling them what to do, is unlikely as well,” he judged.

“His planned and, I think, necessary focus on rebuilding what he called ‘peace through strength’ – my old boss Ronald Reagan’s philosophy of how to protect the United States – is the way forward. You can begin to perhaps moderate others’ behavior by demonstrating that you have the will, you have the capacity to be a formidable adversary, and not have to use that force or that coercive pressure on the ground,” Gaffney said.

He added a prediction that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s visit to Moscow would be “an early indicator of: is he going to be approaching that job as he did his last one, which is, essentially, as a guy who’s going to figure out how to do the bidding of the Russians – or is he going to be helping the President of the United States really institute this notion that America is a formidable force, and Putin is best advised not to be screwing around with us?”

“Again, the philosophy of peace through strength in practice – watch for it, hopefully, in Moscow,” Gaffney concluded.

President Donald Trump remained secretive about his plans to handle North Korea but admitted he was sending military forces its way.

“We are sending an armada. Very powerful,” Trump said during an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That, I can tell you.”

Trump said he would not tell the media how he was planning to respond to the ongoing bellicose rhetoric coming from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

“You never know, do you? You never know,” he said, stating that he would not be like former President Barack Obama, who would announce his attack plans in the Middle East in advance.

Bartiromo asked Trump if he believed Kim Jong-un was mentally fit to serve as the leader of North Korea.

“I don’t know,” Trump replied. “I don’t know him, but he’s doing the wrong thing.”

Trump discussed his visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week at Mar-a-lago, saying he had “good chemistry” with the leader.

“I think China can help us,” he said. “I hope China can help us.”

Trump’s negotiations with China continue, as the president revealed a phone call with the Chinese president.

“Had a very good call last night with the President of China concerning the menace of North Korea,” he announced on Twitter Wednesday morning.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b62ae7c6a:699670:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A Bureau of Land Management (BLM) internal working document that was leaked and reported on by the liberal Greenwire website spells out in detail President Donald Trump’s plan for making America great again.

It lists expanding production of domestic energy resources, supporting law enforcement, the military, and enhancing border security.

“Several conservation and government watchdog groups say they’re concerned about the direction the Bureau of Land Management is headed after a draft list of agency priorities under the Trump administration surfaced this week,” Greenwire’s E&amp;E News reported on Monday.

“The draft five-point ‘BLM Priority Work’ list, first reported on yesterday by E&amp;E News, calls for the agency to focus on increasing energy development in suitable areas of the 245 million acres BLM manages (Greenwire, April 10),” E&amp;E reported.

The document is divided into five sections — “Making America Safe through Energy Independence”; “Making America Great Through Shared Conservation Stewardship”; “Making America Safe – Restoring Our Sovereignty”; “Getting America Back to Work”; and “Serving the American Family.”

E&amp;E gathered statements from environmental activists in response to the leaked document, which it said “calls on the agency to streamline federal coal, hardrock mining, and oil and gas ‘leasing and permitting processes.’”

“It also prioritizes streamlining unspecified ‘processes’ mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as well as ‘land use planning to support energy and minerals development and other priorities,’ including ‘rights-of-way processing for pipelines, transmission lines, and solar/wind projects,’” E&amp;E reported.

Under the “Make America Safe” headline, it calls for BLM taking action to “coordinate with the Department of Defense to ensure that public lands and resources are available to support the mission of our military” and to “prioritize clearance and approval process to support Southern Border actions.”

E&amp;E illustrated its report with a photograph of the wall now in place along the U.S. border with Mexico, which Trump has vowed to expand.

The document states that BLM will “provide employment opportunities for veterans and youth to work on public lands.”

But critics of Trump’s plans expressed horror after reviewing the document.

“The Trump administration is prioritizing drilling, mining and the construction of an immoral and environmentally-destructive border wall over protecting America’s public lands and people’s health,” League of Conservation Voters Deputy Legislative Director Alex Taurel said in a statement given to E&amp;E.

“Our country’s public lands should be preserved for all people to enjoy and should not be handed over to corporate polluters,” Taurel added.

“The priorities from Trump’s Bureau of Land Management make it clear that the administration is not planning to manage our parks and other special places for the use and enjoyment of the people, but rather for the profits of corporate polluters,” Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club’s public lands protection campaign, said in a statement provided to E&amp;E.

“America’s public lands are worth much more than what lies underneath,” Manuel said. “These are the places where families spend time together, where people and wildlife both can take refuge as they enjoy and explore our wild places.”

But E&amp;E reported that a senior BLM official “defended the priority work list, telling E&amp;E News this week that it is meant to help agency staff understand that the Trump administration will prioritize the agency’s full ‘multiple-use’ mission — including increased public access and recreation — and not concentrate solely on promoting fossil fuels or any other energy development.”

Under the “Serving the American Family,” BLM included in its goals expanding recreational, hunting and wildlife conservation opportunities, working with state and local law enforcement to improve public safety and streamlining grazing permits to help American ranchers and farmers.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b62ae7c6a:69966f:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump campaigned to reduce regulations and unleash American jobs. He has unraveled the administrative state in 20 ways.

The 20 measures are:

In January, Trump signed an executive order that would cut two regulations for every new regulation proposed. Trump stated, “If there’s a new regulation, we have to knock out two.” President Trump signed an executive order advancing construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, previously blocked by the Obama administration. Subsequently, the Trump administration approved the construction of both pipelines. Trump signed an executive order in February known as “Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda.” The order will create regulatory watchdogs that will find new onerous regulations to eliminate. Trump said that “every regulation should have to pass a simple test: Does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers? If the answer is no, we will be getting rid of it and getting rid of it quickly.” Trump signed a bill that rescinds the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) broadband privacy rule that many scholars argue are duplicitous and onerous. Critics of the rule, including FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, argue that the Federal Trade Commission would be better suited to protect consumer privacy than the FCC. Katie McAuliffe, executive director for Digital Liberty, said this broadband rule “was a power grab under the guise of privacy.” Trump signed J.Res. 58, which overturns the Education Department’s rule that relates to how teacher training programs are assessed. The Washington Post explained the rule’s unpopularity: “Teachers unions said the regulations wrongly tied ratings of teacher-training programs to the performance of teachers’ students on standardized tests; colleges and states argued that the rules were onerous and expensive, and many Republicans argued that Obama’s Education Department had overstepped the bounds of executive authority.” The president signed legislation that nullifies a Department of Education rule relating to state accountability requirements. The rule concerned states’ accountability in identifying failing schools and reporting their plans for improving them to the federal government. Trump commented on rescinding both education rules, saying they “eliminate harmful burdens on state and local taxes on school systems that could have cost states hundreds of millions of dollars.” Trump signed an executive order that minimizes the burden of Obamacare. The executive order makes it harder for the IRS to enforce Obamacare’s individual mandate. Judge Andrew Napolitano called Trump’s Obamacare executive order “revolutionary.” President Trump signed an executive order killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He told Breitbart News during the campaign, “The TPP is another terrible one-sided deal that rewards offshoring and enriches other countries at our expense. I will stop Hillary’s Obamatrade in its tracks, bringing millions of new voters into the Republican Party. We will move manufacturing jobs back to the United States and we will Make America Great Again.” President Trump signed an executive order instituting a federal hiring freeze, although there is an exemption for the military. A federal hiring freeze was the second point in President Trump’s “Contract with the American Voter.” During his inaugural address, the president said, “For too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth.” President Trump signed legislation that repealed a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act that requires companies such as Exxon Mobil or Chevron to publicly disclose the taxes and fees they pay to foreign governments. Analysis shows that the regulation costs the industry $1.3 billion. President Trump instituted a freeze on all new regulations that have not been finalized. President Trump signed a resolution that overturned the “Stream Protection Rule” issued by Obama’s Department of Interior during his last weeks in office. Trump said the resolution would “eliminate another terrible job-killing rule.” President Trump signed an executive order that would review every executive agency and department to find out, as Trump says, “where money is being wasted [and] how services can be improved.” President Trump signed legislation that repeals a Social Security Administration rule that bars Americans from their right to bear arms. Breitbart’s AWR Hawkins wrote about the rule: “Of all the regulations on the chopping block this week, the Social Security gun ban stands out as especially egregious. The Obama administration fashioned it in a way that gives the Social Security Administration the ability to bar certain beneficiaries from buying guns based on a need for help in managing their finances.” President Trump signed legislation that eliminates an onerous methane emissions rule that effectively drove energy production from federal lands. Trump signed an executive order that would review the Clean Power Plan, and possibly rescind Obama-era regulation that limits coal-fired power plants. President Trump signed legislation that repeals a Department of Labor rule that severely limits the ability of states to implement drug testing. President Trump signed legislation that repeals the Bureau of Land Management’s rule that would shift resource management from the states to the federal government. President Trump signed an executive order in February that scales back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. The executive order directs the Department of the Treasury to consult with regulatory agencies and report to the president about what could be done to eliminate what the administration considers “overreaching.” President Trump signed an executive order delaying the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule that critics contend limits consumer choice for retirement account holders.

White House chief strategist Steve Bannon detailed President Trump’s agenda in three parts: economic nationalism, national sovereignty, and deconstruction of the administrative state. At CPAC, Bannon said, “The way the progressive left runs is that if they can’t get it passed, they’re just going to put it in some sort of regulation in an agency,” he said. “That’s all going to be deconstructed.”

White House estimates show that the regulations that Trump has already repealed will save approximately $10 billion over the next ten years or $1 billion per regulation.

Trump has said that he wants to eliminate “a little more than 75 percent” of the regulations in the federal register. “We don’t need 97 different rules to take care of one element,” he said.

“We’re cutting regulations massively for small business and large business,” the president added.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b62ae7c6a:69966d:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday unexpectedly filed to run in the country’s May presidential election, contradicting a recommendation from the supreme leader to stay out of the race.

Ahmadinejad’s decision will upend an election many believed would be won by moderate President Hassan Rouhani, who negotiated the nuclear deal with world powers. Though Rouhani has yet to formally register, many viewed him as a shoe-in following Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s recommendation in September for Ahmadinejad to stand down.

But many hard-liners in Iran seek a tough-talking candidate to rally around who can stand up to U.S. President Donald Trump. Ahmadinejad’s candidacy also could expose the fissures inside Iranian politics that linger since his contested 2009 re-election, which brought massive unrest.

Associated Press journalists watched as stunned election officials processed Ahmadinejad’s paperwork on Wednesday.

Asked about Ahmadinejad’s decision, one Tehran-based analyst offered a blunt assessment.

“It was an organized mutiny against the Iran’s ruling system,” said Soroush Farhadian, who backs reformists.

Ahmadinejad previously served two four-year terms from 2005 to 2013. Under Iranian law, he became eligible to run again after four years out of office, but he remains a polarizing figure, even among fellow hard-liners.

Two of his former vice presidents have been jailed for corruption since he left office. Iran’s economy suffered under heavy international sanctions during his administration because of Western suspicions that Tehran was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

Ahmadinejad’s disputed re-election in 2009 sparked massive protests and a sweeping crackdown in which thousands of people were detained and dozens were killed.

Internationally, Ahmadinejad is more known for repeatedly questioning the scale of the Holocaust, predicting Israel’s demise and expanding Iran’s contested nuclear program.

The memory of the 2009 unrest likely sparked Khamenei’s comments in September. At that time, he recommended an unnamed candidate not seek office as it would bring about a “polarized situation” that would be “harmful for the county.”

Ahmadinejad described comments by the supreme leader suggesting he not run as “just advice” in a news conference shortly after submitting his registration. There was no immediate reaction from the supreme leader’s office.

He said his decision to run was intended to help former Vice President Hamid Baghaei, a close confidant. Baghaei registered alongside Ahmadinejad on Wednesday, as did Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, another of the former president’s close allies.

More than 120 prospective candidates submitted their names as candidates on the first day of registration Tuesday, including six women and seven clerics. Registration remains open until Saturday.

Under Iran’s electoral system, all applicants must be vetted by the Guardian Council, a clerical body that will announce a final list of candidates by April 27. The council normally does not approve dissidents or women for the formal candidate list.

The May 19 election is seen by many in Iran as a referendum on the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers and its ability to improve the country’s sanctions-hobbled economy. Under that deal, Iran agreed to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.

Since the deal, Iran has signed multi-billion-dollar contracts with airplane manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus. The benefits have yet to trickle down to the average Iranian, however, fueling some discontent.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b62811a5b:64381c:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Wall Street pension management companies are protesting a decision by agency officials to preserve a 2016 regulation which supporters say will protect retirees’ savings from self-serving sales managers.

On February 3, President Donald Trump directed officials at the Department of Labor to review the regulation “to determine whether it may adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to retirement information and financial advice.”

But officials postponed the review until late in the year and set June 9 as the start date for implementation of the regulation, which is dubbed the “diduciary duty” rule because it requires individuals who sell retirement plans to put their customers’ security above their employers’ interest in profits. In other words, salesmen and saleswomen have a “fiduciary duty” to their customers, just as a company’s CEO has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders.

The pushback by agency officials to protect the regulation shows “the ‘Swamp’ is working behind the scenes to scuttle President [Donald] Trump’s agenda,” said Patrick Hynes, president of a D.C. advocacy group, Hynes Communications, which opposes the new regulation. Hynes declined to name the business groups who fund his advocacy.

But the department’s postponement is good because it gives Trump and his populist aides another opportunity to support the rule amid opposition from greedy Wall Street investment companies, said Knut Rostad, president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard. The pro-consumer rule can be preserved “if somebody at the highest level gets the president’s ear and gives him the populist view that 95 percent of what he hears from Wall Street is total B.S.,” said Rostad.

The agency’s delay “is the only way to change the [current] dynamic, otherwise it is a done deal” that the rule will be killed in late 2017 by Wall Street’s political pressure, he added.

As required by the Administrative Procedure Act, federal officials must follow a complicated process when they are writing or replacing regulations. The new timeline set by the labor department means that the fiduciary rule regulation will operate from June until at least late in the year when the incoming Trump appointees at the department will have an opportunity to review and replace the regulation, said Rostad.

The Department of Labor oversees retirement savings plans because the savings plans are often picked by employers.

The rule has been criticized by major firms — such as Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America — but its most vigorous critics are small financial advice firms which are less able to shoulder the burden of increased regulatory costs. Some critics of the rule say it may force smaller firms to back away from providing advice on covered retirement plans. Some of the biggest Wall Street firms, such as Goldman Sachs, would hardly be touched by the role because they do not do a lot of business with the type of retirement plans covered by the new rule.

The rule is opposed by the GOP. For example, no GOP legislators supported the fiduciary rule during an April 2016 House vote.

“As someone who has spent decades in the financial services industry, I know the importance of providing all consumers—regardless of income—the opportunity to seek sound financial advice,” GOP Rep. French Hill said when the delay was announced this month. “The DOL’s Fiduciary Rule would greatly diminish access to professional retirement planning and guidance for those who need it the most. This is why a broad, bipartisan majority in Congress has called for the rule to be scrapped as written,” he said.

The fiduciary regulation is strongly supported by Democrats, partly because it was developed and pushed by President Barack Obama’s top aides and other progressives. Left-of-center consumer groups are trying to keep the rule alive, according to an article in Politico Pro.

Consumer advocacy groups on Wednesday launched a publicity campaign aimed at preserving the rule, including an event on Capitol Hill. It featured Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Stephen Wingate, a retired Vietnam veteran who is trying to recover damages through arbitration from a broker who he alleges steered him into high-fee, illiquid investments. “Had I known my broker was held to the same standard as a car salesman, I wouldn’t have trusted him so much,” Wingate said. The AARP, which claims more than 37 million members, is also defending the fiduciary rule. “We look forward to continuing to advocate for the successful implementation of this rule so that advisers can no longer legally trick retirement savers into risky or high-fee investment vehicles,” said Nancy LeaMond, the organization’s executive vice president.

But the rule also has support from some populists who want to help working-class Americans grow their retirement nest-eggs. Brendan Maher, a plaintiff’s lawyer in L.A. for example, argued that the rule helps small-dollar retirees, according to the BNA news service.

“The future of this rule is interesting, because whatever we believe about Trump, he ran on a platform of economic populism,” Maher said. “This is actually a fairly easy place for him to score some points.” Because the fiduciary rule is aimed at helping “little guy consumers” in the face of controversial financial industry practices, it presents Trump with an opportunity to curry favor with those who support his more populist tendencies, Maher said. He was quick to add that he’s “not that optimistic” this scenario will play out. “I think the future of the rule depends on the political will of the Trump administration, which is less predictable than we might expect,” Maher said.

Rostad says the rule is doomed because Wall Street has huge sway in Washington and with the GOP. Even the June date set by the agency officials won’t save the rule if the White Hosue wants it dead, he said. “The Department of Labor have set the stage for being able to come back in December and repeal the whole damn thing,” he said, adding that the Wall Street companies are being greedy in demanding the rule’s demise even before it comes into force.

Because of Wall Street’s influence, including with Trump’s economic policy director, Gary Cohn, Rostad said. “The outcome of the process is 95 percent forgone conclusion — [and] the 5 percent variable is whether somebody in the White House gets a different type of [pro-rule] command down to the Department of Labor.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b62811a5b:643817:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump dismissed Susan Rice’s assertion that she did not unmask General Michael Flynn for political reasons.

“Does anybody really believe that?” he asked during an interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. “Nobody believes that, even the people that try to protect her in the news media.”

Trump reasserted his claim, adding that he and “so many other people” were the victims of surveillance and boasted that he was correct when he accused the Obama administration of wiretapping his team at Trump Tower.

“So many people are coming up to me and apologizing now. … Perhaps I didn’t know how right I was,” he said.

To defend his claim, Trump again cited the New York Times article with the word “wiretapped” in the headline of the print edition, pointing out that it was a huge story.

“What they did was horrible,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6232bb12:5abf06:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

TEL AVIV — In its coverage of White House Spokesman Sean Spicer’s controversial comments about Adolf Hitler and Syria, the news media is widely hyping remarks by the largely unknown, hyper-partisan, anti-Trump group calling itself the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect.

The news media has been widely featuring Facebook comments by the Center’s executive director, Steven Goldstein, who demanded that Spicer be fired “at once” over his statements claiming Hitler, a genocidal leader who murdered millions of civilians, including some six million Jews in the Holocaust, “didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons,” whereas Syrian President Bashar al-Assad purportedly did deploy chemical weapons against civilians.

“I think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,” Spicer said when pressed by a reporter to clarify his remarks. Spicer said that Hitler “brought them into the Holocaust centers, I understand that.”

Spicer later clarified his remarks in a statement: “In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable.”

Spicer later took to CNN, saying, “I apologize.” He added, “It was my blunder.”

However, that didn’t stop Goldstein of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect from slamming Spicer as lacking “the integrity to serve as White House press secretary,” while demanding and that President Trump “must fire him at once.”

The Center also stated in tweets that Spicer was the “most offensive press sec ever,” and a “national embarrassment.”

.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump how does it feel to have a press secretary who engages in Holocaust denial? Fire your national embarrassment. — AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) April 11, 2017

Spicer, listen up: Anne Frank and millions of other Jews weren&apos;t killed in &quot;Holocaust Centers.&quot; Most offensive press sec ever. #FireSpicer — AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) April 12, 2017

Goldstein joined the ranks of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D, Calif.), who also quickly called on Trump to fire Spicer and “immediately disavow” the spokesman’s statements.

Goldstein’s comments about Spicer were covered widely by the news media.

“Anne Frank Center wants Spicer fired for Holocaust remarks,” was the headline of a New York Post article, using the Center’s full name in the title despite the organization’s relative obscurity.

“Anne Frank Center Demands Trump Fire Sean Spicer Over ‘Holocaust Denial’,” reads a San Francisco Chronicle headline.

Goldstein’s remarks were also prominently featured by CBS News, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and scores of other major news media outlets.

None of the articles reviewed by Breitbart News provided any background on the Center with the exception of the Washington Post, which simply informed readers that the Center is a “frequent critic of the president.”

Unreported by much of the news media is that since taking over the Anne Frank Center in June, Goldstein has used the organization that bears the name of one of the most discussed Jewish Holocaust victims as an anti-Trump political platform, as this reporter previously exposed.

When he took over the Anne Frank Center, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) profiled Goldstein as explaining that he plans to run the organization like a lean political campaign.

The JTA, a respected Jewish news agency, described the Center as a “relatively obscure Holocaust memorial organization.”

“I don’t view my work through the laid-back prism and slower cadence of a not-for-profit organization,” Goldstein said. “I’m an intense campaigner. I don’t see us as competing [with the Anti-Defamation League]. I believe deeply in partnerships.”

Indeed, Goldstein wasted no time after Trump took office, making news on January 26 for blasting the president’s executive order to temporary halt the refugee program as using “national security as a guise for racism.”

In February, Goldstein made headlines for claiming the Trump administration evidenced “the worst we have ever seen” as far as “the anti-Semitism coming out of this administration.” He claimed that Trump’s condemnation of anti-Semitism that month was “too little, too late.”

“Our president is creating an incubator of hatred,” he claimed. “When you don’t respond to anti-Semitism as well as Islamophobia and racism in real time, when you wait days and sometimes a week to respond to attacks, you are sending a signal to the haters.”

In February, Jewish organizations nationwide were hit with waves of bomb threats. It would later emerge that many of those threats were called in by an Israeli-American teenager who was arrested in Israel last month.

Goldstein’s remarks about anti-Semitism and Trump were also widely reported by the news media at the time. “Anne Frank Center slams Trump: ‘Do not make us Jews settle for crumbs of condescension,’” was the title of a Washington Post article in one of many examples of such coverage.

Goldstein last week was also quoted in the news media to smear Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a deputy foreign policy adviser to Trump, as being linked to the neo-Nazi far-right.

The Anne Frank Center’s twitter account, which Salon.com reported is manned by Goldstein, has been utilized to unleash repeated attacks on Trump.

In one of many strangely worded tweets, the Center called Trump’s policies “evil.” Another branded Trump a narcissist.

Here is a small sampling of a few other recent anti-Trump tweets:

Some of the Center’s tweets opposed Trump’s plan to build a barrier along the porous U.S.-Mexico border:

DON&apos;T BAN REFUGEES OR WALL OUT IMMIGRANTS. #RefugeesWelcome #ImmigrantsWelcome#NoBanNoWallNoRaids — AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) February 15, 2017

One tweet utilized the memory of Anne Frank to call her a Syrian refugee.

Writing at the Daily Caller in February, columnist and Jewish historian David Benkof charged that “Goldstein is not a Holocaust expert, and the Anne Frank Center (a separate group independent of Amsterdam’s Anne Frank House) is not a serious player in the world of Holocaust memory.”

Benkof said of the Center under Goldstein’s leadership:

Of late, it has become a sham organization that is largely a one-man shop to promote Goldstein’s aspirations to be, as he proclaims himself, a “civil rights leader.” Armed with a great organizational title; incendiary but ready-to-print quotes; and a gullible media slavishly lapping it all up, Goldstein is finding tremendous success. (He could not be reached for comment.)

The JTA reported that Goldstein backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign:

Goldstein backs presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In April, he wrote on Facebook that “sometimes you compromise to forge consensus, but sometimes you don’t to stand your ground. Knowing when to do which is the art of the revolution. That’s Hillary Clinton’s gift.”

Prior to taking over the Center, Goldstein was an LGBT rights activist who reportedly called himself “the Harvey Milk of New Jersey,” referring to the famed American politician and gay civil rights activist.

Goldstein founded a group called Garden State Equality, which campaigned for gay rights laws in New Jersey and was involved in activism that led to the state in 2013 allowing same-sex marriage. His campaigns were portrayed in the 2015 movie Freeheld, in which he was portrayed by actor Steve Carell. The movie was based on a 2007 documentary of the same name.

Republican Ron Estes won Tuesday’s special election in the Fourth Congressional District of Kansas to replace the district’s former representative, Mike Pompeo, who was named earlier this year by President Trump to serve as Director of the CIA, the Associated Press reported late Tuesday.

“The Associated Press says Republican Ron Estes has won the special House election to replace Mike Pompeo. He has 52 percent of the vote to Democrat James Thompson’s 47 percent with 519 of 620 precincts counted,” the Wichita Eagle reported at 9:43 pm central time.

Democrats were hoping to score an anti-Trump victory in the district Pompeo won in November with 60 percent of the vote. Though their candidate came up short on Tuesday night, local Democrats took some solace in the much narrower margin of victory for the Republicans in this special election.

Some Republicans were not happy with the level of effort the Republican House leadership put in during the campaign.

As Breitbart News reported earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan spent the week on vacation at Universal Studios in Hollywood. It was left to a conservative Republican member of the Senate, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), to campaign on behalf of Estes in the district on the day before the campaign.

Still, Speaker Ryan expressed his congratulations to Estes on his victory.

“I’m glad to welcome Ron Estes to the 115th Congress and I look forward to working with him to solve the challenges facing our country,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement released Tuesday evening. Ryan concluded in his statement:

Ron has been deeply involved in his community for years and I’m confident he will be a strong voice for Kansas’ 4th Congressional District in Washington, D.C. Whether in the manufacturing industry or in public office, Ron has always worked to improve efficiency and find savings. Kansans are fortunate to have this committed public servant representing them in Congress and I’d like to offer my full congratulations to Ron and his entire family on his victory.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also released a statement on Estes’s victory in the special election.

“I want to congratulate Ron Estes on his victory,” she said in the statement.

“President Trump called on Kansans to send Ron Estes to Washington to help Republicans cut taxes and fix healthcare and tonight that’s exactly what they did. While Democrats are desperate to recover from their losses in November, Kansas voters reaffirmed that Republicans, under the leadership of President Trump, remain best equipped to solve the needs of Americans across the country,” McDaniel added.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b61b05630:47bf9c:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The political situation in Venezuela has destabilized significantly as the socialist dictatorship has attempted to nullify the opposition-held legislature and banned a presidential contender from public office for fifteen years. It is a bizarre time for dictator Nicolás Maduro to leave the country, yet he has done so, attending a leftist summit in Havana.

Maduro delivered a speech in Havana Tuesday at the summit of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), a joint Cuban-Venezuelan effort to unite leftist leaders in Latin America. Maduro spoke for over an hour, attacking Washington and accusing the administration of President Donald Trump of conspiring to force a “coup” against him.

“The true truth is that there has been an order from Washington of zero dialogue in Venezuela to make our country explode and allow a foreign invasion,” Maduro told the Cuban audience, claiming Trump is seeking a “coup d’etat” in Venezuela.

Of Trump personally, Maduro said that his administration was “very dangerous, very threatening,” which represented a more respectful approach than his description of Organization of American States (OAS) head Luis Almagro as “garbage of garbage,” “filth,” and “traitor of traitors.”

Despite this, Maduro’s attack on Trump was a change in attitude from Maduro’s previous, inscrutable message to Trump, which appeared to be an attempt to warn the bilateral relationship.

Maduro, a longtime ally of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, may have chosen to go on the offensive against Trump following the White House’s announcement that the president had ordered airstrikes against the Syrian regime as punishment for the use of chemical weapons.

Maduro also took to the time to accuse Europe of spreading slavery worldwide: “Over 50 million men and women were abducted from Africa and brought here, worse than animals, tied up, turned into slaves throughout this continent, as we say, by the cultured Europe; it was the cultured Europe who imposed slavery, racism, exclusion, and plunder of entire continents.”

The ALBA, run by Cuba and Venezuela, issued a statement condemning human rights advocates and international institutions like the OAS for calling for an end to violence and political repression in Venezuela. “We reject the aggressions and concerted manipulations against our ally,” the group said in a statement. “We condemn the interventionist, illegal and pro-imperialist behavior of the OAS secretary general.”

Tensions have escalated in the South American nation following an attempt by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court to invalidate the legislature and install itself as the federal lawmaking body two weeks ago.

Last week, the socialist government banned Henrique Capriles Radonski, a former opposition presidential candidate and governor of Miranda state, from holding public office for fifteen years, with little explanation. Capriles condemned the decision, arguing, “the first option to be president of Venezuela is Leopoldo [López] who is in prison, and me, now banned from running for office.” Opposition leader López is serving a fourteen-year prison sentence for organizing a peaceful protest.

The protests in response to these moves have become violent, with two young student protesters – 21-year-old Daniel Queliz and 19-year-old Jairo Ortiz – killed in the past week and an 87-year-old woman dying after her home was filled with tear gas, used against protesters. Police used helicopters and officers stationed on rooftops to shoot tear gas and rubber bullets at unarmed protesters in Caracas, injuring an estimated 200, according to opposition legislators.

The Venezuelan government has called upon the international community to condemn the protesters.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b60ccf28d:337c1f:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. — After almost two months of a federal government hiring freeze, Trump administration officials have released guidance on the President’s plan to “drain the swamp,” with what Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney described as the first-ever rebuilding of the federal government.

An April 12 memorandum provides guidance to federal agencies tasked with complying with the Reorganization Executive Order entitled “Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch” as the January 23, 2017 hiring freeze is lifted.

Agencies are instructed to take “immediate actions to achieve near-term workforce reductions and cost savings, including planning for funding levels in the President’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 Budget Blueprint, develop a plan to maximize employee performance by June 30, 2017, and submit an Agency Reform Plan to OMB in September 2017 as part of the agency’s FY 2019 Budget submission to OMB that includes long-term workforce reductions. An initial, high-level draft of the Agency Reform Plan is due to OMB by June 30, 2017.”

The memorandum outlines “the steps that OMB will take to formulate a comprehensive Government-wide Reform Plan for publication in the President’s FY 2019 Budget … this plan will rely on three primary sources of input: Agency Reform Plans, OMB-coordinated crosscutting proposals, and public input.”

The reform efforts are purported to, among other things, “create a lean, accountable, more efficient government that works for the American people.”

The government hiring freeze that President Trump instituted on January 23, 2017 ends with release of the new guidance memo, Mulvaney said on Tuesday. “This does not mean that the agencies will be free to hire willy nilly,” he added. Mulvaney stated that the guidance simply replaces the “across the board hiring freeze” with “a more surgical plan.”

As the Trump Admin FY 2018 Budget Blueprint shows, some agencies were appropriated more federal funds, while others received fewer — so some will correspondingly be granted an increase in hiring allowance while others will “end up paring their FTEs even greater than they would have had during the hiring freeze.”

Mulvaney called the government reorganization, “one of the biggest stories nobody’s talking about.” He defined the plan as doing something that goes “much deeper into the very structure of government … trying to do something that has never been done before.”

He continued:

The executive branch of government has never been rebuilt. It has grown organically over the course of the last 240 years and the President of the United States has asked all of us in the Executive Branch to start from scratch, a literal blank piece of paper, and say if you were going to rebuild the Executive Branch, what would it look like?

Information has been solicited from both within and outside the federal government, Mulvaney said. He added that CEOs gathered at the White House on Tuesday have also offered input on how the government should be restructured.

The memo instructs all agencies to consult with OMB to identify and begin taking actions to develop a plan to maximize employee performance and an Agency Reform Plan.

Agencies are required to provide a preliminary plan by June 30, 2017. In July, OMB will meet with Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies and a limited number of others to discuss items for the purpose of gathering feedback and incorporating that feedback into draft Agency Reform Plans, according to the memorandum. Those plans are due in September 2017. Implementation of some agreed upon reforms may begin following the July meetings, while reforms continue to be assessed.

Mulvaney conceded that some reform will require the legislative authority.

“Net, we think we could run the government more efficiently than the previous administration can and we think we can run the government with fewer people than the previous administration,” said Mulvaney.

The Director continued, “What kicks in tomorrow is what we call the smart hiring plan.” He said as soon as the guidance goes out, the Administration expects that agencies will review what they interpret to be the President’s priorities, look to the budget blueprint, and “fashion” hiring or paring down of their respective agencies’ workforces.

Asked where expansion and cuts were expected in hiring, Mulvaney directed eyes to look to the President’s Budget Blueprint.

“This is about good government. Okay? It’s not about big government, it’s not about small government, it’s about good government. And that is what I think the President talks about when he talks about draining the swamp,” said Mulvaney. “If you’re on the left, the right, the middle, they don’t know where they are philosophically, they know that Washington doesn’t function well.”

Mulvaney stated that what the “businessman-in-chief” has essentially come to say is, “Make sure this government functions properly. That means it’s going to be more efficient, more accountable, more effective, and providing the services that we need.”

Mulvaney said that this guidance lays out what the President talked about when he referred to draining “the swamp” in Washington, D.C.

Former Bush and Reagan operative Elliott Abrams told a Politico correspondent on Monday that President Donald Trump should fire top strategist Steve Bannon.

“He’s not a good influence on the president,” Abrams said, adding that having a “political strategist” among those with a permanent seat on the National Security Council was “a terrible mistake.”

Abrams was being considered to be Deputy Secretary of State under Rex Tillerson but was not chosen — something Abrams first blamed on President Donald Trump’s “thin skin” after the president learned details about Abrams’ criticism of him during the campaign, CNN reported in early February.

“The President found out about Abrams’ outspokenness against Trump after meeting with him on Tuesday to consider him for the position, which would have made him Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s deputy,” CNN reported.”The meeting went well, but Trump could not get past Abrams’ past criticism, the sources said.”

“Another Republican source with knowledge of what happened said Abrams would not get the job because of ‘Donald Trump’s thin skin and nothing else,’” CNN reported.

In May of 2016, Abrams wrote in the Weekly Standard:

Republicans who oppose Trump need to keep making the arguments that candidates like Rubio and Cruz and Bush made this year unsuccessfully. It didn’t work this time but it can work next time, when voters see Trump collapse—and when they see an increasingly dangerous world and a Clinton administration wedded to a bloated federal government as the solution to every problem. Next time, in 2020, we’ll have had 12 years of Obama and Clinton, Hillary will be in her mid-seventies, Trump will be gone, and a new generation of Republican leaders like Rubio and Cruz and Ryan and Cotton and Haley and Sasse will still be in their forties.

But just days after the CNN report, Abrams blamed Bannon for his lost opportunity.

“The only person on the White House staff that I know was opposed to my being hired was Steve Bannon, so that’s my guess,” Abrams told CNN’s Erin Burnett in a Feb. 14 interview. “It’s a guess.”

But Abrams had other critics. In a Breitbart News exclusive also published in February, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said he would oppose Abrams’ nomination to the State Department post.

“In a country of 300 million people, surely there are reasonable foreign policy experts who have not been convicted of deceiving Congress and actually share the President’s foreign policy views,” Paul wrote in an excerpt of the op-ed that was published in Rare and obtained by Breitbart News ahead of its release.

“Tillerson tried to convince Trump to make Abrams his deputy despite the criticism because he felt he needed his foreign policy experience, according to multiple sources,” CNN reported back in February. “White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Jared Kushner also strongly supported Abrams and urged Trump to reconsider, the sources said.”

In Monday’s Politico piece the correspondent refers to the “West Wing ideological war” and Abram’s “delight” that some in the White House are “picking sides against Bannon.”

“Having served in the George W. Bush administration and under Ronald Reagan before that, Abrams probably would have been waging those internal battles himself had Trump not overruled Tillerson at Bannon’s behest,” Politico reported.

Bannon has said his stepping away from the permanent seat on the NSC was planned to take place when his work on the council was complete.

“Susan Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration,” Bannon said in a statement. “I was put on to ensure that it was de-operationalized.”

“General [H.R.] McMaster has returned the NSC to its proper function,” Bannon said, referring to Trump’s National Security Adviser.

“As for his own future with Trump, Abrams teased that it may still be in front of him, depending on how things shape up with Bannon and Kushner, the latter of whom he kept going out of his way to praise,” Politico reported.

The Politico correspondent also added some color to his description of Abrams when he spoke about Bannon.

“A giant smile spreads across his face at the thought of Bannon being forced out of the White House completely,” the Politico correspondent wrote.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b605e3ed7:2a5c1a:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The federal government will test 20 different prototype border walls near San Diego this summer, according to a Tuesday report in the San Diego Union-Tribune.

The test walls will be built in the Otay Mesa community alongside the existing border walls, once the most promising proposals are selected in June, according to the newspaper.

Federal officials told the Associated Press that the prototype walls would be 30 feet high and 30 feet long, and will each cost between $200,000 to $500,000.

Democrats in the Senate are blocking President Donald Trump’s border-wall funding request for $1 billion dollars by April 28. Top GOP leaders are not fighting the Democrats’ obstruction, but are promising to fund construction of the border wall from October onwards.

DHS spokesman David Lapan said Tuesday that the agency is funding the test walls by transferring funds from other parts of the agency. The agency has permission from budget leaders in Congress to “reprogram” the existing funds, he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6057a4c6:276567:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) tells Breitbart News exclusively that he expects House Republicans will unite around common principles and pass an Obamacare repeal and replace bill that lowers premiums for Americans soon—delivering President Donald Trump a major victory in the Congress’s lower chamber.

Meadows, a pro-Trump conservative leader in the House who stuck with the president throughout the entire campaign, is confident that renewed negotiations—with the help of senior White House officials—with House GOP leaders and House Republican moderates is likely to produce real results in the House.

Meadows told Breitbart News on Tuesday afternoon:

I’m optimistic that we’ve at least found some potential common ground. Conservative requests and those from those that represent districts that may have a more moderate constituency don’t want to suggest anything other than the discussions have been extremely good over the last 72 hours and the pre-existing conditions that must be addressed on behalf of the president and certainly most members of our GOP conference including myself, that issue is where we’re working very diligently to make sure we cover it in the legislation but then we also cover it in a number of ways whether it be through a risk-sharing pool or through a guaranteed issue provision that’s out there. So, we still believe providing waivers at the state level from many of the Obamacare mandates that drive up costs might be a real path forward so I would say that conversations between moderates and conservatives are very constructive and it’s been due in no small part to the active involvement of the White House and leadership in trying to make sure we get a good bill—a better bill—going forward over to the Senate.

Meadows’ comments come a few weeks after the first such bill—the American Health Care Act (AHCA) from House Speaker Paul Ryan—failed to garner enough support, with moderates and Freedom Caucus members lining up against the Ryan bill. Moderates like Tuesday group co-chairman Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA), Appropriations chairman Rep. Rodney Frelinguysen (R-NJ); Reps. Barbara Comstock (R-VA), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Frank LoBiondo (R-NJ), Mark Amodei (R-NV), and many more joined many Freedom Caucus members in opposition to the Ryan bill.

The Ryan bill also faced fierce opposition in the Senate, where Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Lee (R-UT), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Susan Collins (R-ME), Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and more raised concerns with the bill. Conservative leaders dubbed Ryan’s bill “RyanCare,” “RINO-Care,” “Obamacare Lite” or “Obamacare 2.0,” among other derogatory names, as it failed to deliver.

Paul, in an interview with Breitbart News, detailed how Ryan was misleading President Trump on the level of support the bill actually had, as the bill was doomed to fail from the beginning—and media such as Breitbart News were reporting on its grim prospects for weeks in advance of an eventually twice-called-off-before-failure vote on the House floor. When the bill was pulled once and for all, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that maybe it was for the best—and that he expected a better bill.

Meadows’ deputy chief of staff Wayne King, one of the key conservative House staffers leading the way in helping implement Trump’s agenda in the House, told Breitbart News that Meadows is aiming to help President Trump at every turn.

“Chairman Meadows remains committed to implementing President Trump’s agenda to Make America Great Again, and that includes repealing and replacing Obamacare with a better healthcare system with lower premiums, more competition and stronger consumer choices,” King told Breitbart News. “As the White House works to undo the damage caused by the previous president on healthcare and so many other issues, we stand firm with President Trump committed to a more prosperous America.”

Meadows predicted that the renewed negotiations—which were first reported by USA Today’s Eliza Collins, reporting on Tuesday from Meadows’ North Carolina district—would be successful in passing the House and getting a better bill, as Trump promised. Meadows said:

I can tell you the president has communicated to me on more than four different occasions that he wants the very best bill possible for the American people and that he believes that not only will we get a better bill but with everyone’s input—not just conservative members, but conservatives, moderates and those that are in between—that we’ll get a better bill and we’ll shock the American people when they actually see their healthcare insurance premiums come down. I’m confident we’re going to get there mainly because the president literally not only wants to repeal and replace Obamacare, but the other part of that is he wants to drive down premiums for all Americans.

Meadows added, too, that the Trump White House has been instrumental in delivering this part of the agenda for the president and leading in helping with the negotiations. He said:

The involvement from the White House in particular on getting an agreement has been nothing short of just remarkable. To have the day-to-day interaction on behalf of the White House on delivering on campaign promises would touch on even the greatest skeptic that would dare to mention that Washington, D.C., is the same as it always has been. He’s delivering on it, and we’re glad to have played a very small part in helping him to deliver on that campaign promise.

Meadows also said that he expects by the 200-day mark that President Trump—with Republicans conference-wide, especially the House Freedom Caucus, at his side—will be able to hammer home more than 20 campaign promises delivered:

We’re committed to not only helping him deliver that [healthcare reform] but also helping him make sure that campaign promise is one of the first dozen or so that he’s been able to deliver on. I’m hopeful that by the end of his first 200 days in office, he’ll have more than 20 campaign promises that he will have delivered on. He’s on a good pace and clip to do just that.

The USA Today report noted that Meadows is in “frequent conversation” with Ryan, Vice President Mike Pence, and House Tuesday Group co-chairman Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ) in recent days, and that if the plan reaches “consensus” soon, “the House may come back from recess to vote.” That would be a remarkable development, as the House is scheduled to be on recess for the next couple of weeks—and any return from recess to deliver Trump this win would go a long way.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b6050e998:26d57b:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">. @POTUS : &quot;We are going to have a phenomenal tax reform but I have to do health care first.&quot; https://t.co/qkETJHyeB8 pic.twitter.com/PWfyDwrGPN

In an interview with Fox Business Network, President Donald Trump pledged “phenomenal tax reform,” but added he had “to do health care first.”

He continued, “We are saving tremendous amounts of money on health care when we get this done number one. And most importantly, actually, we are going to have great healthcare and all of that saving goes into the tax. If you don’t do that you can’t put any of the savings into the tax cuts and the tax reform.”

He added, “I don’t want to put deadlines. Health care is going to happen, at some point. Now, if does not happen fast enough I’ll start the taxes. But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do health care first.”

Amid rising concern over tensions with Russia and Iran following a series of U.S. airstrikes against the Assad regime, Donald Trump has confirmed that the United States will not be conducting a full-scale invasion of Syria.

In an interview with The New York Post, Trump said, “Our policy is the same, it hasn’t changed. We’re not going into Syria.”

However, Trump described Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad as a “butcher” and a “barbarian,” after allegations that he used chemical sarin gas to slaughter his own people.

“Our big mission is getting rid of ISIS,” he said. “That’s where it’s always been. But when you see kids choking to death, you watch their lungs burning out, we had to hit him and hit him hard.”

Last Thursday, Trump ordered a series of missile strikes against Syrian regime airbases in response to the chemical attack, which a Pentagon spokesperson said were “intended to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again.”

Asked about his decision to personally order the airstrikes, Trump said that it had been “very tough to give that final go ahead when you know you’re talking about human life.”

“We went back and forth and also back and forth about severity. We could have gone bigger in terms of targets and more of them, but we thought this would be the appropriate first shot,” he continued.

The comments are likely to ease tensions across the international community, after Russia and Iran released a joint statement warning the U.S. that they will “respond with force” if they believe their own “red lines” are crossed in Syria.

A Gallup poll released on Tuesday revealed that public support for the airstrikes is comparatively low against previous wars such as the invasion of Iraq. However, Americans overwhelmingly approve of military action in Iraq and Syria with the aim of defeating the Islamic State.

This week, Russian officials confirmed that Vladimir Putin will not be meeting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he visits Moscow later this week, despite Putin awarding Tillerson a Russian Order of Friendship award in 2013.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) “rallied Monday afternoon with about 200 [Ron] Estes supporters in a hangar stop near Eisenhower National Airport, the last major campaign event leading up to Tuesday’s election,” the Wichita Eagle reported in the closely watched battle to replace CIA Director Mike Pompeo in the Fourth Congressional District of Kansas.

Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), in contrast, is reportedly vacationing at Universal Studios in Hollywood.

“Our enemy right now is complacency,” Cruz told the crowd of Estes supporters, as the Eagle reported:

Estes, the Republican state treasurer, is locked in a hard-fought battle with Democratic civil rights attorney James Thompson for the seat vacated by former Rep. Mike Pompeo. Libertarian Chris Rockhold, a flight instructor, is also in the race. Cruz said Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election was an “overwhelming cry from the American people to change the path we’re on.” “That’s the mandate we’ve been given with a Republican president and both houses of Congress,” Cruz said.

“Cruz’s visit was part of a full-court press by the national GOP to boost Estes’ campaign in the final days,” the Eagle noted.

The New York Times reported that the Kansas special election results could be a possible warning sign for the Republican Party.

Former Rep. Tim Huelskamp was critical of the priorities of the Republican House leadership in a tweet earlier this week, suggesting they were not doing enough to secure a special election victory in the Fourth Congressional District.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a press conference on Tuesday that Hitler did not use chemical weapons during WWII, arguing that Russia would be on the wrong side of history in supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This sparked a clamor online of people quick to point out the existence of the gas chambers used to murder millions in concentration camps.

Later in the presser, Spicer clarified his comments:

When it comes to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing… In the way that Assad used them where he went into towns and dropped him down on innocents in the middle of town was not the same. I appreciate the clarification, that was not the intent.

While Spicer’s comments were deserving of criticism, members of the media, celebrities, and even Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY) went into hysterics, accusing Spicer of denying the Holocaust on social media:

&quot;Hitler didn’t even sink to the level of using chemical weapons.&quot;

On Tuesday, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) wrote an email to The Hill, pushing back against criticism of her criticism of President Donald Trump’s missile strike in Syria.

The Hill chopped the headline down to “We Need to Learn From Iraq,” even though what Gabbard actually said was, “We need to learn from Iraq and Libya,” questioning not only President George W. Bush’s policy in Iraq but the Obama administration’s intervention in Syria.

The main thrust of Gabbard’s email to The Hill is an argument against military intervention. She evidently used the email to lay it out in a clean and simple fashion.

“We need to learn from Iraq and Libya – wars that were propagated as necessary to relieve human suffering, but actually increased human suffering many times over,” she wrote.

“I and thousands of my brothers- and sisters-in-arms went to war in Iraq based on false intelligence and lies from our leaders – our president, military, and political leaders. We should have been skeptical then, and we weren’t,” argued Gabbard, an officer in the Hawaiian Army National Guard who served two tours of duty in Iraq.

She also criticized President Trump for failing to seek congressional approval before ordering the missile attack on Syria.

“There is a reason our Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war: we should be shown the evidence and given the opportunity to debate the strategy and sacrifice expected. No leader – of either party, pro or against military intervention – should let our President take us down the path to another regime change war without that debate,” she urged.

Gabbard previously denounced Trump’s “escalation” of U.S. involvement in Syria as “short-sighted,” warning that it would lead to “more dead civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and a possible nuclear war between the United States and Russia.”

She has also promised to call for Assad’s “prosecution and execution by the International Criminal Court” if he can be proven guilty of using chemical weapons against his own civilians, although she added that the U.S. attack on Sharyat airbase might have made a conclusive investigation impossible.

The Hill chose not to reprint Gabbard’s email in its entirety, so it is not clear if she acknowledges that some of the pushback she is pushing back against is directed at her indulgence of conspiracy theories that exonerate Syrian President Bashar Assad of responsibility for the chemical weapons deployment in Idlib province last week.

She has also been criticized for visiting Syria and meeting with Assad. “Whatever you think about President Assad, the fact is that he is the president of Syria. In order for any peace agreement, in order for any possibility of a viable peace agreement to occur, there has to be a conversation with him,” she said in defense of her actions.

Gabbard said her visits to Syria were motivated by her extreme commitment to end “this war that has caused so much suffering to the Syrian people, to these children, to these families, many of whom I met on this trip.”

That does not bypass the many controversies swirling around her trip, as capably summarized by the Lawfare blog:

She reportedly declined to inform House leadership in advance, met with Bashar al-Assad, toured with officials from a Lebanese political party that actively supports Assad, and received funding from an American organization that counts one of those same officials as its executive director. Moreover, both before and after traveling to Syria, the congresswoman channeled some of Assad’s positions on the war in statements to the public.

One other controversy, naturally the principal one examined by Lawfare, is that Gabbard’s renegade diplomacy with Assad would seem like a fairly blatant violation of the Logan Act – that strangely-worded, dubiously constitutional, never-enforced 1799 law which is supposed to criminalize freelance diplomacy. However moribund the Logan Act might seem, Gabbard should understand that Americans want their government to present a somewhat unified front on the world stage.

Gabbard’s point about the need for congressional authorization has been made, or at least tacitly acknowledged, by other politicians of both parties. Both Democrat and Republican lawmakers criticized President Obama for bypassing Congress when he launched his Libyan intervention, a much larger and more expensive project than anything the Trump administration has currently put on the table for Syria.

On the other hand, skeptics say that most congressional representatives are quietly content with various presidential administrations bypassing their warmaking authority, and thus relieving them of responsibility for difficult and politically inconvenient votes, such as the congressional vote to authorize the Iraq War. As The Hill observes in its post about Gabbard’s email, congressional enthusiasm for insisting upon involvement in further military decisions related to Syria is mixed.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5f7fb964:171f41:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Speaking of the United States’ bid to co-host the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati noted that President Donald Trump is “fully supportive” of the effort.

The comment comes after the soccer federations of the United States, Mexico, and Canada announced a joint bid to host the upcoming World Cup, USA Today reported.

During Monday’s joint press conference, Gulati addressed the question of how the Mexican soccer officials could work with their U.S. counterparts after last year’s contentious election.

“We have the full support of the United States government in this project,” Gulati said during the presser.

“The president of the United States is fully supportive and encouraged us in having this joint bid. He is especially pleased that Mexico is part of this bid, and that’s in the last few days that we have gotten further encouragement on that,” the U.S. soccer chief continued.

“We’re not at all concerned about some of the issues that other people may raise,” Gulati added. “We looked at bidding alone, and again, decided we wanted to bid with our partners in North America, and we have a strong encouragement from President Trump to that very end.”

For his part, Decio de María, president of the Federación Mexicana de Fútbol and CONCACAF vice president, agreed that the World Cup is about soccer, not politics.

“I believe, like Sunil said, this is not a forum to talk about politics, it’s a forum to talk about soccer,” de María said. “What I am certain of is that both countries will work tirelessly to build many soccer fields, so that the ball keeps rolling and so that our respective communities can enjoy the benefits that soccer creates.”

Certainly the issue of immigration featured prominently in Trump’s campaign and subsequent election to the White House. But, the three soccer heads assured the media that the issue would not be part of the World Cup.

“That us three are standing here as presidents of the federations of the countries that took in our families is a very strong statement,” Victor Montagliani, president of the Canadian Soccer Association and president of CONCACAF, said during the conference. “And it’s something that I’m very proud of.”

Speaking in Spanish, de María added that, “the real winners are soccer and the region to have invited the world to enjoy this celebration. I think that’s how you create a beautiful story.”

The vote on where the 2026 World Cup will end up occurs in 2020, as President Trump’s current term in office winds down, though the game itself would be held during another president’s term, regardless.

According to the plan worked out between the three countries, the U.S. would get 60 of the 80 games and Mexico and Canada would host ten each.

As Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives in Moscow for talks with the Russian government – no longer scheduled to meet President Vladimir Putin himself – international observers have expressed growing concern of a showdown between two of the world’s major political powers.

Those who criticize President Donald Trump for ordering airstrikes against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, a longtime ally of Russia’s, warn that a prolonged war in the Middle East is not in America’s best interests. Even more concerning, many contend, is a prolonged war in the Middle East with the potential of direct conflict with Russia.

Trump now finds himself in the bizarre position of an overnight mainstream media about-face. Those who warn Trump’s relationship with Russia is too contentious, on many prior occasions participated in the chorus of invective accusing Trump of being too close to Russia, of indulging a “bromance” and “love story” with Putin. At one point during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Democratic campaign platform almost exclusively became a warning that a President Trump would allow the nefarious Putin to take over the world. Soundly defeated, the Democrats alleged that Putin had “hacked” the election on Trump’s behalf.

Neither critics nor supporters of Trump’s decision to confront Russia can adequately predict what Russia will do to save face following last week’s humiliation, because Putin himself has never faced such a challenge since becoming Prime Minister in 1999. Neither presidents George W. Bush nor Barack Obama responded to Putin’s belligerence on the world stage with decisive action. On the contrary, both attempted to establish friendly personal relations, treating Putin as a democratic leader with no ambition beyond his borders.

Trump’s foreign policy, despite months of mainstream media coverage arguing the contrary, is to treat Putin’s Russia as a rogue state until it proves otherwise by eschewing Assad. How Putin will respond to such austere American action is anyone’s guess – not because Putin is an unpredictable political figure, but because no American president before Trump had tested just how predictable he would be under pressure.

Both Bush and Obama have attempted to rewrite their histories with Putin. During a recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Bush claimed to have a “contentious relationship” with Putin. He warned that Putin would “push and push and push until someone stands up to him.”

During the Bush era, Putin indeed pushed and pushed, with the American president responding with timid diplomacy. The relationship began on a high note mocked the world over: a 2001 meeting in which Bush declared that he had “looked the man [Putin] in the eye… [and] was able to get a sense of his soul.”

“I found him to be very straight-forward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue,” Bush said of his first meeting with Putin.

By 2007, towards the end of Putin’s first term as President, Reuters reported that “the situation got so bad last month that Putin seemed to compare U.S. foreign policy to that of the Third Reich,” outraged at American action to protect allies in Eastern Europe. Bush responded to Putin’s belligerence by inviting him for “lobster rolls and handshakes” at the Bush family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine. The elder Bush, former president George H.W. Bush, approved of his son’s strategy, telling a local television station in Maine, “fishing is good for the soul.”

A year later, Russia invaded Georgia. Claiming that Georgian troops had initiated a military operation against ethnic Russians in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Putin committed to helping the separatist cause there. President Bush referred to the initiative as a “dangerous escalation” and expressed his displeasure with Dmitry Medvedev, now president as Putin once again assumed the Prime Minister role.

Aside from that phone call, however, the American president appeared more preoccupied with his role as “fan-in-chief” at the Beijing Olympics than confronting Russia in Georgia, a country so pro-American it boasts a statue of Ronald Reagan in its capital.

Putin himself, while no longer president, blamed Bush for the war Russia had started in Georgia, claiming Bush had ordered military activity to benefit Sen. John McCain’s presidential run. If this accusation sounds familiar, it is because Putin made a very similar claim today, calling an alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians by the Assad regime a “false flag” operation meant to benefit the Trump administration.

With a career so devoid of bonafide, high-stakes challenges from America, Putin boasts a thin playbook.

Thanks almost exclusively to an ambitious PR war in the west by then-president Mikheil Saakashvili, tensions simmered in Georgia. South Ossetia remains occupied by Russia, however, and Russian parliamentarians have openly expressed a will to annex it.

The Obama era, astoundingly, proved even more beneficial to the Russian regime. Putin assumed the presidency again in 2012 as Obama began his second term.

The Obama administration began their diplomatic relationship with Russia – the famous “Russia reset” – on a sour note. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s notorious sense of humor baffled her Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, as she handed him a button with the word “overcharged” on it in Russian (the button should have read “reset.” Get it?).

In their early encounters, President Obama publicly praised Putin’s “extraordinary work… on behalf of the Russian people.” In private, he reportedly tolerated Putin’s hours-long diatribe about the greatness of Russia.

Speaking to Medvedev, Obama was even more deferent as both the Russian and American president’s first terms wound to a close. “This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility,” Obama told Medvedev in South Korea, a message caught on a hot pic.

“I will transmit this information to Vladimir,” Medvedev responded.

Not much time elapsed after this conversation before Putin invaded Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea, and pro-Russian rebels used Russian weapons to shoot a commercial aircraft out of the sky.

The Obama administration “condemned” the annexation of Crimea and involved the Russian government in the probe into the downing of MH-17, thereby ensuring the Russians would be in charge of investigating pro-Russian rebels.

As the White House failed to assert itself in eastern Europe, Russian officials were expanding their influence deep into Syria. Medvedev and Putin appeared to take Obama’s 2012 “red line” remarks – threatening U.S. action against the Assad regime should it use chemical weapons against civilians – as an opportunity to usurp American influence in the region.

On the anniversary of the “red line” speech, Assad’s troops killed over 200 people in a chemical weapons attack with impunity. Secretary of State John Kerry offered Assad the opportunity to evade consequences by giving up his chemical weapons arsenal shortly thereafter, a move one U.S. official referred to as a “major goof.”

Putin, once again president, eagerly called Kerry’s bluff, and shortly thereafter Russia vouched for Assad, claiming Damascus had given up all its chemical weapons.

“We struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out,” Kerry boasted at the time. “I get a call from Lavrov an hour and a half later saying, ‘That’s a great idea. We should be pursuing that. Why don’t we sit down and talk and see if we can get that done?’ And within days, we got it done.”

History proved this claim untrue last week, when Assad forces reportedly used chemical weapons once again.

By then, Russia had become heavily involved in Syria, though Russian forces only began executing bombing runs in 2015, the day after Putin discussed Syria with Obama in an in-person meeting. A month later, Putin was joking that the Obama administration had “mush for brains.” Another month, and international NGOs were calling the use of chemical weapons in Syria “routine.”

The Obama administration continued to claim the “red line” on chemical weapons use was still viable. If true today, the world has the Trump administration to thank for it.

Since Trump’s airstrikes on an Assad base in Syria, the Kremlin has warned of an increased risk of confrontation with American troops in the region and threatened to shut down a “deconfliction line” the two countries keep to avoid attacking each other in Syria (the Pentagon has neither confirmed nor denied that the line no longer exists). Putin may respond with further actions to punish the Trump administration and maintain control of the Syrian Civil War; he may, in response to his first major challenge from Washington, abandon the Assad regime and refocus his efforts in the region towards other war zones like Libya and Afghanistan. What is certain is that Trump has brought Putin to a fork in the road he has never before encountered, and a chance to define himself as either statesman or madman.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5ed6716f:7f518:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced tougher prosecutorial standards for people caught crossing the border illegally during a tour in southern Arizona Tuesday. He emphasized prosecuting cartel and gang connected drug and human smugglers as well as repeat crossers.

“The catch and release practices of old are over,” Sessions told a group of U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel gathered in Nogales, Arizona. He assured these people tasked with enforcing the borders of the United States that the Department of Justice will have their backs, Breitbart News reported.

Sessions announced he released a memorandum for federal prosecutors ordering increased prosecutions of people who cross the border illegally, or those who are engaged in human smuggling. Acknowledging the decrease in border crossings since President Donald Trump took office in January, Sessions wrote that the DOJ must do its part in enforcing the law. “While dramatic progress has been made in recent months, much remains to be done,” the AG wrote. “It is critical that our work focus on criminal cases that will further reduce illegality.”

The DOJ tweeted some of Sessions remarks from the border.

Speaking to the CBP officers and Border Patrol agents, the AG said, “I am here to tell you, the brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection: we hear you and we have your back.”

“I am here to tell you, the brave men &amp; women of @CustomsBorder Protection: we hear you &amp; we have your back.”—Attorney General Sessions — Justice Department (@TheJusticeDept) April 11, 2017

“Together, we will drastically reduce the danger posed by criminal aliens, gang members, and cartel henchmen,” Sessions stated.

In a memorandum reported by KTAR news, Session stated, “As we speak, I am issuing a document to all federal prosecutors that mandates the prioritization of such enforcement.”

The memorandum calls for:

Prosecution for any case involving the transportation, or harboring of illegal aliens with prioritization of cases involving the smuggling or harboring of three or more aliens. Aggravating circumstances would also be considered for prioritization including cases where aliens receive serious bodily injury, physical or sexual assault, or the death of any person.

Felony prosecution for any defendant with two or more prior misdemeanor improper entry convictions, or one or more convictions with aggravating circumstances including prior felony criminal convictions; gang membership or affiliation; multiple prior voluntary returns; and prior removal, deportation, or exclusion.

Prosecution for previously deported criminal aliens with convictions of aggravated felonies, or prior criminal history indicating a danger to public safety. This category also includes prosecuting re-entrants with one or more administrative or criminal immigration violations, gang membership or affiliation or other aggravating circumstances.

Prosecution to the extent practicable cases of assault, resisting, or impeding officers engaged in the performance of their duties in administrative and criminal immigration enforcement.

Session also announced the creation of a Border Security Coordinator responsible for:

Overseeing the investigation and prosecution of the offenses listed above;

Attending training programs with other Coordinators regarding these offenses;

Providing legal advice and training to Assistant U.S. Attorneys on prosecuting these cases; and

Maintaining and reporting prosecution statistics related to the above listed offenses.

Sessions said the goal of these initiatives is to deter first-time improper entrants.

“For those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era. This is the Trump era,” Sessions concluded.

DOJ Memo on Renewed Commitment to Criminal Immigration Enforcement</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5ed6716f:7f517:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

One California State Senator has amended a bill to discriminate against any contractor who works on President Trump’s border wall—by banning them for life from being awarded any contracts with the state of California.

San Diego Tribune reports that State Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens has amended Senate Bill 30—initially a bill requiring state voter approval of any federally-funded infrastructure project built along “ California’s southern border”—which will now prohibit the state from contracting with any person or organization that provides any goods or services for the wall.

“It’s clear that President Trump intends to stick taxpayers with the cost of a border wall that will hurt California’s economy, environment and people,” Lara said in a statement according to the Tribune. “I introduced Senate Bill 30 to give our state a louder voice to say that building a wasteful and unnecessary wall would be a huge mistake.”

“Another wall will delay cargo delivery, slow down business and take away valuable jobs,” he wrote.

Lara is not the only California Democrat obsessed with Trump’s wall, but it seems to have clouded his judgement. This has nothing to do with saving money—Lara is the one who just proposed a California-based single-payer, universal health plan to include illegal aliens—which will cost taxpayers billions of dollars. Anyone familiar with the border knows that there are 25’ high walls topped with razor wire near San Diego’s largest port of entry for vehicles and cargo—and the only ‘cargo’ delayed would be cargo or persons entering the country illegally.

Building the border wall won’t ‘take away valuable jobs’ as Lara alleges—it will create badly-needed new jobs and protect Californians already employed by making illegal entry more difficult.

Since Trump’s election, state-sponsored hysteria has become the norm in California. Two San Francisco Supervisors are pushing an even tougher measure that would ban any company that bids on the border wall from consideration for city contracts.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, “any company looking at President Trump’s proposed border wall between Mexico and the United States as a business opportunity may soon want to reconsider—if it wants to do business with San Francisco.” Two supervisors introduced a local measure last month that would “bar San Francisco from contracting with companies that seek a deal to work on the wall during the bidding period, regardless of whether the companies win a contract.”

“It is time to move beyond symbolism and use the power we have as a city to fight for the values we hold most dear,” Supervisor Hillary Ronen told the Chronicle in March, who is introducing the measure with Supervisor Aaron Peskin.

Not surprisingly, other Bay Area cities are following suit. The Berkeley City Council unanimously passed a resolution as well advising the city to divest from any company involved in any aspect of the project. Oakland is moving forward with a similar resolution.

Since most government contractors seek to foster strong relationships with elected officials, it’s no surprise that those with the most to lose—huge mega corporations and global conglomerates—are being silent.

Among them are two companies that have massive contracts with the city, according to the SF Chronicle: “Hensel Phelps Construction Co. in Oakland, which recently signed a $1.1 billion contract to help build a new terminal at San Francisco International Airport and Tutor Perini Corp. of Sylmar (Los Angeles County). The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency has an $860 million contract with Tutor Perini to help construct the Central Subway,”—and Tutor Perini won the contract to build Jerry Brown’s High Speed Rail project.

Los Angeles Times reports that Mexico-based Cemex—one of the world’s largest suppliers of building materials—was considering a bid on the project, but spokesman Jorge Perez has since corrected the record. Not only will the company “not participate” in building the wall; it will also not supply materials to contractors working on the project.

Not everyone in San Francisco is supportive of the ban. One small contractor—who’s unlikely to meet the $25 million lead project experience requirement set out by Customs Border Protection to weed out smaller companies—spoke out against the ban in the Chronicle:

“My first reaction is why are taxpayer dollars being spent to hold committee meetings to boycott local companies that employ local workers? That’s a little on the radical side and basically, our taxpayer dollars are being used against us,” said James Flanagan, a San Francisco contractor.

California has long prided itself on being one of the ‘most tolerant’ states in the nation—and has passed hundreds of laws to prohibit discrimination in order to prove it.

It would be interesting to see what would happen if two words were added to the list of protected classes and then applied to every other anti-discrimination statute in the state—“Political Orientation” —and then further require every one of these “anti-discrimination” laws to apply to the California State government as well.

Now there’s an idea for a Republican member of the State Assembly or Senate—that is, if there are any left with the courage to expose the Democrat hypocrisy by introducing a new bill or an amendment requiring the state to “stop discriminating” against Californians on the basis of their “political beliefs or orientation.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Monday that dictator Bashar al-Assad had killed “more of his own people” in the recent chemical attack in Syria and that he hopes Assad “will not be a part” of the future in that country.

Tillerson’s comment, presented as a statement at the start of a press conference in Italy, is the strongest indication yet that the Trump administration sees Assad’s departure as part of the solution to ending the Syrian Civil War. The more than six-year-old conflict has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, including women and children.

Aside from the Assad regime, the Syrian population also faces threats from radical Islamic terrorists, including the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, and al-Qaeda.

“Last week, Bashar al-Assad’s regime killed even more of its own people using chemical weapons,” Tillerson said. “Our missile strike in response to his repeated use of banned weapons was necessary as a matter of U.S. national security interest.”

“We do not want the regime’s uncontrolled stockpile of chemical weapons to fall into the hands of ISIS or other terrorist groups who could, and want to, attack the United States or our allies,” Tillerson said.

“Many nations look to the Geneva process to resolve the Syrian conflict in a way that produces stability and gives Syria and the Syrian people the opportunity to determine their own political future,” Tillerson said. “And our hope is Bashar al-Assad will not be a part of that future.”

Ahead of his arrival in Moscow, Tillerson also placed the blame for the attack squarely on Russia.

“Russia has failed to uphold the agreements that had been entered into under multiple UN Security Council resolutions,” Tillerson said. “These agreements stipulated Russia as the guarantor of a Syria free of chemical weapons, that they would also locate, secure, and destroy all such armaments in Syria.”

“Stockpiles and continued use demonstrate that Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on this 2013 commitment,” Tillerson said. “It is unclear whether Russia failed to take this obligation seriously or Russia has been incompetent, but this distinction doesn’t much matter to the dead.”

“We can’t let this happen again,” Tillerson said.

In response to a reporter’s question, Tillerson repeated his belief that Assad’s days are numbered, but he said that what replaces the regime is also important.

“I think it is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end; but the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important, in our view, to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria, and its stability and durability of the outcome going forward,” Tillerson said.

Last week, Tillerson answered another reporter’s question about Assad and said his removal was already in the works.

“So will you and President Trump organize an international coalition to remove Assad?” the reporter asked.

“Those steps are under way,” Tillerson said.

And during the Q. and A. in Italy Tillerson made clear Russia has a choice to make.

“Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role, or Russia can maintain its alliance with this group, which we believe is not going to serve Russia’s interest longer-term,” Tillerson said. “But only Russia can answer that question.”

On Sunday, a Russian official said Russian President Vladimir Putin does not have plans to meet with Tillerson face-to-face, even though the two have met numerous times in the past when Tillerson was the CEO of ExxonMobile.

“We have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the president’s diary,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a Monday press conference call, according to Reuters.

Also on Sunday, Tillerson laid a wreath in the Tuscan village of Sant’Anna di Stazzema, the site of a Nazi massacre of more than 500 civilians during World War II. He also referenced the chemical weapon attack in Syria and pledged to protect innocent people around the globe.

“We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world,” Tillerson said. “This place will serve as an inspiration to us all.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5e234d78:2816960:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Attorney General Jeff Sessions broke from his tour of the U.S.-Mexico border Tuesday to announce his Justice Department’s sweeping plans for securing the border.

“For those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era. This is the Trump era,” Sessions told the crowd of Customs and Border Protection personnel in the border town of Nogales, Arizona. “We hear you and we have your back!” he assured them.

Sessions proceeded to lay out a multifaceted plan to stop illegal aliens entering the country. All adults apprehended at the border are to be detained and at least 125 additional immigration judges are to be appointed and put in the field on an expedited basis. Twenty-five immigration judges have already been deployed to detention centers along the border to help alleviate the massive backlog of cases already piled up there.

Accompanying the address, the Attorney General’s Office issued a memorandum to all US Attorney’s offices, instructing them on dramatically stricter prosecution guidelines for immigration offenses: all repeat illegal entry offenders are to be referred for felony prosecution; all cases in which an illegal alien is caught reentering the United States after removal are now to be considered for felony prosecution, with priority given to those with other criminal records or gang affiliations; prosecuting those caught transporting three or more illegal aliens will now be a priority; illegal aliens and their smugglers caught with fraudulent documentation, as they often are, are to be charged with aggravated identity theft; and prosecuting any assault on federal law enforcement, included CBP personnel, is to be a “top priority.”

“The catch and release practices of old are over,” Sessions said.

By the beginning of next week, every US Attorney’s office is to have a “Border Security Coordinator” to help carry out the Justice Department plan. Not only will those coordinators be charged with overseeing and advising on the new guidelines, they are commanded to assemble and report statistics on their implementation.

The Attorney General touted the 40 percent reported drop in illegal crossings at the southern border since President Donald Trump took office while unveiling the plan. “This is no accident,” he said. “This is what happens when you have a President who understands the threat, who is not afraid to publicly identify the threat and stand up to it.”

Sessions closed by referring back to the crimes by “caught and released” illegals that captured the nation’s attention:</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5e0f7391:2b5eb9e:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A recently-announced purchase of an American financial services corporation by a Chinese owned company may weaken President Trump’s efforts to make America great again and could set back Trump’s trade reform efforts.

The American people want fairness in trade. The problem with allowing any Chinese company to purchase an American company is that Communist China has engaged in numerous unfair trade practices with the United States.

One of the first problems with the trade relationship between the United States and China is the fact that China only likes competition in other markets, but not in China. The communist party in China subsidize and own corporations which guarantees that no firm will fail. This gives Chinese firms a financial leg up on competing with U.S. firms. China has been also accused of stealing trade secrets and intellectual property. Furthermore, Americans can’t go to China an invest in Chinese companies, so why would the United States allow Chinese nationals to invest in U.S. companies?

Financial markets should watch this deal closely to see if the deal will trigger existing law that empower President Donald Trump to block the purchase on national security grounds. If President Trump flexes some muscle, he may be able to leverage trade concessions from China.

A Chinese company, Ant Financial Services, announced a deal in January to acquire MoneyGram International for $880 million. According to Techcrunch, “Dallas-based MoneyGram is a service that handles cross-border currency transfers — remittance payments — in close to 200 countries, where it claims to have 350,000 physical locations. The company recorded $1.4 billion in revenue in 2015, but just 13 percent of which was from digital transactions highlighting its massive offline presence.” The deal must be approved by the US Treasury’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to be completed. Because of the sensitivity of financial transactions, this deal presents some significant concerns that should be the subject of deep study by CFIUS.

The Department of Treasury chairs CFIUS, which is empowered by law as “an inter-agency committee authorized to review transactions that could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person (“covered transactions”), in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States.” According to a report in Bloomberg, late in 2016, President Obama blocked a deal by the Chinese to purchase the American subsidiaries of the Germany’s Axixtron SE, a company that manufactures semiconductors, because “the national security risk posed by the transaction relates, among other things, to the military applications of the overall technical body of knowledge and experience of Aixtron.” There is recent precedent for a President to block a Chinese owned company from purchasing assets in the United States, so don’t be surprised if President Trump also goes down the same road.

Foreign ownership of U.S. companies has become more prevalent. When foreign nationals comes to the United States to purchase a large corporation, that triggers laws regarding the foreign ownership of U.S companies. When this purchaser is a Chinese national and the company provides financial services in the nature of cash transfers, that would seem to merit special oversight and review.

Americans have many choices when transferring cash, yet the act of transferring cash implicates obvious security concerns for citizens as recipients and as people transferring money. Choices for consumers to transfer money include the popular services of PayPal, Western Union, Google Wallet and Walmart transfers. MoneyGram, based in Dallas, Texas, is one of the larger companies and operates in over 200 countries with a global network of approximately 350,000 physical locations. The purchase of MoneyGram would provide Ant Financial with both a foothold in the US market. A transfer of ownership to the Chinese would seem to go against President Trump’s policy of keeping jobs at home and expanding the American owned corporate interests.

This proposed Chinese acquisition is an early opportunity for President Trump to make good on campaign promises on trade. This will be his first big test on the level and nature of Chinese investment in the United States. While China’s protectionists policies are getting worse not better, it seems unfair to give China a foothold into the United States financial markets until China becomes more open to American firms investing in China.

The deal may hurt the U.S. economy. Letting an American financial services corporation be bought out by a Chinese owned company seems to go against the trade policies being pushed by the Trump Administration and may lead to President Trump blocking this transaction using national security as a reason.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5d7a0231:26f0493:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Trump has turned into quite the promotional tool for Mexican sports fans.

First, the Mexican national soccer team used Trump in a promotional ad to rile the fan base prior to a game against Team USA. Now, boxing legend Oscar De La Hoya will use Trump, and the wall he would like to build, in order to promote an upcoming boxing match.

The fight will take place over the Cinco de Mayo weekend, and will feature Saul “Canelo” Alvarez versus Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. The ad will show both fighters crashing through a wall, specifically President Trump’s proposed wall along the southern border with Mexico. The ad will run on DirecTV and Dish Network.

According to the Washington Post, De La Hoya explained the reasoning behind the ad in a phone interview, “The idea of a wall was a direct hit to Donald Trump. Obviously, given what’ taken place, and given the comments that Trump has made had really impacted a lot of people and have rubbed many people the wrong way.

“This is letting him know that not every Mexican is what he’s stated they are. Mexicans are hard workers.”

Here, De La Hoya references comments made by Trump when he announced his candidacy for president in the summer of 2015. Trump pointed out, correctly, that Mexico has allowed rapists, drug dealers, and other kinds of criminals to cross the border into the U.S. However, Trump didn’t say that all Mexicans coming over the border were rapists and drug dealers.

Instead, he pointed out that there are “good people” among them as well, a fact conveniently omitted by De La Hoya.

Nevertheless, we get it: Trump says things other American politicians aren’t willing to say. It makes him a lightning rod, a focus of anger, and a go-to source when you need to gin up instant national angst.

But, why do you need to gin up instant national angst or anger in a fight between two Mexicans? The Mexican national team wanting to use Trump in an ad to fire people up before playing Team USA is understandable, given that was a game against America. But how does the America figure into this?

In fact, not only are neither of the fighters American, but Cinco de Mayo has nothing to do with the United States either. Though, it’s hard to get people excited about a game or a fight involving France.

The White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA) has tapped comedian Hasan Minhaj to headline the establishment media’s biggest annual event.

This year’s celebrity-studded dinner, which is set to take place April 29th, will feature members of Donald Trump’s administration and large swathes of media members. But the president, as he announced in February, won’t be attending the event.

Minhaj, however, a relatively unknown figure, has made a habit of hitting Donald Trump with personal insults.

The Daily Show star called Trump “White ISIS” during last year’s primaries and was featured in a recent Daily Show segment that highlighted the president’s greatest tweet of all time.

.@roywoodjr and @hasanminhaj announce the greatest Trump tweet of all time. pic.twitter.com/hgbvGmxIUJ — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) April 6, 2017

Minhaj also mocked President Trump in a statement thanking the WHCA for selecting him to host.

“It is a tremendous honor to be a part of such a historic event even though the president has chosen not to attend this year. SAD!” Minhaj said. “Now more than ever, it is vital that we honor the First Amendment and the freedom of the press.”

While the WHCA dinner tends to feature a comedian who mocks the president and the press, the WHCA chief says picking an anti-Trump host was not the message his organization wanted to send.

“I was not looking for somebody who was going to roast the president in absentia. That’s not fair, and that’s not the message that we want to get across,” WHCA president Jeff Mason said Tuesday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “I was looking for somebody who is funny and who is entertaining, because I want the dinner to be entertaining, but who can also speak to the message that the whole dinner is going to speak to … the importance of a free press.”

Nevertheless, Minhaj’s being selected to headline the WHCA dinner will likely parallel the event’s past jeering of Trump. At 2011’s dinner, Trump was skewered by both Barack Obama and that night’s comedic relief Seth Myers.

And if Minhaj goes full anti-Trump while hosting, the WHCA dinner will likely intensify the hostility between the president and the media.

Defeating the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) remains the United States’ primary goal in Syria, not toppling the country’s dictator Bashar al-Assad, according to high-ranking officials in President Donald Trump’s administration.

Trump’s United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley suggested that U.S.-backed regime change in Syria is likely.

“Regime change is something that we think is going to happen, because all of the parties are going to see that Assad’s not the leader that needs to be taking place for Syria,” Haley told CNN.

Some analysts and American lawmakers accused the Trump administration of sending mixed messages on its Syria policy, noting that while Haley indicated that getting rid of Assad is the administration’s priority, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson maintained that the U.S. is focused on defeating ISIS.

In separate interviews on Sunday, Tillerson and Trump’s national security adviser H.R. McMaster noted that the administration’s decision to bomb Assad last week is not a sign that America has shifted its primary focus from defeating ISIS to pushing the Syrian dictator from power.

“Our priority is first the defeat of ISIS,” Tillerson told George Stephanopoulos, host of ABC News’s This Week on Sunday. “Once we can eliminate the battle against ISIS, conclude that—and it is going quite well—then we hope to turn our attention to cease-fire agreements between the regime and opposition forces.”

Lt. Gen. McMaster agreed that defeating ISIS must come “first,” adding, “Then also, it has to be a significant change in the nature of the Assad regime and its behavior in particular.”

Asked about the alleged “mixed signals” on Trump’s Syria policy sent by Haley and the Tillerson, Lt. Gen. McMaster also told “Fox News Sunday” host, Chris Wallace:

Both Secretary Tillerson and Ambassador Haley are right about this. What we really need to do, and what everyone who’s involved in this conflict needs to do is to do everything they can to resolve this civil war, to halt this humanitarian catastrophe, this political catastrophe, not only in Syria, but the catastrophe is affecting the greater Middle East, it’s affecting Europe and it’s a threat to the American people as well. And so, to do that, what’s required is some kind of a political solution to that very complex problem… we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to affect that change.

Last week, President Trump ordered the U.S. military to strike an Assad base in northwestern Syria believed to have been housing the pilots who carried out a chemical weapons attack last Tuesday that killed as many as 100 people, including at least 27 children.

Citing a senior U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Associated Press (AP) reports that Russia knew of last week’s chemical weapons assault in advance.

“Russia’s got to tell us which one it is. Either they knew that there were chemical weapons and they knew there was going to be chemical-weapons use and they just hid it from the international community, or they’re being played for fools by Assad by him having chemical weapons and they’re just in the dark and they don’t know anything about it,” declared Haley.

Support from Iran and Russia has kept Assad in power. Iran-allied fighters, including members of the terrorist group Hezbollah, and Russian military forces are fighting alongside Assad troops.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5d660f5c:2a4d106:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who said “goodbye” to diplomacy with the United States last year, is now urging his American counterparts to work with Manila in combating terrorism and other mutual threats.

The request for cooperation, which comes soon after the U.S. bombed the Russia– and Iran-backed Syrian regime, marks a departure from the anti-American sentiment Duterte repeatedly expressed in response to former President Barack Obama’s criticism of the Philippines’ bloody war on drugs.

President Duterte repeatedly claimed he had “realigned” himself ideologically with Russia and China after he claimed to end the Philippines’ relationship with the United States.

Citing historical ties between the Philippines and the United States on Sunday, however, President Duterte declared, “As we fought together to stay above the enemy then, so we should help each other to address the threats that confront our societies, our region, and our world,” reports the Southeast Asian country’s ABS-CBN News.

“Now the menace of terrorism, violent extremism and transnational crimes such as the illegal drug trade have called into question, efforts uphold the responsibility to defend the common good,” he added.

Michael Klecheski, the deputy chief of mission at U.S. Embassy in Manila, agreed with the Philippines leader.

“Today the new challenge of terrorism has emerged,” he said, adding, “We must also remember the importance of standing together as what the Philippines and the United States have done for many decades.”

The Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) has established a presence in the Philippines with the help of its affiliate Abu Sayyaf, a jihadist group based in the Southeast Asian nation.

Under Obama’s watch last year, President Duterte said “goodbye” to the Philippines’ long-time friendship with the United States.

“I announce my separation from the United States both in the military… not social, but economics also. America has lost,” proclaimed Duterte in October 2016.

“You know, if China and Russia would decide to create a new order, I would be the first to join,” he stressed in November.

However, the Philippines president has apparently changed his mind.

Duterte indicated this month that he plans to respect the Philippines’ military agreement with the United States, which prohibits Manila from forging military alliances with any other country.

Moreover, the Philippines leader vowed to “give all” to support President Donald Trump.

“I am okay with President Trump and I can assure him also of our friendship and cooperation,” he said in March.

“But for the previous president, I was an evil man,” added Duterte. “That crazy man was planning to jail me. This other one [Trump], he said, ‘you’re right.’”

Trump has reportedly expressed support for Duterte’s deadly anti-drug campaign, a claim that has not been confirmed by the U.S. administration.

The Philippines’ efforts against the illegal use of drugs has resulted in the extra-judicial killings of thousands.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5d660f5c:2a4d105:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump again urged China to do something about North Korea’s increasingly hostile actions in the region, insisting that the United States would act if China did not.

Trump recapped his meeting with President Xi Jinping last week at Mar-a-lago in a series of messages on Twitter on Tuesday.

“North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A.,” he wrote.

Trump’s statements reflect a growing hostility to North Korea as the United States has sent the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier and it’s supporting fleet to the Korean Peninsula.

“I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!” Trump added.

North Korea signaled via their state media that officials were “ready to react to any mode of war desired by the U.S.”

Last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that Trump wanted China to address the threat posed to North Korea, signaling that the United States was prepared to act unilaterally.

“[W]e understand it creates unique problems for them and challenges and that we would, and are, prepared to chart our own course if this is something China is just unable to coordinate with us,” Tillerson said.

World leaders are now taking Trump’s threats of military action more seriously, particularity after he ordered a missile strike on Syria in response to their use of chemical weapons.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5d4bff65:2a1b8c6:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, rejected a call by the panel’s former chairman Sunday for him to recuse himself from an investigation into Russian interference.

Former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) called on Schiff to recuse himself from the investigation because he characterized classified intelligence in the media — the same thing left-wing groups have gone after Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) for doing.

“For his part, Schiff suggested to the media that he had seen information on Russia-Trump campaign ties that was ‘the kind of evidence’ that would be presented to a grand jury, adding that he had seen additional evidence, but not elaborating further,” Rogers wrote in an op-ed Saturday on CNN.com.

Specifically, Schiff had said March 23 on CNN:

I do think that it’s appropriate to say that it’s the kind of evidence that you would submit to a grand jury at the beginning of an investigation. It’s not the kind of evidence that you take to a trial jury when you’re trying to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. But we’re at the beginning of an investigation, and given the gravity of the subject matter, I think that the evidence certainly warrants us doing a thorough investigation.

An aide told CNN later that Schiff was not suggesting that a grand jury should be empaneled, but was using an analogy drawing upon his time as a prosecutor.

Nunes last week announced he was temporarily recusing himself from the Russian investigation, after MoveOn.org and other groups filed a complaint against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics, arguing that he discussed classified intelligence and broke House rules.

“Equally, Representative Adam Schiff should consider recusing himself from the probe,” Rogers wrote.

“Both Nunes and Schiff are equally to blame for the Committee’s loss of focus. How can a committee, which handles sensitive classified information, conduct its business when the purportedly secret information is discussed — even by insinuation — publicly in front of the media?” he wrote.

Schiff said he didn’t think Rogers’ suggestion “is a serious one” in an interview Sunday on ABC News This Week:

A lot of us have characterized how we’ve seen the intelligence. Some have said it looks more like smoke than fire. Some of us said it’s a small fire. Some have said they’ve seen no evidence. Mr. Rogers and others don’t quarrel with those who say they’ve seen no evidence. I don’t think that’s an accurate assessment. And I certainly don’t think I can let it stand. But I don’t think Mr. Rogers’ suggestion is a serious one.

The ethics charges against Nunes were filed six days after he told reporters he saw evidence that members of President Trump’s transition team were caught up in incidental surveillance of foreign targets, and had their identities “unmasked,” despite protections put in place to keep Americans’ identities anonymous in such cases. He had also briefed the president, before going to other members on the committee.

In February, the classified conversations between incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak were illegally leaked to the Washington Post. On April 3, conservative blogger Mike Cernovich first reported that former Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice had ordered the unmasking.

Nunes’ revelation was seen as somewhat validating Trump’s assertion that his transition team at Trump Tower had been “wiretapped” by the Obama administration.

Nunes blasted the ethics charges as “entirely false and politically motivated,” and questioned the timing.

The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power.

Schiff demurred on whether those complaints against Nunes were justified.

“I just don’t know,” he said. “And I really don’t want to opine on the ethics investigation.”

Rogers said Nunes’ decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe “should be applauded,” as attention had focused on him, and not the committee or the issues it handles.

Rogers said leaks related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows surveilllance of individuals inside the U.S. with a warrant, should be handed over to the FBI for investigation.

“FISA warrants are amongst the most sensitive operations undertaken by the intelligence community and should never be used as a political tool, for anyone’s agenda, or anything beyond what it is meant to be used for — investigations of foreign intelligence actions,” he said.

He also said the committee should focus on investigating Russia’s intentions, information operations capabilities, and Moscow’s widespread use of social media as part of its propaganda and subversion campaigns.

“Make no mistake about it, the Russians are aiming to not only undermine and subvert our political process, but the political processes of our friends and allies in Europe,” he said.

Schiff said with Nunes stepping aside from leading the Russia investigation, it is “back on track.” He said Republicans and Democrats have exchanged lists of witnesses to bring in to testify, and are “largely” in agreement. The final list is not yet finalized, a committee aide said.

He disputed reports that the investigation was ever on hold and said the materials that Nunes had viewed was now being made available to the full committee.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5d4bff65:2a1b8c4:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Ben Rhodes, who ran foreign policy errands for President Barack Obama as Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications &amp; Speechwriting, created an infamous “echo chamber” of fake news to sell the Iran deal.

Now, Rhodes is part of a new echo, repeating and retweeting left-wing smears aimed at one of his successors, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Deputy Assistant to President Donald Trump and a key media spokesman for the White House.

Rhodes first took aim at Gorka in response to a tweet by Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman under President Obama who infamously attempted to dismiss the Benghazi scandal by telling Fox News’ Bret Baier: “Dude, this was like two years ago.” Vietor was, in turn, quoting a Newsweek article criticizing Gorka for criticizing a critic for criticizing his credentials. Rhodes piled on, mocking the “Breitbart credentialed Gorka” for his sensitivity.

Rhodes and Vietor ought to be the last to question anyone’s credentials. Rhodes had no national security experience before being plucked from a struggling career as a fiction writer and promoted up the ladder. Vietor was literally the “dude” who drove the press van for Obama on the campaign trail. Both symbolize the callow nature and frat-house culture of the Obama West Wing. (Rhodes still claims today that Syria gave up “all” of its chemical weapons in 2013.)

Since that first swipe in February, Rhodes has joined the latest round of smears aimed at Gorka, tweeting an article from the Forward that attempted — and failed — to prove that Gorka supported an antisemitic Hungarian militia.

This person works in the WH: “Gorka…publicly supported a violent racist and anti-Semitic militia” https://t.co/bB6ljaUBGL via @jdforward — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) April 3, 2017

(Be warned before clicking on the link to the Forward article itself: readers are hit with a popup request for donations to continue funding the smear campaign against Gorka. They are literally fundraising off this character assassination.)

The poorly-written article included an old video interview in Hungarian with Gorka, with English subtitles — but the video was obviously spliced together. The raw video was also provided, but without subtitles.

David Reboi of RedState undertook a full translation. As David P. Goldman of PJ Media noted, “the Forward’s clip edits out Gorka’s denunciation of the anti-Semitic parties for exploiting popular fears in order to advance their own agenda” (original emphasis).

A lie good enough, as the joke goes, for government work — or post-government work, in Rhodes’s case. He tweeted later: “Picture if Gorka was a Muslim who supported an anti-Semitic militia and had associations with Nazi groups. Would he be in the White House?”

Here Rhodes did more than repeat the false accusations in the Forward: he also took aim at Gorka’s notable criticism of radical Islam, a threat Rhodes and his former boss refused even to pronounce.

The culmination of this new “echo chamber” came last weekend, with an NBC News piece that tried, and failed, to prove Gorka’s associations with Hungarian extremists but smeared him anyway, citing a fraudulent organization.

And so a smear that started with a discredited report on an anti-Israel blog has been promoted, via the Forward — which has an actual problem with antisemitism, having linked Zionists absurdly and outragously with Nazis — into the front ranks of the mainstream media and finally to the big network news stage, but remains essentially empty.

It is the “echo chamber,” reborn — or, rather, undead, a sort of zombie, totally impervious to truth.

Note that none of Gorka’s detractors actually question his support for Israel, or even his links with Jews, because they do not care.

The echo chamber depends on a factual void, and repetition by false authorities. Just ask the man who invented it.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer argued that President Donald Trump’s foreign policy doctrine remains “America’s First” despite his decision to launch missile strikes in Syria.

“I think the Trump doctrine is something that he articulated throughout the campaign, which is that America’s first,” Spicer told Breitbart News during the White House press briefing.

Spicer added that the Trump administration would protect America’s interests in regards to national security and its economic priorities.

“We’re not just going to become the world’s policeman running around the world,” he said.

The president would have a “clear and defined national interest,” whenever he launched a military attack, Spicer stated.

He argued that it was within America’s national interests to oppose the use and spread of weapons of mass destruction.

“If there is a growth of use or spread of chemical weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation of those, the spread to other groups is a clear danger to our country and to our people,” Spicer said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5b90cb36:270aced:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

An article from The Arizona Daily Sun that was published this week falsely branded Campus Reform, the online conservative campus watchdog site, as “alt-right.”

Campus Reform, which is a part of The Leadership Institute Network, is an online news site that reports on incidents of political bias at institutions of higher education around the United States.

Although the site has an obvious conservative editorial stance, it is unclear why Arizona Daily Sun reporter Suzanne Adams-Ockrassa would choose to label the site “alt-right.”

The article detailed student concern that a video from a campus forum event at Northern Arizona University appeared in an article at Campus Reform.

The video, which includes an NAU professor calling President Trump “the rapist in chief,” was posted in an article at Campus Reform and sparked backlash on campus and on social media.

Adams-Ockrassa also calls the Professor Watchlist, a project of Turning Point USA that serves as a directory of radical leftists in academia, an “alt-right” website, despite little evidence that Turning Point USA and the watchlist are anything other than products of mainstream conservatism.

Closing down the U.S. Education Department (USED) could be a snap compared to repealing and replacing Obamacare.

A bill, House Resolution 899, filed by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and seven co-sponsors on the day Betsy DeVos was confirmed as education secretary would start the beginning of USED’s deconstruction with just one wonderfully succinct sentence: “The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2018.” That is the entirety of the bill. The contrast with hard-to-fathom legislation running hundreds or even thousands of pages is refreshing. And the sunset for an agency that has generated more red tape than positive results over its nearly four-decade run would be absolutely gorgeous.

USED is a monument to the failure of the strategy to use centralized education policymaking to boost learning. Furthermore, its ventures into shaping and tracking student feelings, attitudes, beliefs, and dispositions have become steadily more of a threat to individual liberty.

President Donald Trump has in the past signaled his possible support for shuttering USED, but Trump’s initial budgetary blueprint funds the department at $59 billion for fiscal year 2018. His budget would eliminate several unproductive programs, such as the so-called 21st Century Learning Centers, at a total savings of $9 billion (a “cut” of 13 percent for USED). Trump’s plan would continue to protect funding for disabled students, historically black colleges, and other causes.

The education establishment’s trumpet, Education Week, wrote of the “historic” Trump commitment to school choice, implying it basically supplants such supposedly popular programs as subsidized after-school activities. However, the bulk of the $1.4 billion earmarked for choice would enable some low-income parents to transfer their kids to other public schools—not exactly a robust choice. A $168 million increase in federal start-up money for charter schools would raise the danger of increased federal regulation of charters while possibly further impinging on the ability of Catholic schools to compete in the education marketplace. Only the proposed $250 million federal scholarship program for private choice is potentially ground-breaking; however, such an approach carries the danger of federal agendas intruding in voucher-recipient private or homeschools.

Given the likelihood of USED continuing to devour tax dollars with precious little bang for the buck, Massie’s idea of a deadline for closing the department makes sense. Congress and the states would have almost two years to decide what to do with any USED remnants that might be recycled usefully and how to redirect the $60 billion funding stream. The objective would not be scrapping education – as critics surely would charge – but rather deciding what degree of government involvement is helpful and what part is destructive. In addition, decisions would have to be made on returning tax dollars to state and local governments—or, even better, to taxpayers.

Some federal agencies already administer education programs independently of USED. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture makes low-interest, long-term loans to organizers of charter schools in rural areas and runs the federal school-lunch program. And perhaps not realized widely is the Department of Health and Human Services is in charge of the Head Start preschool program, which may help with some poor kids’ health but not so much with sustained achievement gains.

One transfer of USED responsibility before the end of 2018 might be the huge student-loan program, which the Treasury Department logically could direct. (Trump’s budget would level-fund Pell Grants for low-to-moderate income students at $22 billion.) As an extension of that move, Washington, DC, could consider restoring a role for the private banking industry in making guaranteed student loans, a role the Obama administration eliminated in 2010 in keeping with its government-knows-best bias. If any productive job-training programs exist within USED, they probably would be a fit in the Labor Department.

In a USA Today article, Massie stated the 10 percent of education funding that passes through USED could be redirected in three ways: (1) preserving the federal programs, but transferring them to other departments—arguably the “least disruptive option”; (2) block-granting all the money to states, where state departments of education would become the overseers; or (3) devolving “all education spending, including the collection of taxes, to the state and local levels.”

A second bill, House Resolution 1510, proposing to close USED went into the House of Representatives’ hopper March 17. Sponsored by Rep. David Rouzer (R-NC), it would combine a couple of Massie’s options, including transferring certain USED’s functions (such as special education and student loans) to other federal agencies and returning some money for locally set priorities, such as teacher pay raises, school construction, and technological upgrades.

These bids to decentralize education by dismantling USED merit serious consideration in Congress and the White House. Parental choice in education can never be fully realized when remote bureaucrats exercise ultimate control.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview last week in her office on Capitol Hill that Republicans are preparing already for what they expect may be a landslide midterm electoral victory that sweeps in as many as 14 GOP pickups in the U.S. Senate and not only holds but strengthens the House GOP majority.

McDaniel, who took over the RNC after her predecessor Reince Priebus joined President Donald Trump’s White House as Chief of Staff, said in the half-hour-long interview on Thursday afternoon:

On the Senate side, we have a great opportunity to expand our majority in the Senate. There are 10 states where President Trump won where we have Democrat incumbents and President Trump won by large margins in some of those states. We also have infrastructure in some of those states already. The RNC had a ground game in Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. We need to be continuing to build on that infrastructure in these Senate races. We know the Democrats are rebuilding. We can turn out our vote. We need to be prepared to do that and continue to engage our voters so we can expand our majority in the Senate. On the House side, typically the party that has the White House loses the majority in the midterms—that’s been the historic trend. We want to buck that trend. We want to deliver for President Trump majorities in the House and the Senate so that he can govern.

In the U.S. Senate races, a particularly interesting picture emerges that heavily favors Republicans. Republicans must only defend nine seats—seven of which are in the deep red states of Wyoming, Utah, Texas, Tennessee, Nebraska, Alabama and Mississippi. Only two GOP senators, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada, are expected to potentially see competitive races. The other side of the aisle is much more promising for the GOP, and troubling for Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has more than half his conference—23 Democrats and both independents who caucus with Democrats—facing reelection in 2018.

The 10 states where President Trump won in 2016 and Democrats face reelection battles, are: Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Montana, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and West Virginia. McDaniel told Breitbart News that Republicans will compete to flip these seats—occupied currently by Democratic Sens. Bill Nelson (D-FL), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Jon Tester (D-MT), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Joe Manchin (D-WV)—into GOP control.

But it’s not just those Senate seats that are competitive: McDaniel points to several other Democratic senators and independents who caucus with Democrats—like Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota, Bob Menendez in New Jersey, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Angus King of Maine, and even Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—who are potentially vulnerable.

Trump narrowly missed upsetting Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in Minnesota, finishing with 45,000 votes less than Clinton there—making Klobuchar’s reelection even tougher if a Trump-like populist emerges as the GOP senatorial nominee there. Menendez is under criminal indictment and will face trial beginning later this year, giving Republicans an opportunity in New Jersey. Trump was competitive in New Mexico, as he finished less than 70,000 votes behind Clinton—who got less than 50 percent of the vote there—and Heinrich won in 2012 with just 51 percent of the vote.

Kaine’s closeness to Clinton’s failure, and his continued refusal to work on a bipartisan basis with the Trump administration, puts Virginia back in play, and Trump’s win in Maine’s second congressional district, netting him one electoral vote, makes King’s chances in Maine at reelection an interesting proposition—particularly if a populist like Gov. Paul LePage were to throw his hat in the ring. Republican governors in Vermont and Massachusetts prove the GOP can win in both states, and Republicans are likely to confront at least Warren but maybe even Sanders on their home turf.

“I think we will be in play in about 16 seats,” McDaniel told Breitbart News. “Two of them will be Arizona and Nevada, which we’ll be defending for Republicans, and then there’s opportunities—Virginia even has an opportunity. We’re not going to concede anything. We’re going to put the best ground game in place. We want to expand our majority in the Senate. Ideally, we’d love to get to 60. But this is the best map we’ve seen in a midterm from a Senate perspective in a long time and we want to capitalize on that.”

On the House side, Republicans currently hold 237 seats—218 are needed for a majority—with a handful of vacancies, most of which the GOP is expected to pick up. It will be a tougher battle for the GOP to hold that majority, but McDaniel is confident that the party can do it and will. She said:

We’re going to make sure that it holds. That’s our job. But we’re not going to take anything for granted. The Democrats have figured out that they have become complacent. They haven’t invested in the mechanics of trying to get out their vote—and they’re trying to organize using opposition and obstruction to engage their voters, and we have to make sure that we’re staying a step ahead of them so that we can continue to have those majorities, expand those majorities but most importantly we want to see President Trump accomplish all that he wants to in his final two years of his first term.

In terms of Democratic obstruction of President Trump’s agenda, McDaniel points to the “unprecedented” attempted-but-failed filibuster of now-Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch last week. Only three Democrats voted for his confirmation, forcing Senate Republicans to use what is called the nuclear option to navigate around arcane Senate rules to get Gorsuch confirmed. McDaniel believes the failed obstruction of Gorsuch will backfire on many of the Democrats who participated in Schumer’s games in the Senate. McDaniel said:

They’re putting their party above the people of their states. People came out and voted for President Trump. People like Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly, they decided to come across, but the rest of the Democrats—Claire McCaskill, Debbie Stabenow, Tammy Baldwin—they know that Republicans and Democrats in their states voted for Donald Trump because they wanted to see him appoint a Supreme Court Justice. But they have decided to go with their political party over the will of the people of their states. I think there will be ramifications for them, and their voters are going to have to take note that they decided to filibuster successfully—for the first time in history—filibuster a Supreme Court nominee who was immensely qualified, had bipartisan support, impeccable credentials, and why did they do it? Because they’re not there to serve the people of their state. They’re there to serve their political party.

What’s more, McDaniel took issue with Democratic leadership embracing the far-leftwing outside-the-mainstream “resist” movement against President Trump and his highly popular agenda. She predicted that Democrats will pay a serious price for throwing in with hardcore progressives in ways that in many cases undermine the voters in their states. She said:

They’ve been completely obstructive to anything the President is trying to accomplish. Their leadership used rhetoric like ‘resist’—that’s their new buzzword, ‘resist.’ What are you resisting? Are you resisting fixing healthcare that’s falling apart and helping millions of Americans whose premiums are going up? Are you resisting better jobs? Are you resisting better trade deals for people in my state of Michigan? Are you resisting coal jobs? What are they resisting? The Democratic leadership has decided ‘we are not going to help or come to the table on anything.’ It’s unprecedented. Barack Obama had more good will or support from Republicans. He certainly didn’t deal with these for Supreme Court nominees. I think the voters are going to look at this and say the Democrat Party is the ‘party of no.’ They’re the party of going to Washington and getting nothing done. And the Republican Party and President Trump are the ones out there trying to make our lives better. They’re fighting for our jobs, they’re fighting for better healthcare, and we’re going to see that come up in the midterms as we continue to gain seats.

McDaniel says that the legacy, establishment media outlets—dubbed the “opposition party” by President Trump and his chief strategist former Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon—have been over-the-top and unfair to President Trump. She says that the media seems uninterested in reporting on anything that President Trump does that is positive for the voters like those in her home state of Michigan who sent Trump to the White House. She went on to say:

It’s hard to watch the media not give our president a chance. And I actually went to dinner last night with a girlfriend of mine from Maryland and she actually said to me ‘I can’t even turn on the news anymore. I don’t even know what’s true anymore.’ I mean, that’s where it’s gotten. It’s a sad state when they have an agenda, it feels like they don’t want to give him an opportunity to succeed. And it feels like they are putting opinions out there as journalists and not giving a balanced view of what’s happening in Washington. We’re not hearing about the deregulation. We’re not hearing about Ford investing jobs in Michigan, or Carrier—we’re not hearing about these things. There are great stories to tell but we’re not hearing these things. That’s what seems so unbalanced and unfair, and our president deserves a chance.

But McDaniel is most concerned with holding together Trump’s new populist coalition with the rest of the Republican Party. Being a member of the Romney family—she is the 2012 GOP presidential nominee’s niece—but also from the rust belt state of Michigan, McDaniel is a walking contradiction inside the GOP. She is blue collar enough to appeal to the grassroots and American workers—including crossover union worker Democrats, dubbed “Trumpocrats”—who handed Trump the win in states like hers. But she’s also got deep enough ties into the GOP establishment and donor class community to be able to hold together the old elements of the GOP with the new elements as it becomes the party of Trump.

McDaniel finds herself atop a party that has been in recent years–to put it mildly–splintered by infighting, but hope is not lost for GOP unity. She may be just the person–as a Romney family member who also has deep personal ties to the very populist nationalist rust belt voters who fueled Trump’s revolution–to unite the party behind the president and his agenda. McDaniel, throughout her interview with Breitbart News, easily explained the frustrations of those Trump voters across America–and was clear in articulating support for the president’s populist policy viewpoints on trade and the economy.

She bashed the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) that President Trump ripped up, and praised the president for his role in bringing Ford and General Motors jobs back to Michigan. And as the newly instated chairwoman of the RNC, she could be the missing GOP link that bridges together that populist wing of the party with an increasingly distant establishment wing–welding together a lasting coalition that Trump and his advisers predict could keep Trump-like Republicans in power for decades if done right.

McDaniel told Breitbart News that the most potent political weapon that President Trump has brought to the Republican Party is that coalition that won him the rust belt—from Pennsylvania through Ohio up to Michigan and over to Wisconsin—and its 64 electoral votes. Part of her job at the RNC is to marry that new wing of the GOP that Trump has brought in with the more traditional Republicans—and keep the two sides talking, and discussing Trump’s victories and achievements.

McDaniel said:

We know who those voters are. We had a data sharing agreement with the Trump campaign, the RNC did, which he generously agreed to. We have to continue to interact with, message with and engage with those voters on a regular basis. So we’re letting them know when he’s in Michigan and adding more jobs and focusing on the Michigan economy and we have to message that to them and show them the action behind the campaign promises. So far, we’re seeing that those voters are still for Donald Trump, they’re still engaged with him. We’re going to continue to build that coalition going into 2018 and into 2020.

McDaniel added that the reason why Trump won Michigan—her state—is because he zoned in on that populist message, something he has already begun delivering on in the White House:

First of all, President Trump showed up in our state and had a conversation with our voters and his message really resonated. He talked about fair trade, he talked about jobs and the economy and national security, but he really talked about how people in Michigan—many of them—felt left behind, that many of them haven’t had a voice in Washington. They’re not represented by lobbyists or the politically elite. He said ‘I’m going to go to Washington, you deserve somebody who’s going to be a voice for you and be a champion for the things that you care about and somebody who is going to get things done.’ I think that really resonated with Michiganders, and we’re seeing that it is still resonating even with Democrats who crossed over and independents who felt like Donald Trump represented a new voice for them. He’s delivering. We’ve already seen an investment come back to Michigan from Ford and GM, we’ve seen him pull out of TPP, he’s talked about the need to go away from multilateral trade deals to bilateral. Those are the type of things that are going to continue to resonate with voters in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

She said the Democrats, particularly Clinton’s campaign, were shocked when they realized in the final week that Trump might win Michigan.

“Bill, and Barack Obama came, and Bill again—now she did go to Grand Rapids, which was smart,” McDaniel said. “I know a lot of people thought that wasn’t smart, but we knew our numbers were not at the Romney levels—I was so glad the President came to Grand Rapids to finish off the election. But they [the Democrats] were panicking. They blanketed the airwaves with all anti-Trump ads—everything. No vision, nothing put forward.”

But Trump’s win in Michigan was not a surprise to her—in fact, polling and other indicators as far back as the summer of 2016 were hinting it might break for Trump, she said. McDaniel went on:

They weren’t listening to even their Democrats in the state who said ‘there’s something going on here.’ But they also didn’t have a ground game. The RNC, we were investing in Michigan two years before. I knew, probably in June—I was getting polling from Macomb and Monroe and the upper peninsula in our statehouse seats. Trump was doing so well, and the RNC was investing in that door knocking so we started to recognize the shift in the voters. They [the DNC and Clinton campaign] weren’t on the ground, so they weren’t seeing it. We put offices in Macomb, we put offices in the UP, and we put offices down river—places that aren’t traditionally Republican areas—and we knew that ‘we’ve got to go knock this many doors this weekend, we’ve got to be in these precincts.’ They [Democrats] just didn’t have the data or the intelligence. They were using predictive modeling without that human component of knocking doors. They missed it because they assumed they had it. The night of the election, the Democrat chair and I—we spent a lot of time together, so after we finished interviews we said ‘you tell me what your polling is saying and I’ll tell you what my polling is saying.’ Because my polling was saying that Trump was going to win by 8,000 votes, and that’s the RNC. It was right. His said ‘we’re going to win by 5 points.’ So when you think you’re going to win a state by 5 points, of course you don’t invest. You just don’t. It changes your compass. That’s why the data and ground game are so critical. I think Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are just—when you’re winning on the margins, it’s your get-out-the-vote and who had the better ground game on top of having a phenomenal candidate.

Not only is McDaniel readying the GOP for the midterms, but she is also preparing the party for President Trump’s reelection in 2020—which she thinks may even lead to as big a victory as Ronald Reagan had in 1984 when he won 49 states in his reelection—and she sees the next cycle after this one as a place to build up the highly successful party even more. She told Breitbart News:

We’re focusing on 2020 right now. We’ve got—the great thing is, with the states we’ve won in 2016 we’ve got this new corridor, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, we already have the infrastructure there and we have Senate races in all of those states too so we’ll continue to build that. Then we go into 2020 and looking at what we’re seeing from the White House with tax reform and infrastructure and the things they’re going to put in place, yeah I could see a big win. We just got to keep that momentum going into the midterms. That’s when they’re going to put their best efforts forward.

Another top mission for McDaniel is exposing Democrats and particularly her counterparts in the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Newly elected DNC chair Tom Perez said at a rally recently in Newark, New Jersey, that Republicans “don’t give a shit about people.”

Tom Perez won&apos;t apologize for saying Republicans &quot;don&apos;t give a shit about people&quot; https://t.co/YdBCbG8eXe — Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) April 2, 2017

When asked to respond to Perez’s comments—for which he has refused to apologize—McDaniel blasted the DNC and the Democratic Party for moving so far outside the mainstream to the radical left. She said:

It shows how left the Democratic Party is going and how unreasonable and unhinged they’ve really become. To have the Democratic chair say that Republicans don’t give a bleep about people and then to not backtrack and to not have people within his own party denounce those statements, it just shows they’re not willing to work with the Republicans on anything. And two, they’re going to double down on the rhetoric that he’s using to continue to divide and create opposition to anything President Trump wants to accomplish.

At that rally in Newark, Perez also inaccurately stated that President Trump “didn’t win the election.” McDaniel told Breitbart News in response to Perez’s false claims that Trump did not win:

This is what the Democrats have been doing.They continue to try to delegitimize the president. He won. We know he won by an overwhelming electoral margin. But they’re also delegitimizing the voters, people like the voters in my state of Michigan—people who President Trump came and talked to, and cared about their issues and said ‘I’m going to go to Washington and be a champion for you’ and the Democrats are refusing to acknowledge that they lost those voters and that President Trump presented a vision that they believed in.

One chief method that Democrats have been using to attempt to undermine and “delegitimize” President Trump, McDaniel told Breitbart News, is the narrative on Russian intervention in the U.S. election. McDaniel said she is confident that not only will Trump be vindicated in the end as a result of the various investigations on Capitol Hill, but that there may be some serious questions regarding ex-Obama administration officials like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice and others when it comes to potentially unlawful surveillance of the Trump campaign and transition, questionable unmasking of Trump campaign officials in collected surveillance, and the eventual likely illegal leaking of said intelligence information to the media.

McDaniel said:

The House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee are investigating everything having to do with Russia and I expect we will find there is no there there when it comes to the Trump campaign. I do think we need to figure out where these leaks are coming from, and as it relates to Susan Rice and her involvement in unmasking Trump campaign officials and taking their names from essentially being classified to unclassified—I think we need to figure out why she did that and why she would have allowed that to happen. She has a credibility issue. This is the Susan Rice that went on TV after our ambassador was killed [in Benghazi] and said that it was prompted by a spontaneous event due to a video. We know now that it was an orchestrated terrorist attack to kill our ambassador. She was dishonest with the American people then, and we need to figure out if she’s being honest with the American people right now.

While the DNC faced serious problems post-election electing a new chair—Perez was locked in a bitter battle with Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) for their party’s reins, and now Ellison serves as Perez’s deputy at the DNC—the RNC, McDaniel says, was up and running quickly post-election:

I had to hit the ground running. I knew there’s not a ton of time to build a nationwide infrastructure. Two years isn’t a lot of time, especially with what the RNC does in investing in the ground game. First, it’s raising the resources to be able to put your ground game in place. We had a record post-presidential-election in January—the largest in history for the RNC—we’re continuing to build that finance structure but we’re already putting state directors in place. We have regional political directors in place. We’re continuing to reach our grassroots. We’re working with state parties on messaging. And we’re going to continue to build that operation out into 2018. We’ve hit the ground running. The Democrats are playing catch-up, but they’ve figured out they’ve got to work harder to work with their state parties and build those mechanics—something they neglected in 2016.

Ryan Mahoney, the GOP’s new communications director who took over the position as Sean Spicer left to serve as the Trump White House’s Press Secretary, pointed out during Breitbart News’s interview with McDaniel that somebody should ask the DNC why they have not done an “autopsy report,” like the Republican National Committee did in the wake of the 2012 election.

“I don’t want them to figure out what they did wrong,” McDaniel joked in response. “They really are missing it. I think they’re making a mistake with Gorsuch. I think they’re overplaying it. I’m fine. Keep missing the ball, because they never got it in Michigan. Hillary Clinton never figured it out. People are hurting.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5b42f77d:267f3b2:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Federal funding for one of President Donald Trump’s premier policy proposals may be excluded from the House GOP’s budget for Fiscal Year 2017-2018.

House Democrats, along with a few House Republicans, are working around-the-clock to make sure funding for the estimated $12 billion border wall is not factored into the GOP budget, according to a report by The Hill.

“With Democrats united against new wall funding, it’s unlikely the Republicans have the votes to get it through and prevent a government shutdown,” The Hill report stated.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, in a statement to The Hill, seemed to concede that border wall funding would not be included in the GOP budget, saying the funds would come at a later date.

Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX) and Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ) are the two Republican lawmakers teaming with Democrats to stop the funding of the border wall, despite both representing districts that share a border with Mexico.

“We recognize the need for robust border security and infrastructure to ensure public safety and increase cross border commerce,” Hurd and McSally wrote to the Trump administration in a letter, according to The Hill. “We also have an obligation to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

Establishment Republicans in the Senate, like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), are also teaming with Democrats to stop the border wall, with McCain worrying more about the sentiment that Mexicans have towards America.

“There is a lot of anti-American sentiment in Mexico,” McCain said during a Senate hearing with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly. “If the election were tomorrow in Mexico, you’d probably have a left-wing, anti-American president in Mexico. That can’t be good for America.”

The tone is a shift from his 2010 re-election rhetoric.

Kelly, at the time, agreed with McCain, responding “It would not be good for America, or for Mexico.”

Leading immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration (FAIR) say Trump’s border wall is a “necessity” in the fight against illegal immigration, which has poured into the U.S. for decades, as Breitbart Texas reported.

“A physical barrier on the southern border is a necessity if our government wishes to meet its obligation to protect the sovereignty and security of the United States of America,” FAIR wrote in a report. “Besides helping stem the tide of illegal immigration, it also limits the ability of drug cartels, human traffickers, terrorists and other national security threats to access the United States from Mexico and the rest of Central and South America. Furthermore, a secure border sends the message that prospective immigrants are expected to follow the rule of law.”

House Republicans like Rep. Mike Rodgers (R-AL) have been vocal in their support for Trump’s border wall, proposing legislation with other GOP lawmakers to pay for the wall by taxing illegal immigrants, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Rogers said his legislation is “simple,” saying in a statement that “anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall.”

It has been six months since Andrew Brunson reported to a local police station, hoping he would finally be granted permanent residency in Turkey, a country where he has been a pastor for 23 years.

Instead, he was detained for what authorities falsely claimed was his “membership in an armed terrorist organization.” Despite pleas from his family and the efforts of the Washington D.C.-based Center for Law and Justice, Brunson was transferred to a prison where he is still being held.

“It’s been very hard on us as his family,” Beth Herman, Brunson’s sister, told Breitbart News. “We love him and we want him to be back with his family.”

Brunson’s family has also made direct appeals to the Trump administration. Last month, Brunson sent a statement to President Donald Trump through the United States Embassy in Turkey. And just days ago, his wife Norine met briefly with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during his diplomatic visit to Turkey.

“The 20-minute meeting took place in Ankara, Turkey as the Secretary of State held a series of meetings with senior Turkish officials,” the ACLJ reported. “This meeting occurred just a few days after Pastor Andrew made a direct personal appeal to the Trump Administration to secure his freedom.”

ACLJ posted a statement from Norine Brunson following the meeting:

On Monday, Andrew told me he felt the Lord had said I would meet with Secretary of State Tillerson. On Tuesday, I was told by the embassy and another Senator that the meeting would NOT happen. I decided to come to Ankara anyway and arrived last night. I met with another significant person in the State Department early afternoon, then late afternoon was told the Secretary would meet with me. I just had a 20 min meeting with Sec. of State Tillerson. I do not know what will come of it, considering the sensitive period Turkey is in, but was grateful for the opportunity.

Brunson’s statement asked President Trump to intervene on his behalf.

Will the Turkish government face no consequence for stubbornly continuing to hold an American citizen as a political prisoner? Even though I have a long public track record as a church pastor, they falsely accuse me of being a member of an Islamist terrorist group. I have been imprisoned since October 7, 2016. During this time the Turkish government has produced no proof and has rebuffed numerous attempts by the American government to secure my return to the United States. In fact they are treating the US government with contempt and paying no price for it. I plead with my government – with the Trump Administration – to fight for me. I ask the State Department to impose sanctions. I appeal to President Trump: please help me. Let the Turkish government know that you will not cooperate with them in any way until they release me. Please do not leave me here in prison.

Brunson, an American citizen from North Carolina, has been the pastor of a church in Turkey for more than two decades, and he and his wife raised their children there.

“He loves the Turkish people and he’s tried to do only good to them,” Herman said, adding that her brother would “do nothing that would hurt anybody.”

ACLJ also launched a petition drive, with more than 254,000 people signing on to show support for Brunson and to ask for his release and return to the United States.

“Turkey – our NATO ally – has begun increased crackdowns on Christians,” the petition said. “If convicted, Pastor Andrew could face years in prison based on extremely serious – and false – charges. At the ACLJ, we’re representing the family, mobilizing our international resources – including our offices in the region – demanding Pastor Andrew’s freedom. Take action with us before it’s too late.”

“Pastor Andrew’s plight has caught the attention of hundreds of thousands of people and has been raised directly by the U.S. Secretary of State, and yet he continues to remain unjustly imprisoned and facing trial,” a post said on the ACLJ website.

“We cannot let up our efforts,” the post said. “We need to let Pastor Andrew know, now more than ever, that he has not been forgotten and that our efforts will continue until he is released back to the United States and reunited with his family, who have been unjustly denied their husband and father for far too long.”

ACLJ said that Brunson is being kept in a cell meant to house eight men where more than 20 men are incarcerated.

To date, no official charges have been filed against Brunson, which makes taking legal action difficult, according to ACLJ.

Aysun Akşehirlioğlu, Brunson’s Turkish attorney, said once an indictment is made the case against the pastor would be unsealed and a court date could be set, although nothing is certain, according to the attorney.

Brunson’s sister said that her brother is being persecuted for the faith that is sustaining him.

“We have a strong faith in God,” Herman said. “We believe God is with him and he’ll make it through this.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5aad728e:25be51d:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On April 10 Politico Magazine’s Michael Grunwald suggested President Trump signed repeal of the Social Security gun ban behind closed doors to keep people from noticing the repeal would allow “severely mentally ill” individuals to buy guns.

This is Fake News 101 and it epitomizes the fake news reporting that immediately followed the repeal of the gun ban.

The House voted to repeal the gun ban on February 2 and the Senate followed suit on February 15. Immediately thereafter the New York Times (NYT), New York Daily News (NYDN), and The Huffington Post (HuffPo) all reported the vote to repeal as a GOP effort to help the mentally ill get guns.

On February 28 President Trump signed the repeal of the Social Security gun ban and just over a week later–on March 8–MSBNC’s Greta Van Susteren claimed the repeal would make it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns. She offered a quick overview of the Social Security gun ban then said, “People with mental health issues, identified by Social Security disability benefits, need to undergo stricter scrutiny before they can buy guns.”

Now, approximately six weeks after the fact, Politico Magazine is suggesting Trump signed repeal behind closed doors to keep people from noticing it helps the “severely mentally ill” acquire guns.

Politico Magazine:

The third bill that Trump signed [on February 28], H.J.Res. 40, had more policy significance; it struck down one of President Barack Obama’s regulations and kept one of Trump’s campaign promises. But Trump did not let the media film him signing that one. That’s because the substantive impact of that bill was to make it much easier for severely mentally ill Americans to buy guns, a priority for the National Rifle Association but not for the public. Trump and his fellow Republicans were happy to use an obscure rule-killing mechanism called the Congressional Review Act to undo a popular gun safety regulation that Obama had first proposed after the Sandy Hook massacre, but they didn’t want to call attention to it.

In reality, the repeal of the Social Security gun ban was about repealing an Obama administration gun control that could strip Social Security recipients of their Second Amendment rights without due process. The gun ban worked by singling out beneficiaries who needed help managing their finances and who were also listed under a mental health moniker, whether their mental health problem was something easily treatable and controllable like depression or anxiety or something far more severe like bi-polar disorder or schizophrenia. All were lumped together and any of them–together with a need for help managing finances–could result a loss of Second Amendment rights.

GOP lawmakers and President Trump acted to save the Second Amendment rights of beneficiaries.

The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is laying off staff at their Washington, DC headquarters after the organization spent $61 million on political activities and $19 million on the Fight for $15 movement, according to a new report.

The organization’s recent filings with the Department of Labor revealed that the union spent 61.6 million, 20 percent of its annual budget of $314.6 million on political activities that included support Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential bid, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

Even though the union picked up 15,000 new members in 2016, the new members were not enough to offset the organization’s decline in revenue. That decline has led to staff layoffs at the union’s DC headquarters to make up the difference.

According to the report, the union spent $13 million more on political activities then what they spent in 2014, but $51 million less than what they spent during former President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.

The SEIU, which represents two million employees working in the public sector, service, and health care industries, planned to cut its budget by 30 percent after President Donald Trump won the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, Bloomberg Businessweek reported.

SEIU president Mary Kay Henry called for a shift in the organization’s strategy following the election, branding Trump and the GOP-led Congress as the “far-right.”

“Because the far right will control all three branches of the federal government, we [The SEIU] will face serious threats to the ability of working people to join together in unions,” Henry said in a December 14, 2016 internal memo obtained by Bloomberg.

The SEIU endorsed Clinton for president in November 2015, despite calls from many union members to back Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for his pledge to raise the minimum wage to $15, which Clinton did not fully support.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5a520ecc:22250fa:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Jenny Jarvie of the Los Angeles Times writes that the “Rio Grande Valley is unusually quiet as Southwest border crossings drop to lowest point in at least 17 years.”

From The Los Angeles Times:

Here in the Rio Grande Valley, ground zero since 2014 for the flow of asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution in Central America, the number of families and unaccompanied children caught entering the United States has plummeted, from about 291 a day in January to just 37 a day in March.

Migration experts, Border Patrol agents and advocates offer plenty of reasons for the sharp decline in people crossing over, from President Trump’s aggressive stance on securing the border and media coverage of recent immigration raids to heightened security on Mexico’s southern border. A rise in smuggling fees could also be a factor.

“We don’t really have a normal anymore,” said Castro, who has worked for Customs and Border Protection for nearly 20 years. She insists agents are not doing anything differently; the Trump administration’s executive orders are simply enforcing laws already on the books.

“Are you going to risk a 1,000-mile journey and pay $8,000 to be smuggled if you’re not sure you’ll get to stay?” Castro said, offering a reason she thinks fewer asylum seekers are crossing over. “I wouldn’t.”

The U.S. and Russia have been trading barbs since President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on the Assad regime’s military assets in Syria last week, but now Russian President Vladimir Putin has closed the door on a face-to-face meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when the U.S. top diplomat visits the country later this week.

Russia has long supported Syrian President Bashar Assad and refutes the U.S. claim that the dictator ordered the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed innocent people, including many children.

“We have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the president’s diary,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a Monday press conference call, according to Reuters.

Before Tillerson became Secretary of State, he was the CEO of ExxonMobil, a job that included dealings with the Kremlin. In 2013, Putin presented Tillerson with the Russian Order of Friendship award.

Tillerson is expected to meet with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during his stop in Moscow, according to Reuters.

Reuters reported that Putin regularly met with John Kerry, Secretary of State under Barack Obama.

“Reacting to media reports that Tillerson would use his visit to press Moscow to stop supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia’s closet Middle East ally, Peskov called that a non-starter,” Reuters reported.

“Returning to pseudo-attempts to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that Assad must step down cannot help sort things out,” Peskov said.

Other thorny issues may surface during Tillerson’s visit to Moscow, including Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, its violation of an arms control treaty, and finding common ground on fighting radical Islamic terrorism in Syria.

Tillerson had some tough words for Russia on Thursday about the chemical weapons attack.

Speaking from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where Trump was meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Tillerson cited Russia’s 2013 agreement to oversee the destruction of Syria’s chemical stockpile, saying Russia has “clearly failed in its responsibility” to eliminate those weapons.

“Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,” Tillerson said.

U.S. military officials have said they are certain Assad is responsible for the attack.

“We highly suspect, and in fact, there’s no credible alternative to a Syrian regime air attack as the source of the chemicals that killed so many Syrian civilians,” a military official said.

“ISIS has experimented with mustard agents, blister agents, not nerve agents,” an official said. “But this is well beyond the technical capability of the opposition.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5a37d3f1:2507a1d:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Monday at the White House press briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said he could not “imagine a stable and peaceful Syria” where President Bashar al-Assad remained in power.

Partial transcript as follows:

REPORTER: President Trump has spoken out extensively about the crimes of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Does the President consider Assad a war criminal and does he believe eventually Assad should eventually appear before the ICC?

SPICER: I think right now the focus is twofold. One is defeating ISIS and the second is creating the political environment necessary for the Syrian people to have new leadership there. I don’t think there is — I can’t imagine a stable and peaceful Syria where Bashar al-Assad is in power. I think we all recognize that happens and there can be a multipronged approach. We are ensuring that ISIS is contained and there is a de-escalation of the proliferation of chemical weapons and at the same time creating the environment for a change in leadership.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b59a1e0e2:213fdca:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Democratic Party operatives are planning over 100 ‘tax marches’ across America this Saturday, demanding that Donald Trump release his full tax returns and opposing proposed cuts to federal tax.

“We need a president who works for all Americans, and a tax system that does too. Release your tax returns and commit to a fair tax system for the American people,” a statement from the event’s website reads.

It continues: “President Trump needs to be straight with the American people. To whom does he owe favors? Who are his policies really intended to benefit? Who will he put first? Working families are struggling to make ends meet, but we pay our fair share in taxes – does Donald Trump pay any at all?”

Over 60 left-wing groups, including MoveOn.org, Communications Workers of America, American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Tax Fairness, Indivisible, the Sunlight Foundation, and the Bernie Sanders spin-off group Our Revolution, will participate in the march.

In Washington D.C, participants will begin their rally by the Capitol and move towards Trump International Hotel and the IRS building.

International marches are also planned, with scheduled events in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany and New Zealand.

According to Axios, the timing of the march deliberately coincides with the eight year anniversary of the mass Tea Party rallies, which took place 15th April 2009 to oppose Barack Obama’s $787 billion stimulus package and $3.5 trillion budget.

Last month, progressive MSNBC talk show host Rachel Maddow unveiled a copy of Donald Trump’s tax returns from 2005, which revealed that Trump had paid $38 million in income taxes on $150 million that year.

As part of his plan to reinvigorate small business and stagnant economic growth, Trump has pledged to cut taxes and regulation “massively,” although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned that tax reform is unlikely to be completed before August.

The Trump administration is working on an executive order that could be much broader than the anti-steel dumping measures reported earlier, according to Axios.

Last week, the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump would sign an executive order targeting Chinese dumping into the U.S. soon after the conclusion of China President Xi Jinping state visit in Florida. Under the Obama administration, a preliminary study by the Commerce Department found that China was dumping steel into the U.S. at below market prices.

Back in September, the U.S. International Trade Commission affirmed a decision to impose anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on certain steel imports from Australia, Brazil, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea and Turkey.

The Trump administration recently launched a wide-sweeping investigation into the massive and persistent trade deficits the U.S. runs with so-called “trading partnets” and the unfair trading policies that may be causing them.

Axios describes the potential for an executive order with broader trade sanctions as “explosive,” although it reports that while the plans are “very fluid” and there are internal disagreements about how aggressive the order will be, it likely won’t be confined to steel.

Axios report Jonathan Swan says White House sources have told him:

Steel and aluminum will be targeted.

Other products, including household appliances, could be targeted as well.

If the investigations result in new import duties — as some senior Trump officials believe should happen — it could make some consumer goods more expensive and could hurt the stock prices of American companies that rely on cheap steel imports. A good number of American manufacturing companies, however, could benefit from this hit to their low-cost competitors.

A White House official told Breitbart News that it is likely any executive order to emerge prior to the investigation into trade deficits is completed would be narrowly tailored to commodities and metals such as steel and aluminum and wouldn’t include broader manufactured goods such as appliances.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b59a1e0e2:213fdc8:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

I. The Critics Rave

In case you hadn’t noticed, President Trump has enemies in the Main Stream Media. And the April 6 strike on Syria hasn’t changed that.

On Friday night, MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell speculated that Trump’s decision to order a cruise-missile attack on a Syrian airfield was, in fact, the result of collusion with the Russians.

Yes, that’s right: O’Donnell suggested that Trump and Vladimir Putin worked together to have the United States attack Syria, a Russian ally. The plot supposedly came together in in two steps: First, the Russians would persuade the Syrians to drop poison gas on civilians, and second, the Americans would then fire missiles on the Syrians. And what was the purported point of all this murderous international coordination? Why, to change the subject from the 2016 election-hacking investigation, of course.

O’Donnell admitted that he had no evidence—as in, none, whatsoever—for this accusation, but nevertheless, he insisted, “I raise it without assigning a statistical probability to it, I don’t know what it is. I just know that it’s not zero.”

Virgil wonders: How does O’Donnell know that the probability is not, in fact, precisely zero? Or, to put that question another way, what evidence does O’Donnell have for his allegation? Answer: None. One would think, amidst all the concern about “fake news,” that TV talking heads would be cautious about peddling evidence-free charges.

Moreover, one might further think that NBC, the parent company of MSNBC, would be especially sensitive to fakery. After all, it was just a couple of years ago that NBC suffered the Brian Williams fake-news fiasco, and so the network should be demanding a higher standard of veracity—or at least some standard—from its employees. But then, we should remember that the same disgraced Brian Williams is now an anchor at MSNBC. His show, in fact, comes on just after O’Donnell’s. So much for fighting fakeness.

Or course, the insinuation that Trump is secretly playing footsie with the Russkies is ironic, because one of the MSM’s favorite anti-Trump narratives is that the administration is thoroughly incompetent. And yet all of a sudden, when it suits him, O’Donnell presumes that it has the Machiavellian skill—as well as, of course, the pure evil—to pull this off.

Revealingly, two days later, on April 9, a Washington Post story on O’Donnell’s segment—which conceded that assertion was “evidence-free”—was rated as “Most Read” in the Post. Obviously, MSM audiences are hungering for the most anti-Trump stories they can find.

In the meantime, other MSM outlets, too, are spinning conspiracy theories. In Politico, Philip Gordon, a former Obama National Security Council staffer, asks, “Is Trump Wagging the Dog in Syria?” “Wag the Dog,” of course, was the 1997 movie starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro that spun a tale of an entirely fictional war, conjured up by political consultants, for the electoral benefit of an embattled president.

For his part, Gordon—who not long ago reported to the notorious NSC chief Susan Rice—was happy to mix Hollywood and Washington without any proof:

It is hard to avoid wondering whether the purpose of the strikes was less to defend a red line that Trump had never supported than yet another effort by the president to distract the media’s attention and change the subject from his problems at home. . . . With his popularity falling to unprecedented lows for a new president, and major legislative goals on health care and immigration blocked in Congress or in the courts, it’s not hard to believe that Trump would take a step that would dominate media’s attention, win plaudits from many in his party and some key allies abroad, and might even have some substantive merit.

Virgil has to wonder how such a conspiracy-minded individual got his security clearance—or whether he should ever have it in the future.

Indeed, we can add this bit of sober reality to dog-wagging scenarios. If the Trump administration were looking for a bogus incident somehow to change the subject, Thursday night was not the best time to do it. And why not? Because there was already a lot going on: The Chinese leader Xi Jinping was visiting Mar-a-Lago, and the Senate vote on Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination was taking place the next morning. So a truly doggy diversion could have waited for a slower news day.

Okay, so that takes care of the anti-Trump conspiracy-mongering about the Syria strike—at least until the next conspiracy is mongered.

In the meantime, reacting to the news, others in the MSM were merely skeptical. The New York Times, for example, wondered, “Was Trump’s Syria Strike Illegal?” The newspaper’s answer was that the legalities were “murky and complicated.”

That same day, April 7, Politico was a tad more definitive in its supposition, headlining its piece, “Legality of Trump’s airstrikes disputed.” The article quoted various lawyers and law professors saying, No, probably not legal.

As an aside, Virgil doesn’t recall the same instant spate of legal criticism when Bill Clinton expanded military operations in Somalia—who can forget “Blackhawk Down?” Nor does he recall legal scholars being up in arms over Barack Obama’s many military operations in the Middle East, including the overthrow of an entire government in Libya. (Yes, it’s amazing what a Nobel Peace Prize winner can get away with, while still maintaining his Man of Peace halo.)

Still, much of the MSM commentary on Trump in the wake of the Syria strike was positive, even if it was also sometimes strange in its unexpectedness. For instance, on the morning after the attack, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria declared, “I think Donald Trump became president of the United States.” This is amusing, because in the past, Zakaria has defined Trump in less-than-presidential terms; he has called him a “BS artist,” a “bull[bleeper],” and “a cancer on American democracy.”

A similar turnabout was evident at The Washington Post. Its editorial page, which for two years has made manifest its loathing for Trump, declared on Saturday that the missile strike “was right as a matter of morality,” and added, “it could also yield a host of practical benefits.”

Here we can pause to make a point about the MSM commentariat: Yes, they are almost all Democrats and liberals, and yes, they generally hate Trump. At minimum, they have sought to impugn him, even as many, at maximum, would love to impeach him. Yet at the same time, on foreign policy issues, they are globalist. That is, their instinct is always to “do more.” That is, engage more, spend more—even fight more. Thus the partial pause in the anti-Trump fusillade.

Furthermore, a great many Democratic politicos are on board with that same hard-edged globalist agenda: Former Massachusetts senator and Obama secretary of state John Kerry, to name one, declared himself to be “absolutely supportive” of the Syria strike.

Meanwhile, on the Republican side, some GOPers are even harder-edged in their globalism. These would be the neoconservatives, such as Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Those two, in particular, have been fierce critics of Trump, and yet in the wake of Syria, both swung around, at least for the moment. And as for neoconservative publications, such as The Weekly Standard, the reaction has been ecstatic. Yet we shouldn’t assume that this newfound affection will last very long; as the neocons have made clear, their warm feelings are entirely dependent on Trump’s perceived hawkery.

Of course, elsewhere within the Republican Party, there are contrary voices: Sen. Rand Paul has been a vocal critic of the strike, as has been Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan.

Moreover, among populist-nationalist commentators, the reaction to the strike has been mostly negative, as anyone following the Twitter feeds of, for example, Ann Coulter or Laura Ingraham can readily observe. Indeed, nationwide, there’s deep concern in Trump’s nationalist base.

Yet it’s impossible to reach any conclusion this soon. And in the meantime, former Breitbart News senior national security editor Sebastian Gorka, now a top national-security aide in the White House, was quick to put the Syrian action into context; he told Breitbart London’s Raheem Kassam, on Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM radio, that Syria’s use of gas warfare had forced the American reaction:

The strategic imperative is very clear. These weapons not only are banned; they are being used against civilians. That is a global problem. We have sent a very clear message that when you do something as heinous, as evil, as using weapons of mass destruction against unarmed civilians, you will pay a penalty. That’s why it’s in the U.S. national security interest.

Yet at the same time, Gorka emphasized that the Trump administration knew better than to repeat recent past mistakes: “We are not interested in invading countries and occupying them . . . This is not the second Bush administration.”

II. The Cloudy Future

By Virgil’s reckoning, the last U.S. president who scored a geopolitical success in the Middle East was George H. W. Bush. That success, of course, was the victory of America and its many allies in Operation Desert Storm, the 1991 Gulf War.

Yet interestingly, that geopolitical success overseas failed to translate into political success here at home: In his 1992 re-election campaign, Bush was soundly defeated. The victor that year, of course, was Bill Clinton, who focused on domestic issues, subtly highlighting the incumbent’s over-engagement in foreign affairs.

Since then, through the administrations of three presidents—Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama—it’s hard to think of a single American military initiative in the Middle East and its environs that has gone well. That is, not Somalia, not Afghanistan, not Iraq, not Libya.

So what do these unhappy precedents say about Syria? We can recall that Gorka was keen to emphasize that the Trump administration is not interested in any sort of “nation-building,” and yet even so, war-weary Americans must wonder what’s ahead. It would seem that the answer is still, well, shrouded in fog—although of course, since there isn’t much fog in the arid Middle East, perhaps it’s more fitting to use the Arabic word for sandstorm, haboob.

So, are there are clues to be seen through the haboob?

Virgil has a suggestion: Watch the Congress. That is, on Capitol Hill, we have 535 political experts; no matter what one might think of them, they were all clever enough to get elected. And right now, it’s a safe bet that each one of them is calculating his or her best angle on the question of the Syria strike. Are they for it? Against it? In between? Or nowhere to be found?

So watching where lawmakers line up, over time, will reveal much about whether the betting wisdom thinks that Trump policy in the Middle East is headed north—or south.

What we know for sure is that today, for the most part, legislators are playing their cards close to their chest. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, has been focused on the Gorsuch confirmation and little else—and perhaps he likes it that way.

Of course, legislators, if they’re interested, have a safe harbor: The Constitution.

In Article One, Section Eight, the language is explicit: It’s Congress that has the sole power to “declare war.”

One leading constitutionalist, of course, is Sen. Mike Lee of Utah; it was no surprise that he cited that foundational document when he declared, in the wake of the attack:

Anytime we send our young men and women into harm’s way, the President owes it to the American people to come to Congress and present a plan. The Constitution says that in order to declare war, you have to go to Congress and get approval. We want to hear the president’s plan and have the ability to debate it.

Indeed, even lawmakers not known for their constitutional fidelity are saying much the same thing; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, too, wants a Congressional debate. In fact, she’s even calling for an immediate special session of the House, despite the fact that Congress is currently away on Easter recess.

Of course, as everyone knows, presidents in recent decades have been loath to ask Congress for a formal declaration of war—the last such request came from Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941.

Why this subsequent presidential reluctance? Perhaps because commanders-in-chief have been in a hurry, or perhaps because they weren’t sure that they’d be successful if they asked Congress—or perhaps they just didn’t want to be bothered.

Instead, for some of them, their preferred vehicle has been a lesser approval, such as the vaguely worded Tonkin Gulf Resolution of 1964, which got us into Vietnam And sometimes, they sought no approval whatsoever—they just did it.

Interestingly, oftentimes, Members of Congress are okay with a president doing as he wishes on foreign military matters. That is, many lawmakers know a sticky wicket when they see one, and so they are happy not to be asked to pick a side, yea or nay. That is, if Congress isn’t consulted, then Members are free to position and re-position themselves on questions of conflict, according to the inevitably changing fortunes of war.

We might observe that it was way back in 2001, just days after 9-11, that Congress voted an Authorization of the Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF). That AUMF, which enabled operations in Afghanistan, is now nearly 16 years old. And yet it has been used to underwrite military action just about anywhere and everywhere.

Yet here’s a loophole, through which many sitting lawmakers are happy to stride right through: Roughly three-fourths of today’s representatives and senators were not in Congress back in 2002, and so, of course, they never voted on the AUMF, pro or con. Thus they have complete latitude as to what to say about military action; their fingerprints are nowhere to be found.

And one thing lawmakers do know is that casting a vote on war can have political consequences—dire political consequences. We might recall that back in October 2002, George W. Bush asked Congress to authorize the use of force against Iraq. Among the Democratic senators who voted for that authorization were John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, and that aye vote came back to bite both of them.

Kerry, of course, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, and yet, because of his pro-war vote, even as Iraq was looking distinctly Mission: Not Accomplished, he was unable to capitalize on anti-war sentiment when he ran against Bush. And in the 2008 Democratic primaries, the pro-war Clinton was ambushed from the left by an anti-war insurgent from Illinois.

Virgil has no idea where the Syria issue is headed. And yet the U.S. Constitution, plus political experience, both say the same thing: Wherever Trump goes, he should seek to bring Congress with him.

By contrast, if he proceeds without Congress, then lawmakers are free to peel off anytime, in reaction to the latest headline. (And if the news is good, they can jump on the bandwagon; there’s nothing in the Constitution against opportunism.)

Yet as we have learned, in war, times can get tough. Thus for the 45th president, as with any president, the go-it-alone road could prove to be a lonely road, indeed.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b59a1e0e2:213fdc7:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was previously financially aided by the George Soros-financed MoveOn.org to win his Congressional seat.

Schiff was also awarded the Toll Fellowship, which is sponsored by the Council of State Governments, a nonprofit that monitors federal government activities and is heavily financed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations.

The Open Society and Soros-funded groups have additionally supported a number of Schiff’s legislative efforts.

Schiff has been helping to lead the Democrats’ unsubstantiated charges of alleged collusion between President Donald Trump and Moscow.

Last month, Schiff delivered the opening statements at a Congressional hearing where he laid out the case for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. This reporter previously documented serious problems with Schiff’s charges, which include wild conspiracy theories and heavy reliance on a questionable source.

In largely forgotten history, Schiff’s 2000 Congressional campaign against Republican incumbent Jim Rogan was openly aided by MoveOn.org.

On January 1, 2000, the Wall Street Journal reported on the radical group’s fundraising efforts for Schiff. The Congressional seat was particularly important since Rogan had gained fame after he was selected to be one of thirteen House Managers in the 1998 impeachment case of Bill Clinton. Rogan was supportive of Clinton’s impeachment and became a hero in the Republican Party.

The Journal reported:

If MoveOn were to achieve its ambitious goals, it just might have a big impact on this year’s struggle to control Congress, especially the House. Republicans hold only a slim five-vote majority there, and the outcome will “likely be determined in no more than three dozen congressional districts,” says Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. And of course, most congressional impeachment proponents were Republicans. One of the most prominent among them, House impeachment manager James Rogan of California, faces a challenge this year from Democratic State Senator Adam Schiff, for whom MoveOn to date has raised $106,000, Mr. Boyd says.

CNN reported on the MoveOn.org money for Schiff’s 2000 campaign: “By 2000, MoveOn.org was raising $2 million for Democratic candidates, including more than $100,000 to help California’s Adam Schiff beat Congressman James Rogan, one of the House managers during Clinton’s impeachment trial.”

MoveOn.org also sponsored a January 2010 rally in favor of health care reform outside Schiff’s office in Pasadena, California.

Schiff’s 2000 campaign bio, meanwhile, relates that he was “awarded the prestigious Toll Fellowship, sponsored by The Council of State Governments.”

The bio continues:

Nominated and endorsed by his peers in the Legislature, Schiff was selected from many outstanding applicants across the nation by a committee of state elected and appointed officials as one of the most promising new leaders of state government. In 1998, the California League of High Schools named Schiff Legislator of the Year.

Schiff later said that the Toll Fellowship “helped me identify my own leadership strengths, work more effectively with my colleagues and strengthen my relationship with the media.”

The Council of State Governments, which sponsors the Toll Fellowship, is heavily financed by Soros. The Open Society provided the group with $320,000 in 2003; $1 million in 2004; and another $100,000 that year alone.

In 2009, Schiff introduced the Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act. The bill was described by the Justice Center at the Soros-funded Council of State Governments – which gave Schiff the Toll Fellowship award – as providing “grants to state and local governments to design and advance data-driven, consensus-based strategies to reduce corrections spending and increase public safety.”

A press release from the Council of State Governments said that Schiff’s bill “builds on the justice reinvestment work done by the Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center in Texas, Kansas, Vermont, Rhode Island and seven other states.”

The Justice Center’s justice reinvestment initiative was itself directly supported by Soros’s Open Society, the press release documents.

In 2014, the Open Society released a statement publicly supporting legislation by Schiff “requiring the president to provide an annual public report on the total number of persons killed or injured in drone strikes.” The Open Society further signed a joint statement with other leftwing groups, including organizations financed by Soros, supporting Schiff’s Targeted Lethal Force Transparency Act.

During an interview on a weekly podcast called “The Global Politico,” NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell said while she was not sure if President Donald Trump was “confused” or intentionally lying, she was sure people in his administration are flat out lying.

Mitchell said, “That does not concern me as much as the behavior of the president and his aides and the press secretary to ignore facts. It starts at the top. And the most obvious example is the March 4 tweet saying that President Obama wiretapped him at Trump Tower. There is no way of getting around that. It is just not factually correct. Director Comey said it wasn’t; Senator McConnell said it wasn’t; Speaker Ryan said it wasn’t true, yet the president and his advisors and the press secretary seem to be twisting themselves in knots to try to explain and justify that.”

On President Trump, she continued, “I’ve avoided using the word lie because I don’t know his motivation. I don’t know if he is confused. I don’t know what he is being told.”

But Mitchell was not as generous toward the staff, saying,“I have never seen anything like this, where people just flat out lie. I’m not talking about the president now, but people you know, black is white and white is black, and they mislead you. It’s really disconcerting to see the podium in the White House briefing room being used to mislead or misdirect or obfuscate.”

WASHINGTON—Justice Neil Gorsuch gave brief remarks from the Rose Garden at the White House on Monday after taking his oath of office as the newest justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Immediately before administering the oath, Justice Anthony Kennedy spoke. He explained that Gorsuch had already taken one oath on Saturday, the oath to support and defend the Constitution, which is the same oath that every officer in all three branches of the government take (except the president, who takes a unique oath to the Constitution, specified in Article II of the Constitution).

But there is also a second oath that all federal judges must take. Kennedy explained this second oath, the one he was about to administer to Gorsuch during the ceremony. “Both of these oaths remind us that we as a people are bound together,” Kennedy said. “We as a people find our self-definition, our respect, our heritage, and our destiny in the Constitution.”

After being sworn in, Justice Gorsuch thanked his family, his former colleagues from the Tenth Circuit, President Donald Trump, and staff from the White House, Vice President Mike Pence’s team, and the Senate.

“To my new colleagues and the staff of the Supreme Court, thank you for the very warm welcome,” he continued. “I look forward to many happy years together.”

Gorsuch also thanked the Scalia family, adding with a voice full of emotion, “I won’t ever forget that the seat I inherit today is that of a very, very great man.”

Turning his attention to the American people, Justice Gorsuch quoted from the Gospel of Luke in the Bible that he is mindful that “to whom much is given, much will be expected.”

He concluded with a vow to the American people, “I promise you that I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great nation.”

President Donald Trump already appears to be getting results after his visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

According to the Financial Times, China signaled that they are open to ending an import ban on American beef.

They also signaled their willingness to buy other agricultural products, demonstrating a commitment to balancing the enormous trade deficit with the United States.

The two countries are focusing on a 100-day effort to signal mutual trust on issues of trade, part of Trump’s commitment to voters during the election.

After meeting with Chinese officials at Mar-a-lago last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared optimistic that a number of quick deals could be reached.

“We focused specifically on a more balanced economic relationship, specifically on trade,” he told reporters after the meeting. “And we focused on the desire to have very specific action items, both in the short term for the next time we get together, as well as what the goals are over the year.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b58aac7bb:227d537:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

LUCCA, Italy (AP) — The Latest on Group of Seven meeting of foreign ministers from industrialized nations (all times local):

5:00 p.m.

Group of Seven foreign ministers are sitting down in Italy for their first roundtable session at a meeting dominated by Syria’s civil war and Russia’s role in it.

Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano greeted U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the other G-7 diplomats as they arrived Monday at the centuries-old Ducal Palace in the Tuscan city of Lucca.

The foreign ministers of Italy, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and Canada then sat around a table to begin their talks.

Tillerson is due to travel to Moscow after the two-day G-7 meeting, and the group hopes to send a unified message that Russia must end its support for Syrian President Bashar Assad in the wake of a deadly chemical weapons attack last week.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says the group will discuss imposing new sanctions on Syrian military figures and Russian military individuals responsible for backing them.

3:20 p.m.

British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says Group of Seven foreign ministers are considering imposing new sanctions on Russian individuals over Moscow’s support for Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Johnson says ministers meeting in Lucca, Italy on Monday and Tuesday “will be discussing the possibility of further sanctions, certainly, on some of the Syrian military figures and indeed on some of the Russian military figures.”

The G-7 foreign ministers are discussing their response to last week’s chemical attack in Syria, which the West blames on Assad’s forces – and by extension its Russian backers.

Britain has been among those calling most strongly for a tough new approach to Russia.

8:23 a.m.

Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations are gathering for a meeting given urgency by the chemical attack in Syria and the U.S. military response.

The meeting in the Tuscan walled city of Lucca that starts Monday aims to pressure Russia to end its support for President Bashar Assad.

Last week’s nerve gas attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people stirred President Donald Trump to strike for the first time at Assad’s forces.

Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano says Europe’s broad support for the U.S. military strikes contributed to a “renewed harmony” between the United States and its partners.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is attending the first meeting of G-7 foreign ministers since Donald Trump took office.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b58975f68:226eb25:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. government has dropped its request for Twitter to produce records that could identify users behind an account opposed to President Donald Trump, the company said Friday.

As a result, Twitter is withdrawing a federal lawsuit that challenged the government’s request. On Thursday, Twitter charged that efforts by the government to “unmask” the people behind the account violated the First Amendment.

“The speed with which the government buckled shows just how blatantly unconstitutional its demand was in the first place,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Esha Bhandari said in a statement. Bhandari represents the unidentified person or people behind the Twitter account.

ALT-FIGHT

The account in question is @ALT-uscis, a reference to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office. In the two months of its existence, the account has been critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. The account described its users to The Associated Press in February as employees and former employees of the agency.

The account is one of dozens of rogue Twitter accounts that have sprung up since Trump took office, purporting to represent current or former federal employees at various agencies who oppose the administration’s policies. Other such “alternative” – or “alt” – accounts include @Alt-CDC for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and @AltUSEPA for the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the immigration agency and was named as a defendant in Twitter’s lawsuit, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

ANONYMOUS RIGHTS

In an interview, Bhandari said the rights of anonymous speakers were at risk if the government could demand information on their identities without any legal justification. She noted that the government’s summons to Twitter had boilerplate language but lacked a specific reason for wanting to know the identities.

She said she hoped the swift withdrawal would deter other federal agencies that might target users of similar “alt” accounts.

“It really shows what a high standard the government has to meet,” she said.

In its lawsuit, Twitter claimed the government cannot compel the company to disclose users’ identities without first meeting several tests. It must prove that a criminal or civil offense has been committed, that it’s not asking for information with the intent of suppressing free speech, and that the interests of the investigation outweigh the First Amendment rights of Twitter and its users, Twitter said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b58975f68:226eb24:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Neil Gorsuch was sworn in as the 113th justice of the Supreme Court of the United States just after 11am Monday at the White House’s Rose Garden.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, under whom Gorsuch clerked upon graduating law school more than two decades ago, administered the oath of office to now-Justice Gorsuch, until now a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Gorsuch’s ascendance will give the Supreme Court its full compliment of nine justices for the first time since Justice Antonin Scalia, a pole of the Court’s conservative wing, passed away last February.

In attendance were President Donald Trump, other top administration officials, and all eight sitting justices of the Supreme Court. Monday’s swearing-in comes after a protracted confirmation fight that saw both the first threatened partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee and a resort to the “constitutional option” of changing Senate rules to prohibit such filibusters. The administration’s triumph in that fight came as a major boost to morale, fulfilling a campaign promise to deliver Justice Scalia’s seat to a conservative jurist.

The president addressed the assembled crowd at the Rose Garden before the swearing-in. Alluding to the confirmation fight, he thanked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for their efforts to bring Gorsuch to this day.

The president also referenced Scalia’s legacy, which Gorsuch now is poised to defend, nodding to the late justice’s widow, Maureen, who was also in attendance. “The Ceremony has special meaning as Justice Gorsuch is filling the seat of one of the greatest Supreme Court judges in American history, and that’s Antonin Scalia,” he said.

Justice Gorsuch replied in his own address, assuring the crowd that that legacy was safe. “I won’t ever forget that the seat I inherit today is that of a very, very great man,” he said. Gorsuch also promised to be a “faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great nation.”

Gorsuch will join his fellow justices on the bench for oral arguments when the Supreme Court reconvenes from its recess April 17. His presence on the immensely powerful Court may have an immediate impact on the Trump administration’s agenda. Appeals against lower-court injunctions barring Trump’s travel ban executive orders, for example, are moving through the Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits. It is possible the Supreme Court, now including Justice Gorsuch, will consolidate and hear the administration’s appeals to these injunctions on an expedited basis this spring.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5889ff41:1f722b3:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Monday on Laura Ingraham’s nationally syndicated radio show, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan discussed the possibility of the United States escalating its involvement in the Syrian civil war days after President Donald Trump launched a military strike on a Syrian airbase in responding to the Syrian government’s alleged use of chemical weapons.

Buchanan noted the biggest cheerleaders of Trump’s action were Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Marco Rubio (R-FL), which he deemed to be “the war party.” However, argued that they would not “get the war they want” from Trump.

“It’s McCain and Graham and Marco Rubio — the war party,” Buchanan said. “But let me say this, Laura — my view is they’re not going to get the war they want. If Donald Trump the president takes us into Syria’s civil war and he’s already made the first strike — it will consume his presidency. And the sense I get this morning and listening to some of these folks on yesterday’s show is that, ‘Don’t worry, this is just a one-off. We’re not going into Syria. The enemy is still ISIS, as indeed it is if you take a look at what happened in Egypt yesterday, 47 dead and 100 injured.”

“So I think the war party is going to be frustrated because I cannot believe that Donald Trump on second thought is going to plunge us into Syria, which he told us again and again and again would be an act of folly — that our enemy is ISIS and our enemy is al-Qaeda and that we should finish them off,” he added. “Then we’re necessarily going to have to work with the folks who did most of the heavy lifting in finishing them off.”

The Times of Israel reports: WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump will host a White House Passover seder Monday night, an administration official told The Times of Israel on Sunday, confirming that the new administration will continue a tradition started by former president Barack Obama.

Aside from the president, who is expected to attend, it is not yet clear which members of the administration will participate in the dinner, including Trump’s Jewish son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. The White House Seder began as an annual tradition under former president Barack Obama, who hosted the first such event in 2009, in the Old Family Dining Room.

News that the Trump administration had planned to carry on the custom was first reported by Jewish Insider. Obama sought to establish this ritual after he participated in a Passover dinner during his successful 2008 presidential campaign, when he surprised Jewish members of his campaign staff by holding an impromptu seder in a hotel ballroom in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

NBC News launched the latest in a series of failed attempts to link Dr. Sebastian Gorka — the philosemitic, pro-Israel deputy foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump — to the neo-Nazi far-right on Saturday.

As with all such previous attempts, NBC found nothing to prove any extremist ideas or views on the part of Dr. Gorka. And as with all such previous slanders, NBC relied on fraud — this time, in the form of the phony “Anne Frank Center.”

The full name of the bogus front organization is the “Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect” — an ironic title, given that it is a full-throated Democratic Party attack machine that shows no respect for anyone else whatsover.

The self-described “civil rights activist” who leads it, Steven Goldstein, is an LGBT activist who has beclowned himself on cable news over the past few months in his efforts to tarnish President Trump as the second coming of Adolf Hitler.

Breitbart Jerusalem editor Aaron Klein exposed Goldstein and his organization in February. Goldstein is no Holocaust expert: he is merely an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter who found a ready audience for his political schtick among a gullible press corps eager for ammunition in their war against the White House. He has no qualms about exploiting the name and memory of Anne Frank for his purely partisan purposes. It is Holocaust desecration, if not outright denial.

Among many embarrassing moments for Goldstein and the Anne Frank Center, none was worse than last month’s revelation that the barrage of antisemitic bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers had been carried out by a black liberal journalist and a Jewish teenager in Israel. Rather than apologize for vomiting forth false accusations of hatred against the White House, Goldstein, reacting to the news, still managed to blame the Trump administration.

And yet it is the Anne Frank Center to which NBC News, lacking any other proof for its baseless claims, turned for help in condemning Gorka.

Goldstein’s operation did not disappoint: “How many ducks in the Trump White House must walk, talk and quack Anti-Semitically before our country wakes up and sees the greater problem?” the Center said in a statement to NBC. Never mind that all such accusations are entirely without merit: Goldstein &amp; Co. repeat the lies.

The rest of the NBC News report was devoted to collecting statements from Hungarian villagers who claim to recall Gorka’s father’s membership in, and Gorka’s sympathy for, a version of the Vitezi Rend order that was anticommunist and had nothing to do with the Second World War organization of the same name.

NBC News was forced to admit that after sending investigative journalists halfway around the world, it was “unable to confirm” Gorka’s membership.

Cue the Anne Frank Center, there to add its emotive name and bilious innuendo to the heap of false accusations.

Yet as Bruce Abramson and Jeff Ballabon noted at the Jerusalem Post last month, the Gorka family protected Jews during the Second World War. Gorka senior went on to fight Soviet communism — which, notably, suppressed the Jewish faith and encouraged anti-Israel fanaticism. For that, he was awarded, in exile, the Vitezi Rend medal his son wore in tribute.

Dr. Gorka, a former Breitbart News editor, worked for this company for years — under the management of Jews, alongside many Jewish colleagues, and with favorable views toward the Jewish community and the Jewish state. It is clear that liberal media outlets like NBC and left-wing fronts like the bogus “Anne Frank Center” are just attacking him as a way to undermine Trump.

Their partisanship is obvious; they could, at least, make the fraud a little less obvious.

The fashion industry’s trade association is joining with Mark Zuckerberg’s lobbying group on Monday to argue that employers need more visas to hire more foreign professionals for high-fashion jobs in New York City that young American graduates supposedly just won’t do.

But the leading designers at the Council of Fashion Designers of America are already using many foreign professionals instead of American fashion school graduates, according to federal data about the inflow of foreign contract-workers. For example, the 22 fashion leaders on the CFDA’s board have asked for enough visas to import 406 H-1B contract workers since 2013, according to federal data at the MyVisaJobs.com website.

Michael Kors has asked for 39 H-1B visas to import foreign contract workers since 2013, according to the website. Tory Burch asked for 30 contract workers, Ralph Lauren asked for 138 contract workers, J. Crew asked for 106 contract workers, and Calvin Klein sought 37 foreign workers, all to take desirable U.S-based jobs sought by young American professionals.

The H-1B visas allow the fashion companies to get employees at the cheapest rate allowed by the federal government. For example, companies asked for visas to hire foreign workers for jobs such as a New York 2015 “fashion designer” at $80,000 per year, a 2013 “technical designer” in New York for $50,000 per year, and a 2016 “associate designer” at $67,200 in nearby Jersey City. Many of the jobs are for related fashion industry careers, such as an “associate CAD designer” in New York to be paid $75,000 in 2016. Less famous fashion companies say they will pay foreigners below $50,000 in 2016 in high-cost New York, says the MyVisaJobs.com site.

Nine of the fashion leaders on the 22-person CFDA board have apparently not asked for the foreign workers. These include the companies owned by Tommy Hilfiger, Vera Wang, Ashley Olson, Kara Ross, Reed Krakoff, Norma Kamali, and Mimi So.

The fashion group at the CFDA and Zuckerberg’s FWD.us are holding a press conference Monday morning where they will argue that:

Immigration challenges are increasingly slowing the innovation that fuels the fashion industry, particularly as fashion houses compete for designers, scientists, researchers, and textile specialists to develop wearables and smart textiles. The fashion industry thrives on the talents of … designers, models, seamstresses, tailors, and garment workers.

Already, Zuckerberg’s Facebook company and its many software subcontractors and business allies hire many foreign H-1bs workers in place of Americans. By law, companies are not required to interview Americans before they hire H-1B contract workers for jobs in the United States, but they are required to declare they cannot find Americans to do the various jobs, such as New York fashion designer.

In 2013 and 2014, Zuckerberg’s FWD.us strongly pushed the unpopular “Gang of Eight” legislation that would have doubled cheap-labor immigration into the United States for at least ten years. Currently, the federal government provides work permits to roughly 1 million legal immigrants and roughly 1 million contract workers each year, even as 4 million young Americans join the workforce.

To bring in visa workers, designers including Michael Kors and Phillip Lim have hired the well-connected outsourcing law firm, Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen &amp; Loewy LLP, as Breitbart Texas reported. Fragomen has previously helped outsource hundreds of American jobs to foreign workers for Carnival Corporation and Viacom.

The fashion industry will also use the Monday press conference to ask for more cheap blue-collar labor to fill out their garment workshops; “The fashion industry thrives on … seamstresses, tailors, and garment workers [and] roughly 20% of workers in clothing manufacturing are undocumented immigrants,” said the April 6 joint press release from the CFDA and Zuckerberg’s lobbying group, FWD.US.

The screen shots below show the number of H-1B visas requested by the fashion leaders since 2013. The data is provided by the MyVisaJobs.com, which collates federal H-1B data.

Roughly a third of those visa requests are successful because so many other companies are asking for a limited number new H-1B visas.

The federal government hands out 85,000 H-1B visas each year but allows each new contract-worker to get repeated visa extensions. Those extensions can keep H-1Bs in the United States for many years.

Moreover, some of the H-1B workers eventually get a bonus payment from the federal government in the form of green cards which allow them to become citizens. This promise of a government-provided citizenship bonus creates a huge incentive for foreign professionals to work at salary levels far below the salary levels needed by Americans, many of whom have large college debts to pay. In turn, the inflow of foreign professionals also lowers the salaries paid to American graduates in many other industries.

This year, Goldman Sachs estimated the total population of H-1B workers holding jobs in the United States is almost 1 million.

Non-profits are allowed to get as many H-1B s as they wish. For example, since 2013 New York University has asked for roughly 400 new H-1B contract workers to take jobs as assistant professors, adjunct instructors, scientists and postdoctoral researchers, according to MyVisaJobs.com.

Nationwide, most of the H-1B contract workers have jobs in the computer industry, where they reduce wages and spike company profits. But a growing number of the H-1B workers are being hired by companies seeking to lower salaries now being paid to American doctors and physical therapists, business graduates, industrial designers, architects and fashion professionals.

For example, Condé Nast, which is the mass media parent company for fashion magazines like American Vogue, Vanity Fair and Glamour Magazine, has been hiring foreign workers instead of American since at least 2013. In 2015, Condé Nast tried to outsource lower-level jobs that newly-graduated fashion students usually fill, such as a fashion writing job for Glamour Magazine, which they sought to outsource for a $45,000 salary. Since 2014, Condé Nast has sought to outsource 30 non-technical fashion industry jobs to foreign workers rather than hiring talent in America.

President Donald Trump has promised to reform the H-1B program, but he’s facing intense industry pushback from business groups and Wall Street because every dollar spent on salaries is one dollar less of profit. This month, however, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has warned companies that it is illegal to discriminate against Americans when they’re asking for H-1B visas.

In general, Democratic politicians, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, support the H-1B program because it gives them a bargaining chip in disputes over immigration policy. In 2013 and 2014, Democrats promised more H-1Bs to business in exchange for business’ promise to pressure GOP legislators to support an amnesty for the 11 million illegal aliens living in the United States.

Here are the screenshots for the fashion leaders who have asked for H-1B visas to import contract workers for jobs sought by American professionals:

The New York fashion establishment’s close ties to the open borders lobby will be on full display during an upcoming joint press conference calling for the continued flow of low-skilled legal immigration.

The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), represented by Chairwoman Diane Von Furstenberg and President Steven Kolb, will join Mark Zuckerberg’s open borders lobbying group FWD.us’ President Todd Schulte to “share findings from a new white paper about the impact of immigration policy on the United States’ fashion industry, and its ability to create jobs for American workers,” according to a news release on the coming event.

“Immigration challenges are increasingly slowing the innovation that fuels the fashion industry, particularly as fashion houses compete for designers, scientists, researchers and textile specialists to develop wearables and smart textiles,” the CFDA news release claims. “The fashion industry thrives on the talents of individuals from around the world, including designers, models, seamstresses, tailors and garment workers. Roughly 20% of workers in clothing manufacturing are undocumented immigrants.”

Though the press conference will tout jobs for American workers in the fashion industry, the event will be a clear depiction of the New York fashion establishment’s growing friendship with the open borders lobby and top immigration law firms.

Most notably, CFDA Vice Chairman Michael Kors, primarily known for his all-American style cashmere knits and luxury handbags, is one of the largest American luxury brands that uses the H-1B foreign guest worker visa to outsource American jobs to foreign workers.

Since 2013, Michael Kors USA Inc. has steadily increased its requests for H-1B workers. The company applied for at least 56 foreign workers between Fiscal Years 2014 and 2016, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department.

Like other H-1B employers in the fashion industry, Michael Kors uses the foreign worker visa to fill jobs dealing with human resources, e-commerce, writing and fashion merchandise.

When Breitbart Texas reviewed the salaries for these positions with immigration expert John Miano, a multitude of the jobs requested the foreign worker fill the role for less pay than what the mean wage for that position would be paid if the worker were American.

For instance, in 2016 Michael Kors requested an H-1B visa for a foreign worker to fill an ‘Associated E-Commerce Front End Developer’ job. The so-called “prevailing wage” for that job was listed at $61,797.

Nonetheless, the prevailing wage touted by H-1B employers is generally the lowest possible salary for any job, Miano told Breitbart Texas.

The mean wage for the e-commerce job is $104,936, which adds up to a more than $19,500 in savings for Michael Kors by hiring a foreign worker rather than an American.

Likewise, Michael Kors requested an H-1B visa for a junior digital designer and a junior copywriter in 2016, each paying less than the mean wage paid to an American worker doing the same job. The junior digital designer job was offered to an H-1B foreign worker at $45,000, despite the mean wage for the job being over $66,000 a year.

In the case of the junior copywriter job, employers paid the H-1B foreign worker a $55,000 per year salary. But, the job’s mean wage is well over $80,000 a year — saving the fashion brand about $30,000 by outsourcing the job to a foreign worker instead of hiring an American.

To request H-1B foreign workers, Michael Kors hired Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen &amp; Loewy LLP, the leading open borders law firm that regularly lobbies for increased legal immigration levels and higher numbers of foreign guest workers entering the U.S. who take jobs from American workers.

Other American designers like Ralph Lauren, who famously dressed First Lady Melania Trump for her husband’s Presidential Inauguration, and designer Alexander Wang requested H-1B foreign guest workers over Americans since at least 2013.

Phillip Lim, known for his luxury clothes and accessories in the 3.1 Phillip Lim brand, hired Fragomen to help him apply for at least 23 H-1B foreign guest worker visas between Fiscal Year 2014-2016. Lim is a member of the CFDA, winning awards for his accessory designs and womenswear.

Fragomen’s work for the open borders lobby has long been reported on by Breitbart News, noting how Fragomen helped the Carnival Corporation and Viacom replace hundreds of American workers with cheaper, foreign replacements through the H-1B visa.

Miano, who worked closely with conservative columnist Michelle Malkin on research exposing the H-1B foreign guest worker visa, told Breitbart Texas how Fragomen was partially responsible for Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fl) ‘Gang of Eight’ amnesty legislation in 2013.

In 2015, Malkin chronicled Rubio’s relationship to Fragomen, writing “Rubio hired Enrique Gonzalez, a Democratic donor and partner with the global-immigration-law firm, Fragomen Del Rey, to be his chief adviser on the [Gang of Eight] bill.”

Like Zuckerberg, Fragomen has successfully crafted and structured a network of open borders organizations including the Council for Global Immigration, according to Miano.

Coincidentally, Fragomen regularly promotes Zuckerberg’s FWD.us, featuring the open borders group in a panel discussion about the impact of President Donald Trump’s executive orders on immigration.

Since its creation, FWD.us and Zuckerberg have been called out specifically by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, with the longtime immigration critic saying in 2014 “Well, the masters of the universe are very fond of open borders as long as these open borders don’t extend to their aggregated compounds and fenced-off estates,” as Breitbart News reported.

Multinational trade agreements and globalization devastated fashion manufacturing production in the U.S.

Over the past two decades, fashion manufacturing jobs in the U.S. have declined by more than 80 percent, dropping from about 900,000 jobs in 1990 to just 150,000 jobs in 2011, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.

Just two years after the federal government enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), companies laid off a total of 706 American workers from fashion manufacturing jobs in the U.S., with 67,511 workers initially filing for unemployment. Between 1996 and 2011, companies laid off an average of 323 American workers every year in the fashion manufacturing industry.

In that same period, American workers in textile mills suffered an average of 200 layoffs per year. In 1996, some 1,040 American workers in the clothing, textile, and leather manufacturing industry were fired from their jobs

Trump has not only criticized the importation of foreign workers to replace American workers; he has particularly blasted NAFTA, saying it has led to ruinous times for America’s once-thriving blue collar workers. The new President signed an executive order officially terminating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which he argued would further strip jobs from U.S. workers and outsource them to foreign nations.

Despite this, Trump has yet to make any reforms to the H-1B visa or other foreign guest worker visas, as Breitbart Texas reported.

President Donald Trump has picked an economic advisor who believes in growing the nation’s economy by importing workers and consumers, and by expanding free-trade outsourcing, despite Trump’s “buy American, hire American” campaign promises.

Kevin Hassett is slated to become chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors if he is approved by the Senate’s banking committee. If Hassett is confirmed, that will be a win for the corporatist, business-first faction in Trump’s White House, which fights for influence in the Oval Office against the populist, America-first faction that helped Trump win the election in November.

The Axios news site used three bullet points to describe what the views held by Hassett, formerly an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.

China: Hassett warned in 2010 that bashing China-U.S. trade policy would bring the U.S. back to the downward spiral in the 1930s. Globalization: “An absolute prerequisite for long-term economic growth is full participation in the global economy and trading system.” Immigrant workers: [E]conomic growth could expand significantly if immigration in the U.S. were expanded.”

The Financial Times said Hassett’s pick shows “nationalist forces have lost some ground when it comes to the economic advice reaching the president.” The Financial Times, in fact, used Hassett’s words to reveal his stance on issues.

• America Needs more workers … With lackluster GDP growth threatening to become our new normal, allowing more immigrants to enter for the sake of employment is one of the few policies that might restore our old normal. If the U.S. doubled its total immigration and prioritized bringing in new workers, it could add more than half a percentage point a year to expected GDP growth. • Understanding the role of the United States in the global economy Liberalized trade — in broadly multilateral, regional, or bilateral agreements — is a key ingredient in the recipe for prosperity. … An absolute prerequisite for long-term economic growth is full participation in the global economy and trading system. • Analysis of the economic effects of immigration reform … This paper explores the economic consequences of expanded immigration on the U.S. economy. It begins by reviewing the immigration practices of our OECD trading partners, and documenting that immigration, as a share of the work force, is well below international norms. The literature identifying the economic impact of immigration is reviewed, suggesting that economic growth could expand significantly if immigration in the U.S. were expanded.

That’s a standard pitch from D.C.-based legislators, agency officials, and political advisors, all who stand to gain from a more powerful national economy and a greater inflow of taxes — no matter how immigration changes the distribution of income or the hurts the prospects of ordinary Americans and their children.

Breitbart News reported last year about a study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine:

“Deep in the report, but not in the press release, it shows how each new unskilled immigrant costs state and local taxpayers $1,600 per year. It shows how the annual cost of legal and illegal immigration to state and local taxpayer is at least $57 billion, and that each unskilled immigrant is a net loss to taxpayers for the next 75 years.”

The same study also showed how cheap-labor immigration cuts salaries and shifts wealth towards investors and company owners:

The jargon-filled, much-caveated, 495-page report does show the information needed to measure how legal and illegal immigration transfers $500 billion a year from the wages paid to working-Americans towards companies, Wall Street investors and to new immigrants. But the report does not provide a dollar figure for the ‘immigration tax.’

Immigration also provides companies with a huge new source of consumers, many of whom rely on welfare payments. For example, immigrants now comprise one-in-seven Americans, sharply increasing annual sales by retail stores, groceries, entertainment companies, and much else.

The inflow of cheap unskilled labor also slows U.S. companies’ investment in the labor-saving technology that would actually increase the average wealth of poor and rich Americans by increasing their productivity. That process is making Americans companies vulnerable to foreign companies that use robots and other machines to increase their workers’ productivity, to lower their production costs and increase their marketplace competitiveness.

But immigration makes the federal government more powerful, so the selection of pro-immigration Hassett is being cheered by D.C.- advocates, including his predecessor, Jason Furman, who chaired the CEA under former President Barack Obama.

Kevin Hassett is an excellent pick. He is serious about substance, committed to dialogue, &amp; knows how to navigate DC. I wish him good luck. — Jason Furman (@jasonfurman) April 7, 2017

Michael Strain, Hassett’s colleague at the AEI, also praised the pick. “Kevin is a fantastic choice for CEA chair,” Strain wrote. “He is a first-class economist. He understands economics research, holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania, and has a distinguished record of peer-reviewed academic papers. His deep knowledge of economics and of the economics literature will enable him to give truly expert advice to the president and to others in the Trump administration.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b55a3c1d7:1dd7b13:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) placed a risky re-election bet last week with two conflicting votes in the battle over Judge Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.

Heitkamp is one of the most vulnerable of the 23 Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018.

Elected in 2012 with a one-percent margin of victory, Heitkamp will face a conservative electorate that gave the state’s three electoral college votes to Donald Trump in November with an overwhelming 64 percent to 28 percent win over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Heitkamp, who had been rumored to be under consideration as President Trump’s pick for Secretary of Agriculture, tried to place both sides against the middle in the two critical votes in the Gorsuch nomination fight.

On Thursday, she joined all 47 of her Democratic colleagues in opposing the Republican procedural move to limit the time the Democrats could filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination.

The move, which was the most important vote cast for any Senator in the confirmation battle, passed on a 52-48 party line vote. Had it failed, Republicans would have needed 60 votes to end the Democratic filibuster.

On Friday, Heitkamp joined two other Democratic senators up for re-election next year in states Trump won in November, Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) in voting yes to confirm Gorsuch.

Gorsuch was confirmed in a 55-44 vote in the Senate.

Heitkamp’s half-in, half-out strategy is in stark contrast to Sen. John Tester (D-MT), another Democratic senator up for re-election in a state President Trump won by a 56 percent to 36 percent margin, a resounding 20 percent victory, but not as overwhelming as his 36 percent margin in North Dakota.

Tester, the crew cut hardcore progressive from neighboring Montana, aggressively opposed Gorsuch’s nomination at every level, voting against both the procedural move to end the Democratic filibuster on Thursday and the actual confirmation of Gorsuch on Friday.

On the face of it, Tester’s strategy appears to be riskier than Heitkamp’s given Gorsuch’s sterling legal reputation, the strong recommendation by the American Bar Association, and the widespread praise he received for his measured responses given at his Senate confirmation hearings.

But Heitkamp’s double moves may have been too clever by half, and Tester appears to be betting that far left ideologues will come to his aid with such overwhelming financial and political support he can hold off the expected conservative counterattack in Montana.

The influential conservative/libertarian North Dakota blog SayAnything explains why Heitkamp’s strategy may backfire in North Dakota.

“North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp likes to make a big to-do over being a pragmatic sort of elected leader with an eye towards cooperative governing and bipartisanship. A cynic might say that carefully maintained facade is the work of a skilled politician who knows what sort of character she must play to get elected. And Heitkamp, the only Democrat elected on the statewide ballot in North Dakota since 2008, plays it well,” SayAnything Blog editor Rob Port notes:

During her first campaign for the Senate in 2012 then-candidate Heitkamp railed against the filibuster. On her still-active campaign website Heitkamp said there are “too many extreme politicians in Washington” who hold the country “hostage to advance their narrow political agenda.” Then, during her first year in office in 2013, Heitkamp voted with the Democratic majority at the time to eliminate the judicial filibuster. Three Democratic lawmakers broke ranks with their party on the issue, but Heitkamp wasn’t one of them. When Democrats lost their majority in the Senate, though, Heitkamp found an appreciation for the filibuster. She voted for a lot of them to obstruct Republican policies.

But, Port argues, what worked for Heitkamp in previous North Dakota elections may not work in 2018:

“Fast forward to today, Republicans held a vote to nuke the filibuster rule to clear the path for President Donald Trump’s first appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court,” Port wrote on Thursday:

Voting against the rule change to keep the filibuster in place? Senator Heidi Heitkamp. She has announced that she’s supporting Trump’s nominee, and she is voting that way so far, but she also voted to help Democrats keep the filibuster in place. To be fair, Senator John Hoeven also flip flopped on judicial filibusters. He voted against change the rules back in 2013, and voted for changing the rules today. But the politics around Heitkamp’s flip-flop are a little different. Whereas Senator Hoeven’s political appeal in our state is built on the fact that he’s exactly the sort of moderate Republican most voters want, Heitkamp is playing at being a Democrat who governs like a moderate Republican.

“Heitkamp told voters in 2012 that she was against the filibuster, and voted to end it when President Barack Obama was trying to push his judicial appointments through. But then when Republicans attained the majority she helped deploy filibusters to block their policy agenda, and now today voted against ending the filibuster for President Trump’s judicial appointment,” Port adds.

“It seems as though Heitkamp’s stance on the filibuster has far less to do with principle than it does partisan politics,” Port concludes.

That approach may work in blue states like New York and California. But in a very red state like North Dakota, it will be a much harder sell for Heitkamp in 2018.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5589e908:1db9cc3:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Sunday on CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS,” host Fareed Zakaria said although questions remained about President Donald Trump and his policies and what will come in the long term after the United States’ strike against an airbase in Syria, he congratulated Trump for attack because he called it “a blow against evil.”

Transcript as follows:

There is much to applaud in President Trump’s decision to attack the Assad regime this week. It punished a regime that has engaged in war crimes against its own people. It upheld an international norm against chemical weapons. It ended Trump’s strange flirtation with Vladimir Putin on the Middle East. And, most significantly, it seems to reflect a belated recognition from Donald Trump that he cannot simply put America first — that the president of the United States must act on behalf of broader interests and ideals. Trump, as candidate and as president, had so far avoided the language of global norms and international order. Yet in explaining his actions Thursday night, he invoked both and ended his remarks with a prayer that Barack Obama would never have dared to make: “God bless America — and the entire world.”

But as former Defense Secretary William Cohen pointed out Friday, “One strike doesn’t make a strategy.” U.S. policy on Syria remains quite unclear. The Trump administration had repeatedly announced that it had shifted away from the Obama administration’s calls for regime change in Syria. In fact, Trump had indicated that he was happy to leave the country to Assad as long as this would help defeat ISIS. On Tuesday, the day of the attack on Idlib, White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated it. The missile strike appears to have reversed that policy.

If so, it is a major shift and raises important questions: Is the United States now engaged in the Syrian civil war? Will it use military force to help oust Assad? Do these actions help the ISIS and al-Qaeda — which are fighting against the regime? And what happens next in the overall war against the Islamic State?

Many of America’s allies have expressed support for the strike. But in an increasingly complex global system, these countries look to the United States for a consistent strategy that can be relied upon over time. Trump’s foreign policy seems to change with every meeting, event or crisis.

Trump does not deny his changes of mind. In fact, he embraces them as a virtue, describing himself as — flexible. “I’m proud of that flexibility,” Trump said this week, adding that he also likes to be unpredictable. But there is a difference between unpredictability and incoherence. This week’s strike does leave one with the impression that foreign policy in the Trump administration is not being made by carefully consistently evaluating a situation, assessing various options, weighing costs and benefits, and choosing a path. Instead, it is a collection of reflexes responding instinctively to the crisis at hand.

Trump’s military advisers provided him with a tactically brilliant option — a small air base, whose destruction would produce fairly little physical or diplomatic fallout. But the strike will have minimal impact on the balance of power. Assad will remain in place, as will his opposition. If anything, the strike might embolden some opposition forces to fight on rather than surrender, and the bloodshed will actually intensify. The long-term prospects for peace in Syria remain gloomy.

But, no matter the complications, in the short term the president struck a blow against evil, for which I congratulate him. And if he was moved to this action because he saw heart-rending pictures of children, that’s fine. I would only ask that he look again at those images. Perhaps they would move him not simply to drop bombs, but also to provide more aid to these war-torn people. Perhaps they would even move him to let some of those people escape their misery and find a home in America.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b55558659:1d7a276:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

As U.S. warships head to the western Pacific Ocean to establish a presence near the Korean Peninsula, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is preparing to chair a meeting at the United Nations later this month focused on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, Voice of America reported.

The strike team, dubbed Carl Vinson, includes an aircraft carrier and will make its way from Singapore towards the Korean Peninsula, Aljazeera reported on Sunday.

The move is in response to the Communist regime’s “reckless, irresponsible” recent missile tests, a U.S. Navy official said.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told reporters last week that Tillerson will oversee the April 28 meeting of the United Nations Security Council. The U.S. has chairmanship of the council for the month of April.

The meeting comes after President Donald Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida last week where discussions surely included North Korea and China’s unwillingness so far to press North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un to stop his provocative actions.

“I think the United States has seen China for 25-plus years say that they are concerned about North Korea, but we haven’t seen them act like they are concerned about North Korea,” Haley said. “I think this administration wants to see them act, and I think they are going to pressure them to do that,” Haley said.

In an interview with London’s Financial Times, Trump said that if China is not going to solve the problem of North Korea, “we will,” VOA reported.

“China has a great influence over North Korea,” Trump said. ”And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won’t … and if they don’t, it won’t be good for anyone.”

North Korea’s foreign ministry warned last month that its government is prepared to go to war with the United States, following Tillerson saying that the U.S. is prepared for military engagement with North Korea if any of our allies are attacked.

“The U.S. should face up to the situation of the world with its eyes wide open. The DPRK has the will and capability to fully respond to any war the U.S. would like to ignite,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying, according to the South Korean newswire service Yonhap.

“If the businessmen-turned-U.S.-authorities thought that they would frighten the DPRK, they would soon know that their method would not work on the latter,” the spokesman continued. “The world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won by the DPRK in the recent ground jet test of Korean-style high-thrust engine will carry.”

“Expert satellite imagery analysis suggests [North Korea] could well be preparing for a sixth [missile launch], with U.S. intelligence officials warning that North Korea could be less than two years away from developing a nuclear warhead that could reach the continental U.S.,” Aljazeera reported.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b54fa4789:1d0bae7:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON – The Pentagon on Friday laid out its case for why it believes the Syrian regime conducted the April 4 chemical weapons attack, which led to President Trump ordering a cruise missile strike against a Syrian military airbase.

The strike was the first time the U.S. has purposely targeted the Syrian government since the 2011 civil war broke out there.

The strike has major implications for the U.S.’s involvement in the war, which President Obama sought to avoid. It raises the question of what else Trump may do, particularly if the Syrian regime continues to target civilians and opposition rebels. It has also angered Russia, whose government Trump has said he wanted to improve relations with.

Senior U.S. military officials are suggesting that Russia may have played a role in the chemical weapons attack which, if proven, would raise the question of what the U.S. would do in response.

The potential for more war in Syria is troubling for Trump’s political base, many of whom believe that the U.S. should not get entangled in foreign wars.

Two senior U.S. military officials speaking to reporters on background at the Pentagon laid out the justification for the strike against the Syrian regime, which saw two U.S. destroyers launch 59 Tomahawk missiles at a military airbase in Al-Shayrat in western Syria.

They said they believe the Syrian regime conducted the April 4 chemical weapons attack in Khan Sheikhoun, a small city in Idlib province, because they were at risk of losing an important airfield to the Syrian opposition in neighboring Hama province.

“We think that this attack is linked to a battlefield desperation decision to stop the opposition from seizing those key regime elements,” one official said.

The military officials pointed to two recent alleged chemical weapons attacks in Hama, which involved chlorine and an unidentified nerve agent on March 25 and March 30.

“This escalated on 4 April to use of chemical weapons material,” the official said.

Officials also said they tracked a Syrian regime aircraft, likely an SU-22, flying from the Shayrat airbase to Khan Sheikhoun on the day and time of the attack, showing reporters a graphic of the tracked flight.

“We know the routes these aircraft took. We know that these aircraft were overhead at the time of the attack,” one official said.

They disputed Russian reports that the munition struck a rebel chemical weapons facility, showing pictures of a crater in the middle of a street where they say the chemical weapon landed.

They said the crater showed staining around it that was a telltale sign of a chemical munition.

They also said munition fragments suggest it was a type of weapon not aimed to create heavy damage, another sign it was meant to distribute chemicals.

“We highly suspect, and in fact, there’s no credible alternative to a Syrian regime air attack as the source of the chemicals that killed so many Syrian civilians,” the official said.

“There’s no credible opposition capability with nerve agents,” they added. “ISIS has experimented with mustard agents, blister agents, not nerve agents. But this is well beyond the technical capability of the opposition.”

The officials said they “suspect” the Syrian regime had help — pointing the finger at the Russians, who they say share the base with the Syrians and “obviously” would have known every flight operation that comes out of the airfield.

At the time of the strikes, there were anywhere between 12 to 100 Russian personnel at the base, including a helicopter squadron and support crew.

“We think we have a good picture of who supported them as well. Obviously, at a minimum, the Russians failed to rein in the Syrian regime activity. And, again, the continued killing of innocent Syrian civilians,” the official said. “We know the Russians have chemical expertise in the country. We cannot talk about — openly — any complicity between the Russians and the Syrian regime in this case. But we’re carefully assessing any information that would implicate the Russians knew or assisted with the Syrian capability.”

However, it remains unclear whether the Russians had a direct role in the chemical weapons attack.

One official said that, shortly after it was launched, a small drone of unknown nationality flew over the hospital where patients were being taken to. It left and returned five hours later, when a fixed-wing aircraft — also of unknown nationality — struck the hospital.

“We don’t know why somebody — who struck that. We don’t have positive accountability yet, but the fact that somebody would strike the hospital, potentially to hide the evidence of a chemical attack, about five hours after — it was clearly seen that it was a hospital with ambulances and civilian traffic — is a question that we’re very interested in,” the official said.

But officials clarified that they had “no knowledge of Russian involvement in the attack.”

“But we will investigate any information that might lead us in that direction,” one official said.

The senior U.S. military officials said they went out of their way to not hit Russian facilities, troops, or equipment at the base, and that they knew where they were located on the base and took care not to strike in those areas.

Officials said they hit an estimated twenty aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and fuel storage sights, and a surface-to-air missile system — targets that will make the airbase inoperable. Targeting the runways, which are easy to fix, would not have been worth the missile, they said.

The officials said the decision to strike came down from Trump at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday — just four hours before missiles began to fly.

The Russians were notified once of the oncoming strike, they said, through a military channel they use to make sure there are no accidents between their forces in Syria.

The officials said it was “implied” that the Russians will tell the Syrians at the base, and that it was “quite possible” aircraft could have slipped out, but that they did not see any leave, nor did they see any response from Russian air defenses.

The officials said there were “multiple” military options the President was given to choose from, and the strike was the “proportional response” to the chemical weapons attack.

The strike could possibly save “hundreds of civilians, probably thousands” from future chemical weapons attacks, one official said.

“We had to create a deterrent for that behavior,” the official said.

The military is conducting a thorough battle damage assessment to account for all the damage, which would likely include any civilian casualties. Syrian government media have claimed there were nine casualties, including four children, but the U.S. military officials say they have no evidence of that yet.

So far, Russia has also reacted with anger, declaring that it will cut a channel between U.S. and Russian forces in Syria meant to make sure accidents between them do not happen.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b54fa4789:1d0bae6:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while discussing the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) warned against a president being able “to start a war or launch missiles when they want” and declared there has to be “congressional approval.”

Kaine said, “As you know I’m a strong supporter that the U.S. should take action to protect humanitarian causes like the ban on chemical weapons. So I voted for a limited strike to do exactly the same thing. A limited strike for that purpose, for the humanitarian purpose, is something that I would likely support if there was a plan. But where a — I differ, and I took the same position with President Obama We are a nation you’re not supposed to start a war without a plan that is brought to you by Congress. That makes us different from any nation in the world. The drafters of the Constitution said you have to put a check against an executive gone wild. They have not presented a plan to Congress and asked for approval. That’s what they have got to do.”

He continued, “I was a Senate candidate in 2011 when President Obama joined military action against Libya. Humanitarian purposes. I agreed with the Republicans in the house that rebuked President Obama and said he exceeded his authority because the U.S. Was not under eminent threat. That is the only circumstance they can use article two power. You heard Lindsey Graham just say that was not the case and President Trump did not say the U.S. was under eminent threat. We had a briefing on Friday and they presented us with no plan. We don’t know if it is limited or if there is more. When we asked about the legal authorization, they said they were not prepared to discuss that but they will in the coming days. We don’t want a president, any president, to just be able to start a war or launch missiles when they want. There has to be congressional approval.”

He added, “If Assad is doing things wrong, violating international treaties with an authorization we can try to deter him from doing it, prosecute him for war crimes, but I don’t think we should say we’re going to try to change your leader. I don’t think it should be official U.S. policy.”

Michael Savage spoke out forcefully against intervention in Syria and aggression towards Russia during both Thursday’s and Friday’s monologue segments of the Michael Savage Show.

Savage asked Thursday, “who got to you, Mr. President? Who is whispering in your ear and could have made you make this dramatic of a change towards Russia in just three days?” On Friday he condemned the strikes, saying “we just helped ISIS.”

Although his Thursday remarks were broadcast before the United States attacked a Syrian airbase, Savage warned against military action that would raise tensions with Russia, saying, “Do you want war with Russia, all of you idiots, all of you fools who are pounding the war drums?” Savage compared President Trump to President Woodrow Wilson, noting that Thursday was the 100-year anniversary of Wilson asking for a declaration of war on Germany. According to Savage, “Like Trump, Woodrow Wilson ran on an ‘America first’ platform. He was elected largely because he kept us out of the war in Europe. But someone got to him, too.”

In Savage’s opinion, it is “the generals” who are leading President Trump into military conflicts. At the same time, be believes key advisers are being pushed away from Trump’s team. Savage pointed to both Jeff Sessions and Representative Devin Nunes (R-CA) removing themselves from inquiries into Russia, and also mentioned former Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon, saying “the generals have gotten to him and turned him from peace with Russia. And the people standing in the way of war, like Steve Bannon, are being shown the door.”

Savage rebuked President Trump on Friday, sarcastically calling the strike a “military tweet.” He later expanded that thought, saying it was “a limp-wristed attack in order to gain the attention of the fools in the media and the fools amongst the so-called republican voters who think this was a real great military action.” He criticized not only the President but also members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who applauded the strikes, exclaiming, “You know you’re on the wrong side if that cesspool of filth supports your actions.”

Michael Savage believes Thursday’s strike was a poor decision by President Trump that is out of line with the goals of his campaign and the desires of those who voted for him. Savage asked, “how is is this an ‘America first’ decision?” He added that Syrian intervention wouldn’t create a single job and is a no-win situation for America, likely to turn into another quagmire.

He also used his monologue to lay out a case that the poison gas attack may not be what it seems. According to Savage, “This was a complete false flag event… Assad had nothing to gain by gassing his own people.” He believes the symptoms witnessed in Syria are consistent with a phosgene gas, not the sarin gas widely reported. He stated “the West jumped to a conclusion,” and later added, “we just helped ISIS.”

Michael Savage refers to himself as a “conservative peacenik.” He may have titled his latest book Trump’s War, but that was in no way a reference to military intervention in Syria. Savage cited his book at several points on Friday to discuss the groups now cheering the President’s actions, including establishment Republicans and the mainstream media.

Savage’s Thursday and Friday broadcasts clearly demonstrate that he is not an apologist for the Trump administration. He is proving a point made in Trump’s War as highlighted in our review of the book — in which he says “I will continue to do my job as a member of the fourth estate: to be a thorn in the government’s side, even Donald Trump’s government, if it goes off course.”

Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said the administration of President Donald Trump was “probably was partially to blame,” for the deadly chemical weapons attack in Syria.

McCain referred to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson comments in March that “the longer-term status” of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will be decided by the Syrian people, McCain said, “I think it probably was partially to blame. And Secretary Tillerson is basically saying the same thing after kind of contradicting himself and then saying the same thing argues vigorously for a plan and a strategy. As I said, again, taking this action, I support and was important. But we have got to have a strategy and a plan to follow through.”

“Just a one-time deal is not going to be productive,” he continued. “And saying we are only going after chemical weapons areas ignores the enormity of the problem. A very small percentage of the people have been slaughtered in Syria have been slaughtered by chemical weapons. It has been done by barrel bombs and indiscriminate killing and all of the other war crimes that have been committed.”

On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” host Chris Wallace questioned President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster about what he called the administration’s “mixed signals” on Syria.

Wallace asserted that UN Ambassador Nikki Haley is calling for regime change in Syria while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is saying the main priority is eliminating ISIS.

McMaster said, “Well both Secretary Tillerson and Ambassador Haley are right about this. What we need to do, and what everyone who’s involved needs to do is to do everything they can to resolve this civil war, to halt this humanitarian catastrophe, this political catastrophe, not only in Syria but the catastrophe is affecting the greater Middle East, it’s affecting Europe and it’s a threat to the American people as well. So to do that, what’s required is some kind of a political solution to that very complex problem. And what Ambassador Haley pointed out is it’s very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation from the Assad regime.”

“We’re not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change,” he continued. “What we’re saying is other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves, ‘What are we doing here? Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population and using the most heinous weapons available?’ So I think that while people are really anxious to find inconsistencies in those statements they are in fact very consistent.”

Sunday ABC’s “This Week,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said Mexico will not pay for President Donald Trump’s proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Rubio said, “We met with the foreign minister and it did come up in our meeting. Let me just say, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall. By the way, America should, if we believe it’s in our national interests to do so but I do think there is a lot we can work on with Mexico. I think the Mexican government is open, for example, to renegotiating key points of NAFTA, on intellectual property as an example.”

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while discussing President Donald Trump’s missile strike on a Syrian air base, New York Times columnist David Brooks said Trump is like “Dory in Finding Nemo, that he did one thing and it will have no consequences.”

Brooks said, “We are debating him like this is like Winston Churchill in the world of war like he is making some big strategic decision. I’m afraid it’s Dory in ‘Finding Nemo,’ that he did one thing and it will have no consequences. That there was no strategic thinking behind it. There is no big strategic shift. I do think the one promising thing is that we’re never going to be in the business of regime change anytime soon. But we should be in the business of defending some basic norms of civilization.”

“A hundred years ago the U.S. entered World War I, thousands were gassed to death, so at least we can be against gassing. So in that sense, this action was a useful action, We should be in the business of making sure that when people fight they behave with some basic level of human decency. So we at least had a little thing in this but I’m not sure it was a big shift in any way.”

Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, famed as a staunch gay rights advocate and a champion of progressive causes, has been accused of sexually molesting several teenaged boys 30 years ago, reports have revealed.

A trio of men came forward to allege that Murray had sex with them decades ago when they were underage. At least one said he was 15 when the mayor molested him back in the 1980s, according to the Seattle Times.

A man identified only as “D.H.”, now 46, filed a lawsuit against the 61-year-old Murray alleging that the famed mayor and activist began molesting him when he was only 15 and exacerbated problems he had during his life starting when he was a teen. He also claims that Murray was fully aware of his underage status.

D.H. claims that he has been “dealing with this for over 30 years,” and filed the lawsuit as part of the “healing process.” The accuser said he hoped the lawsuit would help him to repair his mental issues after years of “the shame, the embarrassment, the guilt, the humiliation that I put myself through and that he put me through.”

The plaintiff also alleged that he took money from Murray for the sexual encounters up to 50 times over a four or five year period.

After the lawsuit had been made public, Murray issued a press release calling the accusations false:

These false accusations are intended to damage a prominent elected official who has been a defender of vulnerable populations for decades. It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline. These unsubstantiated assertions, dating back three decades, are categorically false. Mayor Murray has never engaged in an inappropriate relationship with any minor. … Mayor Murray will vigorously fight these allegations in court.

Murray also pledged to continue his bid for re-election as the city’s Mayor.

The Seattle mayor has been the subject of such allegations in the past, with one case going as far back as 1984. Jeff Simpson came forward decades ago alleging that he met Murray in a Portland center for troubled children and was later molested for an extended period by the man who would become mayor.

A police investigation was launched in the 80s, but no charges were ever filed.

“I don’t necessarily think that he destroyed my life,” Simpson said about his experience, “But I believe a lot of the problems I have stemmed from this.”

Simpson’s story was buttressed by Lloyd Anderson, another man who claims to have been molested by Murray back in the 1980s.

“Look, the guy took advantage of my situation,” Anderson said of his experience in the 1980s. “I was young, I was homeless and doing drugs and everything.”

Mayor Murray characterized some of the allegations as a “right-wing” attack on his career.

“The two older accusations were promoted by extreme right-wing anti-gay activists in the midst of the marriage equality campaign, and were thoroughly investigated and dismissed by both law enforcement authorities and the media,” he said in a statement.

Murray insists that these lawsuits and allegations are politically motivated.

The mayor has a long history of fighting for progressive causes. When he was in the state legislature, for instance, he led the fight for the state to recognize gay marriage. And once elected Seattle’s mayor, Murray launched a campaign to push the city’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. Murray has also been a leading opponent of President Donald Trump favoring efforts to torpedo the president’s immigration policies.

PARIS (AP) — A political party that would abolish same-sex marriage – one whose founder wanted AIDS patients rounded up and branded homosexuality “a biological and social anomaly” – is now winning LGBT votes in France.

Motivated in part by the deadly Islamic extremist attacks at home and at a Florida gay nightclub, a growing bloc of traditionally left-leaning gay voters has embraced French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, leader of the once-fringe National Front party.

“Faced with the current threats, particularly from radical Islam, gays have realized they’ll be the first victims of these barbarians, and only Marine is proposing radical solutions,” said Kelvin Hopper, 25, a gay artist who lives in a hipster district of Paris and plans to cast his ballot for Le Pen.

While nobody knows how far Le Pen’s supporters will carry her in the April 23-May 7 vote, several years of polls have shown the National Front is now more popular with the LGBT voters who make up 6.5 percent of the French electorate than it is with straight voters.

That the constituency once reviled by the party is buoying it suggests populism has taken root in France more deeply than previously thought.

The embrace goes both ways.

Since taking over the National Front in 2011, Le Pen has worked to soften the racist, homophobic reputation of the party co-founded by her father who was twice-prosecuted for Holocaust denial.

Surrounding herself with gay advisers, a strategy known as “pinkwashing,” has been a key part of these efforts that have put her within striking distance of the presidential Elysee.

Jean-Marie Le Pen, 88, once declared “there are no queens” in the National Front and, in a sulfurous assault on the gay community in the 1980s, compared AIDS-sufferers to lepers whom he advocated keeping in isolation centers.

To “de-demonize” the party and give it wider appeal, his daughter publicly shunned him. In a stark irony of history, Marine Le Pen’s National Front has more top aides who are publicly known to be gay than any other French political party.

The unusual distinction prompted commentators to give Le Pen the epithet “Pink Marine.”

The most prominent of the party’s gay operatives is her No. 2, Vice-President Florian Philippot. He came out after being unwittingly photographed by a gossip magazine on a private weekend away in Vienna with a man in 2014.

The mass shooting at the Pulse gay club in Orlando, Florida, in June also boosted Le Pen’s standing with LGBT voters.

Shortly after recordings emerged in which the U.S.-born attacker who killed 49 people pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, Le Pen declared “how much homosexuality is attacked in countries that live under the Islamist jackboot.”

Although some critics have accused her of opportunism, the rebranding work has paid off.

French polling firm IFOP says its surveys show a “constant progression of the National Front among the gay electorate” since Marine Le Pen took over. At 16.5 percent, the proportion of gay, lesbian and bisexual people supporting the party last fall was 2 percentage points higher than its share of straight voters, according to the firm’s research.

“There is a large risk that the Orlando killing exacerbates an anti-Muslim sentiment among sexual minorities, all the more so because they have shown for several years to be more and more responsive to the security and anti-immigrant discourse of the National Front,” the study says.

Surprisingly, research of voting patterns also shows that one-third of gays who wed after France legalized same-sex marriage in 2013 voted for National Front candidates in the 2015 regional elections – even though the party would scrap the marriage equality law.

Courting LGBT voters, “pinkwashing” the far-right, has been a delicate dance for Le Pen.

She was noticeably absent from divisive nationwide protests against the same-sex marriage law introduced by the Socialist government of outgoing President Francois Hollande.

Yet she can’t afford to alienate the party’s old guard as she tries to broaden its base. Buried in her election manifesto is a pledge to abolish gay marriage, a position aimed at appeasing the National Front’s conservative flank.

National Front Chief Campaign Strategist Sebastien Chenu, who is the most open about his sexual orientation among the party’s gay top officials, disagreed that the plan was homophobic during an interview with The Associated Press.

In its place, Chenu explained, would be a bolstered civil unions law providing same-sex couples with “the same duties, the same obligations” as marriage, he said.

Chenu agrees that the National Front has seen a spike in support because of fear from the extremist attacks France has endured in recent years. The number of gay men in prominent positions within the party is a much less significant factor, he said.

“Those who want to fight against freedoms are Islamic radicals,” Chenu said. “They put bombs in gay night clubs in the United States. So obviously, it creates an anxiety for a certain number of gays.”

France is not the only place where right wing rhetoric conflating Islam with radical jihad has been used to shake up long-standing political alliances.

In the Netherlands, Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders said that his party, which is hostile to Muslims and wants to halt immigration, should hold natural appeal for LGBT voters.

“We were always one of the top parties that were supported by (the gay) community. We believe that like Christians and Jews and women and journalists, gay people are also one of the first to pay the price of … Islamization,” Wilders said.

In the United States, President Donald Trump, too, has used rhetoric expressing solidarity with gays as a means of attacking some Muslim-majority countries – claiming during the presidential debates last year that they “push gays off of buildings.”

The lurch to the right by LGBT voters – called homonationalism – deeply shocks those who see the nationalist sentiments sweeping Europe as a threat that could erode hard-fought freedoms, not protect them.

“It is true that terror attacks and religious extremists brought huge publicity to Marine Le Pen. And she profits from this. She profits from people’s fear,” Yannick Fredefon, a gay Paris resident, said.

One factor that explains the new wave of LGBT support is that many Le Pen voters are millennials like Hopper who are too young to remember the National Front’s neo-fascist roots or the acid anti-gay sentiments openly expressed by her father.

Others, especially gay men, are in awe of the blond, blue-eyed, 48-year-old former lawyer’s persona – they see an audacious, strong-willed woman writing the rules in a world of men.

If elected, Le Pen would be France’s first female president.

“Marine is a strong, combative, honest woman,” Hopper said.

Experts say the wooing strategy works best on gay people who see the fight for equality as over and no longer feel obligated to support the liberal politicians who traditionally defend their rights.

“Having recently acquired the right to marry and adopt children, an important part of the gay electorate is turning to the extreme right because they do not need to support the left anymore on these issues,” IFOP pollster Francois Kraus said.

But gay rights groups in France warn against complacency.

“The simple idea of reversing (the marriage equality) law is in itself a homophobic act as it is to want discrimination again,” said Clemence Zamora Cruz, a spokeswoman for Inter-LGBT, a coalition of French LGBT rights groups.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b53466566:1b0dd9f:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while discussing the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to a deadly chemical attack, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called President Donald Trump’s decision one of his “finest hours.”

Haley said, “What happened this week was really one of the president’s finest hours.”

She continued, “He wanted to know exactly what the facts and evidence was. He wanted to know what the options were, what the risks were, and the political strategy and solution side of it. After all of that, he made a very, you know, strong decision and I think it was one that was very good for the world.”

She added, “He won’t stop here “If he needs to do more, he’ll do more. Really, now what happens depends on how everyone responds to what happened in Syria and make sure that we start moving toward a political solution and we start finding peace in that area.”

Fox News Channel host Jeanine Pirro praised President Donald Trump for the Syria strike Saturday in her opening statement on Fox News Channel’s “Justice.”

Pirro said Trump’s “swift, certain and decisive leadership” is something that has been missing for a long time in the United States.

“When President Donald Trump ordered a targeted strike on that military base in Syria, he demonstrated swift, certain and decisive leadership absent for so long in America,” Judge Jeanine began.

She continued, “His clarity, determination and compassion for the most weak among us without the accustomed indifference, whimpering, dithering, vacillating moral equivalency of the other guy reflects not only his courage, strength and honor, but finally the resurgence and the reawakening of America the great. This is what we voted for.”

Alec Baldwin pulled double duty this week on “Saturday Night Live,” playing the role of Fox News Channel’s Bill O’Reilly and President Donald Trump in the same skit.

The skit first lampooned O’Reilly over his sexual harassment charges, then “O’Reilly” thanked “Trump” for defending him.

“I deeply appreciate your support on behalf of all women and I’d like to thank you, Donald Trump, for promoting sexual assault month,” Baldwin as O’Reilly said.

“That’s right, Bill,” Baldwin as Trump replied. “It’s a subject near and dear to my hand.”

Sunday on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said while he supports President Donald Trump’s missile strikes on a Syrian airfield in response to a chemical attack, it was not enough because Syrian jets are taking off from the base less than 36 hours after the attack.

McCain said, “Now that they are flying again basically within 36 hours is not a good signal.”

He recommended “cratering the runways.”

Former UN Ambassador and National Security Council member Samantha Power has been silent on Twitter since President Donald Trump’s decision to attack a Syrian air base Thursday in response to Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons attack against civilians last Tuesday.

Power wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book on genocide, in which she criticized past U.S. presidents for inaction — then did nothing as the carnage unfolded in Syria on President Barack Obama’s watch.

Power’s inaction was legendary — first as chair of President Obama’s so-called “Atrocities Prevention Board,” then as UN Ambassador. Breitbart News was among the first to call for her resignation from the administration, in 2013; the Wall Street Journal followed in 2016, with a scathing editorial blasting her for being a bystander to genocide in Syria.

Since leaving office in January, Power has been a frequent critic of President Trump, his staff, and his foreign policy. On Wednesday, she called the story about former Obama administration official Susan Rice “unmasking” members of the opposition a “scam.” Last month, she gave credence to conspiracy theories about Russian efforts to help Trump win the 2016 election.

On Tuesday, Power specifically criticized President Trump on Syria, implying that he was indirectly responsible for the chemical weapons attack:

Backed by Russia&amp;Iran, declared permanent by Trump, Assad regime in #Syria feels safe to do what it wants. Gassing people is what it wants. — Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) April 5, 2017

She did later retweet an article about Trump condemning the attack.

However, she has not reacted to Trump’s military move.

Other Obama administration staffers have been vocal in their opposition to Trump’s decision — perhaps, as HotAir.com’s John Sexton observes, because it exposes the lie that Syria’s chemical weapons had been dealt with, and presents a sharp contrast to the former president’s passivity.

At least one former Obama administration official praised President Trump: Anne-Marie Slaughter praised the move against Assad, telling Politico: “The years of hypocrisy just hurt us all.”

(AP) MOSCOW – Russia reacted to U.S. military strikes on its ally Syria Friday by cutting a hotline intended to prevent midair incidents, a response that demonstrates Moscow’s readiness to defy Washington and could even put the two nuclear superpowers on a course toward military confrontation.

President Vladimir Putin signaled he was ready to risk a clash with the U.S. and abandon hopes for mending ties with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, rather than accept the humiliation of standing by while his ally is bombed.

Russia’s decision to suspend the hotline established after the launch of the Russian air campaign in Syria in September 2015 effectively means that Russian and U.S. planes could fly dangerously close to each other during combat missions, raising the risk of inadvertent or deliberate clashes in the crowded skies over Syria.

By freezing the information channel between the two potent militaries, Russia is signaling to Washington that it will tolerate no further strikes on Syrian government facilities.

Syria has aging Soviet-built aircraft and air defense missile systems, while Russia has deployed dozens of its cutting edge warplanes and air defense batteries at its base in Syria’s coastal province of Latakia. It also has a strategically important naval outpost in the Syrian port of Tartus, which is protected by air defense assets.

Further upping the ante, the Russian Defense Ministry said it will now help strengthen Syrian air defenses.

U.S. officials accused Russia of failing to ensure Syrian President Bashar Assad’s commitment to a 2013 deal for the destruction of Assad’s chemical weapons arsenal. The U.S. says that arsenal was tapped for a chemical attack that killed dozens of civilians in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province.

Trump cited the chemical attack as justification for the missile strike on a Syrian air base. But the Kremlin insists Assad’s government wasn’t responsible for the attack, saying civilians in Khan Sheikhoun were exposed to toxic agents from a rebel arsenal that was hit by Syrian warplanes.

“President Putin believes that the U.S. strikes on Syria represent an aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law under a far-fetched pretext,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement. “Washington’s move deals a significant blow to Russia-U.S. relations, which are already in deplorable shape.”

Until the attack on the Syrian air base, the U.S. had avoided striking Assad’s forces for fear of provoking a clash with the Russian military.

The action comes ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s trip to Moscow next week.

The Kremlin initially had been encouraged by Trump’s goal of repairing ties with Moscow, which plunged to post-Cold War lows under President Barack Obama, but hopes for a thaw have withered amid the congressional investigation of possible links between Trump campaign officials and Russia. The U.S. missile strike could make it all but impossible to improve relations.

“Some people here thought that it would be easy to deal with Trump,” Yelena Suponina, a Moscow-based Mideast expert, said in televised remarks. “No, it will be very difficult. He’s not only ready to make tough decisions, he is unpredictable.”

Mikhail Yemelyanov, a senior member of the lower house of parliament, warned that the U.S. action raised the threat of a direct clash between Russia and the U.S.

“Consequences could be grave, up to military confrontation and exchange of blows, nothing can be excluded,” he said, according to the Interfax news agency.

Tillerson said Russia had “failed in its responsibility” to deliver on a 2013 deal it helped broker to destroy Syria’s chemical arsenal.

“So either Russia has been complicit, or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,” he said.

By ordering the strike, Trump threatened the military assets of Assad, who has enjoyed Russia’s support throughout the six-year conflict. Russia’s military has helped turn the war in Assad’s favor and Moscow has used its U.N. Security Council veto to protect Damascus from censure.

Russia also has important military facilities in Syria that could be put at risk if Assad is removed from power, a goal of Western powers that had recently been put on the back burner because of the focus on fighting Islamic State extremists in Syria and Iraq.

Peskov said the U.S. gave Russia advance notice about the strike. He added that Moscow believes it makes no sense to maintain the hotline.

Asked if the decision to freeze the information exchange could raise the risk of midair incidents, Peskov said it was the U.S. attack that increased such danger.

Peskov wouldn’t say if Russia could use its military assets to protect Syrian facilities from future U.S. strikes.

Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia will quickly “strengthen the Syrian air defense system and increase its efficiency in order to protect Syria’s most sensitive infrastructure facilities.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b531eb55b:1add056:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com

Russia’s policies thrown into confusion as US resumes its ‘world policeman’ role

President Trump reinstates the ‘Truman Doctrine’

Shock and euphoria follow the missile strike on Syria

Russia’s policies thrown into confusion as US resumes its ‘world policeman’ role



German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, ‘This attack by the United States of America is understandable, given the aspect of the war crimes, given the suffering of innocent people and given the logjam in the UN Security Council.’

The events of the past week were not only a major humiliation to Russia, but will also have to trigger a major strategic change in Russia’s foreign policy.

The unexpected US cruise missile strike in response to the horrific Sarin gas attack by Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province, killing up to 100 people, left Russia scrambling to take face-saving measures. So Russia canceled its “deconfliction agreement” with US designed to prevent accidental clashes between the two air forces in Syria, though this agreement will almost certainly be restored within weeks. War criminal al-Assad did his part by ordering new air strikes on the same town, Khan Sheikhoun, but this with conventional weapons. However, to bring the point home, al-Assad committed a new war crime when his missiles struck a hospital where people are recovering from al-Assad’s Sarin gas attack. Russia, Syria and Iran may take further retaliatory moves.

However, the big picture is that this week’s events will require a strategic change in Russia’s policies.

As I reported in April, 2011, Russia at that time adopted a policy of using the United Nations Security Council to cripple Nato and US foreign policy, a strategy that has been very successful for them for six years.

Early in 2011, Russia had abstained on the UNSC resolution authorizing a “humanitarian” military action in Libya. As the Libyan intervention unfolded, Russia viewed the increasingly complex situation as “mission creep,” and regretted not vetoing the resolution.

After that, Russia demanded that Nato and the US strictly limit their activities, and Russia would back up this demand by vetoing any attempt to go further than Russia desired. This would allow Russia to effectively control many activities of Nato and the US, since only activities approved by the Security Council, and hence by Russia, could ever be permitted.

This set up a “double standard,” because Russia would do what it wanted, without seeking approval from the UNSC. Russia invaded Georgia and took control of two provinces, without asking the UNSC. Russia invaded East Ukraine and took control of two provinces, without asking the UNSC. Russia invaded Crimea and annexed it, without asking the UNSC. At the same time, any military action by the West would have to be approved by the UNSC.

Now President Trump has done the same thing, ordering a military strike without asking the UNSC. This act nullifies the policies adopted by Russia in 2011, and requires a change in direction, though the nature of that change remains to be seen. AP and CNBC and CNN

President Trump reinstates the ‘Truman Doctrine’

Russia now has to throw out that “double standard” strategy, because the new US administration is willing to do what Russia has been doing all along – take military action when considered necessary, without asking permission from the UN Security Council (nor, by the way, from the US Congress).

President Donald Trump seems willing to reinstate the “Truman Doctrine” that had been repudiated by President Obama. President Harry Truman announced the Truman Doctrine in 1947, essentially making America the “policeman of the world.” Truman’s justification is that it is better to have a small military action to stop an ongoing crime than to let it slide and end up having an enormous conflict like World War II. The Truman Doctrine was reaffirmed in President John Kennedy’s “ask not” speech, and every president since WW II has followed the Truman Doctrine, up to and including George Bush. Barack Obama is the first president to repudiate the Truman Doctrine, essentially leaving the world without a policeman.

The concept of America being the “world’s policeman” was very controversial in 1947 and it is very controversial today. And yet, we have seen what has happened in the last eight years, when the world had no policeman.

There are news reports of a power struggle in the White House, and that power struggle can be interpreted as a disagreement over reinstating the Truman Doctrine. Reportedly, Steve Bannon opposes military actions like the one this week in Syria, while Jared Kushner favors it. The outcome of this power struggle, which goes to the heart of the Truman Doctrine concepts, could have a defining effect on American foreign policy, as well as on Russia’s foreign policy.

Shock and euphoria follow the missile strike on Syria

America’s missile strike in Syria has received widespread praise as a valid response to Bashar al-Assad’s war crimes, but not with President Trump’s base.

I saw this myself in the stream of comments to the Breitbart version of my April 6 article “President Trump plans military action on Syria after horrific nerve gas attack on civilians.”

Most of the comments appeared from people among Trump’s strongest supporters, but they were shocked by this article, because they believed that Trump would never order a military intervention in the Mideast, something that many of them oppose. A lot of anger was directed at me, accusing me of “fake news,” and accusing me of being a “Libtard” and trying to mislead people.

But all that changed on Thursday evening around 10 PM ET, when reports of the military action started coming out, proving that the article was completely accurate. At that point, the anger that many of the commenters had directed at me began to be directed at President Trump.

Some of the comments were completely delusional, such as describing the Sarin gas attack as a “false flag” operation, sometimes going so far as to accuse Trump of ordering the Sarin attack himself in order to have an excuse to bomb Syria. Probably the angriest comments were some variation of the delusional “false flag” claim.

At the other end of the spectrum were comments that were very thoughtful. Many people posted variations of “I voted for Trump, but I didn’t vote for this.” There were some detailed analyses of why we should never go into the Mideast, saying that we have tried in the past and never accomplished anything, and one person saying that we should let them kill each other so that they won’t try to kill us.

However, in the mainstream media, in the US, Europe and the Mideast, comments by world leaders have been extremely supportive, almost verging on euphoria that the US is showing leadership once more.

From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, both the controversy and the euphoria are to be expected at a military attack that could begin an all-out war. Any military attack is going to be controversial, but the population can also easily become heavily invested and become euphoric.

Here’s how historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch describes how the euphoria at the beginning of a war is itself highly delusional in his 2001 book, The Culture of Defeat: On National Trauma, Mourning, and Recovery:

The passions excited in the national psyche by the onset of war show how deeply invested the masses now were in its potential outcome. Propaganda had reinforced their conviction that “everything was at stake,” and the threat of death and defeat functioned like a tightly coiled spring, further heightening the tension. The almost festive jubilation that accompanied the declarations of war in Charleston in 1861 [American Civil War], Paris in 1870 [Franco-Prussian war], and the capitals of the major European powers in 1914 [World War I] were anticipatory celebrations of victory — since nations are as incapable of imagining their own defeat as individuals are of conceiving their own death. The new desire to humiliate the enemy, noted by Burckhardt, was merely a reaction to the unprecedented posturing in which nations now engaged when declaring war. The deployment of armies on the battlefield is the classic manifestation of collective self-confidence. If both sides are not convinced of their military superiority, there will be no confrontation; rather, those who lack confidence will simply flee the field. Accordingly, the battle is decided the moment the confidence of one side fails. The will to fight (“morale”) evaporates, the military formation collapses, and the army seeks salvation in flight or, if it is lucky, in organized retreat. The Greek term for this point in space (on the battlefield) and time (the course of the battle) was trope. The victors demarcated the spot with the weapons of the vanquished and later with monuments, yielding the term tropaion, from which we get our word trophy. (p. 6-7)

The euphoria goes on until something goes wrong, usually some kind of military disaster, such as the Battle of Bull Run in 1861 or the Bataan Death March in 1941.

The panicked reaction can be much greater when a military disaster occurs. In his 1832 book, On War, General Carl von Clausewitz describes what happens:

The effect of defeat outside the army — on the people and on the government — is a sudden collapse of the wildest expectations, and total destruction of self-confidence. The destruction of these feelings creates a vacuum, and that vacuum gets filled by a fear that grows corrosively, leading to total paralysis. It’s a blow to the whole nervous system of the losing side, as if caused by an electric charge. This effect may appear to a greater or lesser degree, but it’s never completely missing. Then, instead of rushing to repair the misfortune with a spirit of determination, everyone fears that his efforts will be futile; or he does nothing, leaving everything to Fate.

From the point of view of Generational Dynamics, the events that cause this “sudden collapse” and “total destruction” of self-confidence are called “regeneracy events,” because they regenerate civic unity for the first time since the end of the preceding crisis war.

You do not need any particular methodology to understand that the whole world has become increasingly unstable in the last ten years. Because the political atmosphere is already extremely vitriolic and is likely to worsen further, it is worth repeating what I’ve written many times: Generational Dynamics predicts that the Mideast is headed for a major regional war, pitting Sunnis versus Shias, Jews versus Arabs, and various ethnic groups against each other. This is coming with 100% certainty, irrespective of who is president. Furthermore, the president can neither cause nor prevent this outcome. Maybe Trump’s missile attack will speed up this war, or maybe it will delay it. It could go either way. If Hillary Clinton had won, she might have made the same missile attack for the same reasons that Trump did. It is impossible to tell. The only thing that we can be sure of is that we have no way of knowing what the scenario will be, only that a regional war will be the result, in this generational Crisis era. CNN and philly.com

TANTA, Egypt (AP) — Bombs exploded at two Coptic churches in different cities in northern Egypt as worshippers were celebrating Palm Sunday, killing at least 43 people and wounding about 100 in an assault claimed by the Islamic State group.

The blasts came at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter, and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit the Arab world’s most populous country, which has been beset by extremist violence against its minority Christians.

In the first attack, a bomb went off inside St. George’s Church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta, killing at least 27 people and wounding 78, officials said.

A few hours later, a suicide bomber rushed toward St. Mark’s Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt, killing at least 16 people and wounding 41, the Interior Ministry said.

CCTV images broadcast on Egyptian channels showed a man in a blue pullover approach the main gate to St. Mark’s but being turned away and directed toward a metal detector. The man then passes a female police officer chatting to another woman, and enters a metal detector before an explosion engulfs the area.

Pope Tawadros II had held Palm Sunday services at the cathedral, but his aides said he had escaped unharmed. The timing of the attack raised the question of whether the bomber had sought to assassinate the pope, leader of one of the world’s oldest Christian communities.

IS claimed the attacks via its Aamaq news agency, after having recently warned that it would step up violence against Egypt’s Christians.

CBC TV showed footage from inside the church in Tanta, where people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers.

“After the explosion, everything became dark from the smoke,” said Edmond Edward, attending services with his brother, Emil, who was wounded and leaned on him for support at a nearby hospital, his head covered in bandages.

“There was a clear lapse in security, which must be tightened from now on to save lives,” he said. He added that the blast appeared to be centered near the altar and that the priest leading the service, Father Daniel, was wounded.

Susan Mikhail, whose apartment balcony across the street has a clear view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building.

“Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,” she told The Associated Press. Later, the more seriously wounded were carried out by other survivors and taken to hospitals in private cars, she said.

Hundreds of residents gathered in the area, and church members blocked people — including journalists — from entering the church as police cordoned off the area.

Regional police chief Brig. Gen. Hossam Elddin Khalifa was fired over the incident, with Maj. Gen. Tarek Hassouna replacing him, state-run newspaper al-Ahram reported.

Pope Francis, marking Palm Sunday in St. Peter’s Square, decried the bombings, expressing “deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation.”

He is due to visit Egypt April 28-29.

President Donald Trump tweeted that he is “so sad to hear of the terrorist attack” against the U.S. ally but added that he has “great confidence” that Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, “will handle the situation properly.” The two leaders met at the White House on April 3.

Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt’s Al-Azhar — the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam — also condemned the attacks, calling them a “despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.”

Both Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza condemned the bombings as well.

The bombings added to fears that Islamic extremists who have long been battling security forces in the Sinai Peninsula are shifting their focus to civilians.

An Islamic State affiliate claimed a December suicide bombing at a Cairo church that killed about 30 people, mostly women, as well as a string of killings in the northern Sinai that caused hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas of the country.

The militants recently released a video vowing to step up attacks against Christians, whom they regard as “infidels” empowering the West against Muslims.

Egypt has struggled to combat a wave of Islamic militancy since the 2013 military overthrow of an elected Islamist president.

The Sinai-based IS affiliate has mainly attacked police and soldiers, but has also claimed bombings that killed civilians, including the downing of a Russian passenger jetliner in the Sinai in 2015, which killed all 224 people aboard and devastated Egypt’s tourism industry.

Egypt’s Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East. They have long complained of discrimination and that the government does not do enough to protect them.

Egyptian media had previously reported that the church in Tanta had been targeted before, with a bomb defused there in late March.

The Copts were largely supportive of the military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, and incurred the wrath of many of his followers, who attacked churches and other Christian institutions.

While the Copts have stood steadfast alongside the government, repeating the mantra that Egyptians were all being targeted by terrorists, an increase in attacks on Christians has tested that support.

Outside the Tanta hospital, 27-year-old carpenter Maged Saleh flew into a rage as blood streamed from his arm after he and his mother escaped the explosion.

“Where is the government?” he screamed at onlookers. “There is no government!”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b5317c48f:1ad4b2e:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Actor-director Sean Penn lashed out at President Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon, calling the former naval officer turned film executive a “Hollywood wannabe.”

“Bannon was then, as he is now, simply another bitter Hollywood wannabe who went rogue by way of toxic narcissistic iconoclasm,” Penn said in an interview published Friday by deathandtaxes. “But, deep in his heart, he’s just a conniving hateful bloated punk who despises mankind.”

“And then there are also the bad things about him,” Penn added.

Penn’s directorial debut, the 1991 drama The Indian Runner, was executive produced by Bannon.

The 56-year-old actor, who supported Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, has hurled personal attacks against team Trump in the past.

In a September appearance on CBS’s The Late Show, Penn compared voting for Trump to “masturbating our way into hell.”

“I don’t think it’s a political debate going on. It’s a social debate. It’s basically there are two options,” Penn said to host Stephen Colbert. He went on:

Either you can decide to divorce yourself from loving your children and piss on a tree and show that you have the power to piss on a tree. Or you can go out and vote in a very big way for someone like Hillary Clinton–who then you can challenge and support which is the only way that any kind of president can have any success.

“And you stick it out for four years, or we can just masturbate our way into hell with a guy who looks like the only blond magician,” Penn said.

After President Donald Trump’s Education Secretary was barred by progressive activists from entering a Washington D.C. middle school, a reassessment of her security recommended additional protection at the cost of $7.8 million tax dollars thus far.

Due to the constant wave of death threats by progressives, the U.S. Marshals service was forced to reevaluate the usual security plans for education department leaders.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has received far more death threats than any past Ed Secs, the U.S. Marshals told the Washington Post.

In February, DeVos, a supporter of charter schools, was accosted by a group of progressive protesters who barred her entry to Jefferson Middle School Academy in D.C. The protesters carried signs reading “Black Lives Matter,” and “Feminists Are the Majority.” At least one screamed, “Shame!” at DeVos when the newly emplaced Ed Sec arrived at the school. The protesters prevented DeVos from entering the school’s front doors and she had to be let in through a back entrance, surrounded by security.

Past Ed Secs garnered far less public notice and were usually protected at much less cost by Department of Education employees, some of whom were once Secret Service agents. But due to the extreme level of threats, DeVos’s security was transferred to the U.S. Marshals.

The extreme costs have been incurred because the Marshals service had to hire additional employees to handle the heightened security plans. And the costs reported thus far will increase as the year rolls on, according to sources.

Trump’s education chief is opposed by the country’s teachers unions as well as those looking to keep education controlled from Washington D.C.

An illegal alien who allegedly twice raped his 15-year-old stepdaughter now stands accused of murdering the girl after Obama’s Department of Justice refused to prosecute him on human smuggling charges. ICE officers were never able to deport the man despite a lengthy criminal history that includes charges of assault, burglary, and human smuggling.

Many opportunities to prevent the needless rape and murder of a young Texas girl slipped by the wayside before 36-year-old Armando Rodrigo Garcia-Ramirez twice impregnated his victim, Jennifer Delgado. In 2008, police arrested the Mexican national for assault. A local prosecutor chose to drop the charges, the Washington Times reported. In 2009, Garcia-Ramires found himself in custody – this time, charged with assault. Prosecutors also dismissed this charge.

In 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers took arrested the man and attempted to deport him. A judge granted the man bond and released him. No further information about this case is currently available.

ICE officers took another shot at deporting Garcia-Ramirez in 2016 after he was arrested and charged with smuggling five illegal aliens into the country. ICE officers arrested him and asked the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas to press charges. Claiming the lack of a good witness, the U.S. Attorney declined to prosecute.

By this time, the 36-year-old man had already fathered a child with the teenage girl who he would later kill, the Daily Mail reported. One month later, he impregnated the girl again.

Despite his criminal history, Garcia-Ramirez applied for legal status. The Obama Administration granted him a work permit.

In early March, Garcia-Ramirez asked the teenage girl’s mother to meet him at a bank so that he could give her some money they had been arguing over. The mother, identified in court records as “O,” left Delgado and her baby at home while she went to meet him at the bank.

Instead of meeting “O” at the bank, Garcia-Ramirez went to the house and shot the 9-month pregnant girl twice, killing her and her unborn child. He left the 1-year-old child unharmed and fled the scene, the Daily Mail reported.

“O” called him to ask where he was and he told her he was near her apartment. He said he couldn’t live without her and shot himself with his .22 caliber handgun.

Police arrived and found the man alive. He sustained a bullet wound to his chin. Police reported he held the pistol in the air and pulled the trigger and then collapsed. An ambulance transported the man to a local hospital where he received treatment for his self-inflicted wound.

The two responding officers then went to the apartment and found the young girl. Garcia-Rameriz reportedly shot her several times in the head.

Garcia-Ramirez remains in custody in the Bexar County jail in San Antonio without bond. He faces two counts of capital murder.

ICE placed an immigration detainer on the Mexican national.

This is not the first time a Mexican national has gone on to commit heinous crimes after the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Antonio declined prosecution of a criminal alien.

At about the same time the DOJ refused to prosecute Garcia-Ramirez on the human smuggling charges, prosecutors in the San Antonio DOJ office declined to prosecute Nicondemo Coria-Gonzales, a four-time previously deported illegal alien from Mexico. ICE officials requested the Mexican national be prosecuted for illegal re-entry after deportation. Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers were left with no option but to deport the man again. He returned a few months later and began a crime spree leaving at least nine Austin women assaulted and raped, Breitbart Texas reported.

President Barack Obama appointed Richard L. Durbin, Jr., as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas in December 2014. He remains in that position following the swearing in of President Donald Trump in January.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R, KY) recently insisted that the open seat on the U.S. Supreme Court just filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch was a key factor in President Donald Trump’s White House victory last November.

Speaking of the the Supreme Court vacancy, Sen. McConnell told the Washington Examiner, “At the end, this issue more than any other elected Donald Trump, because, at the end, you had two candidates who were overwhelmingly unpopular.”

McConnell noted that blocking President Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court seat suddenly left vacant after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016 was important.

As Obama’s remaining months in office wound down last year, he made the uncommon move of nominating a replacement for Scalia instead of waiting for the results of the then-upcoming election and allowing the next president to make a nomination.

As leader of the Senate, McConnell decided not to allow the Garland nomination to move forward, arguing that since the election was so close, the next president — whether it be Trump or Clinton — should be allowed the nomination.

According to McConnell, the possibility that a Republican could get the next nomination energized the drive to elect Trump.

“Nobody was predicting Trump would get 90 percent of the Republican vote just like Mitt Romney did [in 2012,] but he did,” McConnell said. “And the single biggest reason was, they wanted him to make the Supreme Court appointment, not Hillary Clinton.”

“This call was made in February,” McConnell concluded. “We didn’t know who our nominee was going to be yet. What I did not predict was that we would nominate somebody who a lot of Republicans questioned whether he was a Republican. I mean, after all, Donald Trump was having fundraisers for [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer four or five years ago.”

Before his election, Donald Trump met with several groups of conservatives and asked for their recommendation as to whom he should pick for the Supreme Court and then made the unusual move of publicizing his list of possible picks. Trump’s move brought in many voices of support for his campaign that he may not otherwise have won.

Donald Trump ran and won on a platform summarized by the slogan America First.

Donald Trump campaigned on a promise of no more wars of choice: no military interventions to liberate other countries, to intervene in so-called “humanitarian” crusades, to force regime change, to coercively spread democracy, or to take sides in other people’s wars or civil wars.

In summation, our military would be used only in the defense of our own country or our closest allies. This was the promise. This was the commitment to the American people made over and over again. It was contrasted with the same old, same old, discredited, interventionist policies embodied first by Jeb Bush, and most of Trump’s primary adversaries, and later by Hillary Clinton.

Donald Trump offered Americans a clear, unequivocal choice: America would no longer be policeman of the world. Her sons and daughters would no longer spill their blood in far away countries for causes not directly and plainly tied to our own national security.

As we have seen, in humankind’s history, there is no end to atrocities, massacres, and bloodletting. The Middle East, in particular, is an ever-boiling cauldron of fratricide. Certainly, all people and all nations have an interest in promoting peace and an end to the killing. But it does not follow that the people of the United States should put their safety, their security, and their own people at risk to militarily interfere in these intractable conflicts, however brutal and heinous they may be. Have we learned nothing at all from our disastrous and costly military involvement of the recent sixteen years?

There is no sure way to know which belligerent used poison gas on its enemies, with the resulting horrific effects on the civilian population. We have heard the vaunted ‘government assurances’ before. Excuse this citizen of skepticism. Here is what we do know for sure: civil wars end when one side wins. Period. The longer the wars drag on, the more people are harmed, brutalized, and killed. The longer the war, the higher the civilian casualties. If we seek to lessen the horror, it is counterproductive to escalate the violence. It is a simple concept: first, do no harm.

Starting wars always seems justified in the moment. The problem is that no one knows what will happen next and no one ever knows how or when it will end. The cost in blood and treasure is inevitably greater than anyone ever thinks.

Then, there’s the question of selective outrage. Saudi Arabian warplanes have been relentlessly bombing civilian areas in Yemen for months. At least 15,000 have been killed. Where are the images of these dead and mutilated children? Where is CNN’s outrage with her sanctimonious celebrity pundits calling for regime change in Riyadh? Why hasn’t President Trump initiated a cruise missile attack on a Saudi airbase?

The question must be asked. If the United States militarily intervenes in Syria, effectively taking one barbarous side over the other, what is the effect on our own national security? Is it in the interest of the American people to further undermine any chance of constructive engagement with Russia? Is it to our advantage to return to a neo-Cold War with all the existential risks which may follow? Exactly why should the American people put their own country and their own children at greater risk?

A week ago, President Trump reiterated he is “not president of the world.” Previously he took an oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution – not the UN charter or some vague, high-minded, internationalist creed.

The Syrian Civil War is not America’s war. It was raging all during the presidential primaries and the election of ’16. We saw the devastation of Aleppo in the weeks before Election Day. It was all over the headlines. Trump made it abundantly clear that he would not intervene. On the other hand, Clinton advocated arming the ‘rebels’ and the risky enforcement of U.S.- imposed no-fly zones over Syria, effectively putting U.S. warplanes in hair-trigger proximity to Russian, Turkish, and Syrian fighter jets. What could possibly go wrong? The American people elected Trump. The message was loud and clear. Keep out. Stay out. It’s not our war.

But yesterday, we heard the president justifying a military attack with words that could have been spoken by Hillary Clinton. Did we have an election or didn’t we?

President Trump has a choice. He can stay the course he set in the campaign, in his inaugural speech and in the first days of his presidency, keeping America First. Or, he can succumb to the selective hysteria of the Corporate Media, to his most ardent critics, to the omnipresent chorus of NeverTrump Republicans and to the beltway’s permanent war party to choose the path of America Last.

Donald Trump kept his word, Mitch McConnell played hardball, and together they triumphed over Chuck Schumer and the liberal establishment. April 7 should be marked on every patriot’s calendar as a turning point in history.

How long has it been since we had a policy victory of this magnitude? America now has a 50-50 chance to return to constitutional government.

If you think I am exaggerating the importance of having a true originalist in the Scalia chair on the Supreme Court, consider this question: If Neil Gorsuch had been writing the 5-4 majority opinion in the 2012 NFIB v. Sebelius challenge to Obamacare, would we still have Obamacare? No way, Jose.

Adding Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a historic turning point for three reasons besides the obvious one of having a strong conservative in Scalia’s chair. The Republican Party should heed the lessons taught by this victory if they want to actually govern the country instead of merely taking over the command of a doomed Titanic.

First, the U.S. Senate Republicans showed unusual courage and uncharacteristic stamina. When Justice Scalia died suddenly in early 2016, President Obama moved swiftly to fill the vacancy. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley decided the vacancy on the court should be filled by the winner of the 2016 presidential election and not by a lame duck incumbent. Indeed, no less an authority on Supreme Court vacancies than Democrat leader Chuck Schumer had proposed the same thing back in 2008 when George Bush was the lame duck. McConnell and the Senate Republicans held their ground despite the onslaught of criticism from the new power trilogy of the mainstream media, Hollywood comedians, and Obama Legacy stockholders.

Then, in the middle of his campaign in 2016, candidate Donald Trump drew up a list of 21 conservative judges, made it public, and promised to select his first Supreme Court nominee from that list. Publishing that list was in itself radically unconventional and a bold gamble. But then he did a really unconventional thing and kept that promise by selecting Neil Gorsuch, a 10th Circuit Court judge who was probably among the two or three most conservative judges on that list of twenty-one. Golly, Batman, what next?!!

And then came the coup de gras — not just ending opposition to Gorsuch but also giving Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee much better odds for confirmation.

Democrats announced they would filibuster to block a full Senate vote on the Gorsuch appointment since it takes 60 votes to end a filibuster, not a simple majority of 51. Senate Republicans rose to the occasion by pulling the “nuclear trigger” ending the filibuster rule altogether, thereby not just stopping the filibuster against Gorsuch but also ending the filibuster threat against all future court nominees as well.

Mitch McConnell had his finest hour as Senate Republican leader by holding that gang of 52 Republicans together and delivering on his promise to President Trump.

All three elements of this miracle are worthy of praise– Trump’s courage in publishing the list, his wisdom in selecting Gorsuch, and McConnell’s stellar leadership and political craftsmanship in delivering the victory despite universal, virulent Democrat opposition.

Why is this victory so pivotal and so monumental? The answer is simple: a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court is absolutely central to the survival of our Republic. The rule of law has become the rule of judges, and the Supreme Court is the final check on the rule of bad judges – -of which we have a few hundred in our federal courts thanks to decades of poor judicial appointments.

Let us recall that the infamous 1973 Roe v. Wade 7-2 decision was written by a Republican nominee, Harry Blackman. More recently, Obamacare survived a court challenge because of the linguistic creativity of a Republican chief justice.

The lessons to be learned from the Gorsuch victory are many, but this is the main one: We can restore the rule of law and true constitutionalism to the Supreme Court only if we have all three elements of the winning formula: a President with the wisdom to appoint the right judges, a Senate Republican leadership with the courage to fulfill its constitutional obligations, and a nation with a majority willing to support those choices.

The Gorsuch appointment dwarfs in importance anything else Trump can or will do in the next four years and more than balances the inevitable disappointments and missteps he will send our way.

Some people will think I am enthusiastic about Gorsuch only because he is likely to uphold Trump’s Executive Orders on immigration, but they are mistaken. I earnestly hope he will have the opportunity in the next few years to overturn bad precedents in Kelo (2005), Chevron (1984), and Roe (1973) decisions and many others.

We can and will disagree with President Trump on some issues, such as trade policy, infrastructure boondoggles, and foreign policy mistakes like military involvement in Syria’s civil war. In fact, I may not agree with Trump’s every proposal or action on immigration and border security. But no matter: gaining conservative control of the Supreme Court makes the Trump presidency a success no matter what happens tomorrow.

The Republican success in delivering the Gorsuch confirmation greatly overshadow the Republican Party’s many warts and weaknesses. I have decided to rejoin the Republican party as the best available vehicle for defending and sustaining our constitutional Republic.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4ff65ea4:16f92e7:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s broadcast of “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks praised the Syria strike by saying “it was incumbent upon the US to do something when chemical weapons were used.” And “there is some upside to having somebody who’s a little unpredictable.”

Brooks said, “The question what’s next strikes me as a secondary question. The primary question is, what are we going to do about chemical warfare? A hundred years ago, right now, World War I was going on, and there were people were being gassed in the trenches. And the fact that the world community has basically tried to eliminate chemical weapons since that time strikes me as a great achievement. And to go back on that would be a great step backward for civilization. And Barack Obama, unfortunately, didn’t do anything when chemical weapons were used. So, I think it was incumbent upon the US to do something when chemical weapons were used.”

He continued, “Does this signal some grand change of strategy in the Middle East? I sort of doubt it. But at least we set this precedent on this particular issue. Now, the question –, I think it was probably totally impulsive of President Trump to do this. He’s an impulsive person, and we’re stuck the downsides of his impulsivity. But there are upsides to having an impulsive president because nobody in the world, and especially in places like North Korea, quite knows what’s going to happen. And so, frankly, there are some advantages to that.”

Brooks later added, “I would rather have a strategy, obviously. But I’m just pointing out there is some upside to having somebody who’s a little unpredictable. … I suspect it was a one-off case…but I think it was the right one-off thing to do.”

Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday called on Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) to reconvene the just-recessed Congress for debate on the United States’ Thursday night airstrikes on a Syrian military airbase.

Shortly after Thursday night’s 60-missile strike, President Donald Trump read a statement which proclaimed that he ordered the attack in response to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad launching chemical attacks on innocent Syrian civilians on Tuesday.

Early Friday morning Pelosi tweeted out a letter to Speaker Ryan in which she writes, “I am writing to request that you call the House back in session immediately to debate any decision to place our men and women in uniform in harm’s way.”

The letter continues:

Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons attack on his own people places him outside the circle of civilized human behavior. Assad also continues to attack his own people with conventional weapons. Meanwhile, Russia props up the Assad regime and enables its brutal war crimes to continue. The President’s action and any response demands that we immediately do our duty. Congress must live up to its Constitutional responsibility to debate an Authorization of the Use of Military Force against a sovereign nation. As heartbreaking as Assad’s chemical weapons attacks on his own people was, the crisis in Syria will not be resolved by one night of airstrikes. The killing will not stop without a comprehensive political solution to end the violence. The American people are owed a comprehensive strategy with clear objectives to keep our brave men and women in uniform safe and avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians in Syria.

Directly following the U.S. airstrikes, Pelosi responded with condemnation of the Syrian government’s chemical and other attacks on its own people. She stated, in part, “Tonight’s strike in Syria appears to be a proportional response to the regime’s use of chemical weapons. If the President intends to escalate the U.S. military’s involvement in Syria, he must to come to Congress for an Authorization for Use of Military Force which is tailored to meet the threat and prevent another open-ended war in the Middle East.”

Overall reaction to the U.S. strikes has been mixed on both sides of the aisle. Republican Sen. Rand Paul has condemned the attacks as “illegal” and “unconstitutional.” Sen. Ted Cruz has expressed great anticipation to hear Trump make the case for military action in Syria and said he is “encouraged” by the Trump Administration’s foreign policy. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the strikes “the right thing to do.” Democrat Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said, “It angers and saddens me that President Trump has taken the advice of war hawks and escalated our illegal regime change war to overthrow the Syrian government.”

Congress recessed on Thursday for a two-week Easter break. Pelosi is calling on Ryan to call members right back.

Tweets from a Fresno State lecturer Lars Maischak not only demonstrate stark disagreement with capitalism, Christianity, and the GOP, but also a declaration that President Trump “must hang” to save democracy.

Maischak teaches America History at the university.

His February 17 tweet speaks for itself:

To save American democracy, Trump must hang. The sooner and the higher, the better. #TheResistance #DeathToFascism https://t.co/DSsV53sbO2 — Lars Maischak (@LarsMaischak) February 18, 2017

Other tweets on Maischak’s profile demonstrate the ideology behind statements about Trump hanging and explain why universities across the country are now viewed with disdain by average, salt-of-the-earth Americans.

Here is another tweet from Maischak, dated March 8:

Don&apos;t tell me to &quot;obey the Law.&quot; &quot;The Law&quot; in this country is one part Racism, one part Class Oppression, all Capitalism. #TheResistance — Lars Maischak (@LarsMaischak) March 8, 2017

And another dates March 3:

Judging from the largely absent facial markings this year, Christianity is paying the price for its pact with Fascism. Students abandon it. — Lars Maischak (@LarsMaischak) March 4, 2017

This is today’s academia. These are types of voices hired to teach recent high school graduates American History. How do you think George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson fare when taught by one who sees the world in this way?

How do you think America’s Judeo-Christian heritage fares?

During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump stated that on border security, “we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time.”

Transcript as Follows:

“My Fellow Americans,

We’re only 11 weeks in, but already my administration has achieved historic progress for the American people – in fact, 93% of our domestic manufacturers have expressed optimism in the future, a record.

The confidence we are seeing in our Nation is about jobs and opportunity – but it’s also about safety and security.

Security begins at the border – as a candidate, I pledged to take swift and decisive action to secure the border, and that is exactly what I have done. We inherited a full-fledged border crisis – it was a disaster. Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64% reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border.

At the same time, we are conducting enforcement actions across the country to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our society – and they’ll be gone. In just the last few days our Nation’s ICE officers have arrested 153 criminal aliens in south Texas, 84 criminal aliens in the Pacific Northwest, and 31 criminal aliens in Long Island, New York – these arrests include aliens convicted of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, sexual assault against a child, smuggling, drug dealing, and many more.

Much work needs to be done to reverse decades of harm caused by open border policies from Washington – but, with time, dedication, and effort, we will get the job done, and save countless lives in the process.

Providing security for the American People also means restoring America’s standing in the world.

From the very start of my Presidency, I have worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe.

This week, I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House. Now, I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China at the Southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples.

In our dealings with other nations, our conversations have been candid, open, and grounded in mutual respect.

I have been clear about advocating for the national interests of the United States, something so important to me, and so important to our people – one of the reasons, certainly, that I got elected. And I want to ensure that the decisions we make truly serve the safety and security of our citizens.

In matters both economic and military, we understand that a strong America is in the best interests of the world – that is why it is so important that as we strengthen international partnerships, we ensure these partnerships deliver real results for Americans and the American people.

Our decisions will be guided by our values and our goals – and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences.

A future of peace, safety, and prosperity – that is our guiding light, and always will be.

Together, we will bring about this future for the land we love, and for the people who call it home.

We love our country, and we love the American people. Thank you.”

President Donald Trump discussed several issues with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their high-profile meetings at Mar-a-lago this week.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that Trump was able to build on his important relationship with the president of China but was “frank” and “candid” about their differences.

“I think all of us are feeling very good about the results of this summit in terms of what it did for setting a very constructive tone going forward,” he said.

Chinese State media noted that “Xi’s two-day trip at Mar-a-Lago was marked by cordiality, with both presidents seen smile [sic] to each other.”

Some issues discussed during the visit are important to the United States:

Trade and Currency

Trump told the Chinese that they needed to “level the playing field for American workers,” according to a statement from the White House. He expressed concerns about the Chinese government’s intervention in U.S. economy was hurting jobs for the American worker.

Both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross spoke positively of a “100-day plan” that they discussed with their Chinese counterparts to make important changes immediately.

“The most interesting thing to me was they expressed an interest in reducing their net trade balance because of the impact it’s having on money supply and inflation,” Ross said about the Chinese. “That’s the first time I’ve heard them say that in a bilateral context.”

According to Xinhua, the Chinese state media, President Xi urged both countries to “grasp the opportunity” of economic development between the two countries and signaled interest in future investments.

“China welcomes the U.S. side to participate in cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative,” said Xi.

North Korea

Trump and the Chinese agreed that North Korea’s nuclear weapons program presented a challenge to the region and said that they would take steps to pressure the rogue state with the “international community.”

No agreement was reached, but the United States reasserted that it is willing to act alone.

“[W]e understand it creates unique problems for them and challenges and that we would, and are, prepared to chart our own course if this is something China is just unable to coordinate with us,” Tillerson said.

South China Sea

Officials from the United States discussed the ongoing military buildup in the East and South China Seas, but the result was merely a “candid” conversation.

“President Trump noted the importance of adhering to international rules and norms in the East and South China Seas and to previous statements on non-militarization,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.

Human Rights

Tillerson remarked that America’s commitment to human rights was “quite clear” throughout all their discussions, but it appears that specific offenses were not discussed.

“I don’t think you have to have a separate conversation, somehow separate our core values around human rights from our economic discussions, our military-to-military discussions, or our foreign policy discussions,” he said. “They’re really embedded in every discussion, that that is really what guides much of our view around how we’re going to work together.”

Spicer said in a statement that Trump “noted the importance of protecting human rights and other values deeply held by Americans” during the visit.

The Chinese state media reported that Xi called on both sides to cooperate on issues such as “drug trafficking, child trafficking, money laundering, cyber crime and organized crime.”

Trump to Visit China

Trump accepted an invitation from President Xi to visit China for a state visit at some point.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4e6f8a9c:155a996:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “The Last Word,” anchor Lawrence O’Donnell stated that “if Vladimir Putin masterminded the last week in Syria, he has gotten everything he could have asked for.” O’Donnell then floated a theory that Putin told Syria’s Bashar al-Assad to launch a small chemical attack that was big enough to attract media attention and prompt President Trump into launching a missile strike, which would then change the subject from Russian influence.

O’Donnell said, “[W]ouldn’t it be nice if it was just completely, totally, absolutely impossible to suspect that Vladimir Putin orchestrated what happened in Syria this week so that his friend in the White House could have a big night, with missiles, and all of the praise he’s picked up over the last 24 hours? Wouldn’t it be so nice if you couldn’t even in your wildest dreams imagine a scenario like that?”

He added, “I don’t know what it is. Is it a 2% chance? Is it a 50% chance? Is — I don’t know. But what — I don’t think it’s a 0% chance, and it used to be, with every other president prior to Donald Trump.”

O’Donnell further stated, “Well, when Bill Clinton fired missiles during his presidency, Republicans questioned that. They questioned whether that was to distract attention from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and that was a legitimate question.”

O’Donnell later added, “It’s perfect, just perfect. I wish it wasn’t. If Vladimir Putin, if, if, if Vladimir Putin masterminded the last week in Syria, he has gotten everything he could have asked for. Vladimir Putin was essentially the man in charge of making sure that Syria got rid of all of its chemical weapons under a deal with the Obama administration. And so it makes perfect sense to question whether President Bashar al-Assad would have checked with his most important patron, Vladimir Putin, before using chemical weapons that Vladimir Putin was supposed to have helped get rid of. It would be terribly embarrassing to Vladimir Putin if President Assad had exposed Vladimir Putin as having completely failed to get rid of those chemical weapons. You wouldn’t want to be Bashar al-Assad in a conversation with Vladimir Putin after that, unless you had a conversation with him before that. Unless Vladimir Putin said, ‘I have an idea. go ahead, do a small chemical attack, nothing like the big ones you’ve done in the past, just big enough to attract media attention. So that my friend in the White House will see it on TV. And then, Donald Trump can fire some missiles at Syria, that’ll do no real damage, and then the American news media will change the subject from Russian influence in the Trump campaign and the Trump transition and the Trump White House.’ It’s perfect.”

He continued, “For most of the news media, it changes the conventional wisdom about the dynamic between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. President Trump has finally dared to do something that Vladimir Putin doesn’t like. It changes everything. As long as you never, never question whether Vladimir Putin wanted all of this to happen this week. And when you question that and you look at what has happened, it’s always worth remembering that if Vladimir Putin really does have ways, known or unknown to Donald Trump, to influence Donald Trump, then every day that is a good day for President Trump is a good day for President Putin. Now not one word that I’ve just said could possibly have been said about any president prior to Donald Trump.”

O’Donnell further said, “you will hear opinion in this hour that is counter to the possible scenario that I have just outlined, but what you won’t hear is proof that that scenario that I’ve just outlined is impossible.”

O’Donnell did say that he raised this scenario “without assigning a statistical probability to it. I don’t know what it is. I just know that it’s not zero, and it should be zero. It has been zero with every previous president. But when you look at the way the events have unfolded this week, Donald Trump could not have asked for a better end of the week, for his presidency as he sees it.”

During the panel discussion that took place after O’Donnell’s monologue, he did concede that it did make sense to notify Russia in advance of the strike to avoid further escalation.

On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) offered President Trump wanting to “distract” people from “possible collusion with Putin” as a possible suggestion for the missile strike against Syria.

Host Bill Maher asked Lieu how Trump going against Russia to launch the strike on Syria “fit into the Republican — the liberal idea that he was installed by Putin as a stooge to do whatever Putin wanted? This is not what Putin wanted.”

Lieu responded, “If you’re facing possible collusion with Putin, you might just want to distract people.”

He added, “It might be, we don’t know. I’ve learned to not predict Donald Trump. But, in this case, what he did was not only unconstitutional, there’s no strategy. We don’t know what were doing in Syria, how long we’re going to be there. He’s got US ground forces there now that are more at risk of being attacked because he just attacked Assad. He has to tell the American people what we’re doing in Syria, he has not done that.”

On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that the Syria conflict was “tricky” for President Trump because “If Trump does the wrong thing, Putin might not re-elect him.” And that for Trump “the temptation to use his new toys” in launching the strike on Syria “was too much.”

Maher said, “Now, this is very tricky for Donald Trump, because the Syrian regime, of course, is propped up by Russia, and Russia does not want us bombing there. If Trump does the wrong thing, Putin might not re-elect him. So — but, you know what, the temptation to use his new toys was too much.”

Dr. Sebastian Gorka, deputy adviser to the president and former Breitbart News National Security editor, joined SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss the American missile attack on Syria.

“I’m going to be very specific about my comments this morning, Raheem,” Gorka began. “We know that the best way to go to war is to protect certain information sources, methods, and to make sure the enemy doesn’t know what you’re going to do next. Surprise is incredibly important. We act in a strategic fashion that’s very different from the last eight years.”

Gorka said statements made by President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made it clear whom the United States holds responsible for the Idlib chemical weapons attack.

“I’m not going to talk about percentages or how we know, but the fact that those statements were made can make everybody rest easy that yes, the regime was responsible,” he said.

Kassam noted that President Trump has been critical of intelligence mistakes in the past, and the memory of faulty intelligence leading into the Iraq War is still fresh in many minds. “Where is the strategic imperative here? How does this help the United States?” he asked.

“Very simply: because what we’re talking about is the use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians,” Gorka replied. “And I’m fully cognizant of the fact that people are very leery about prior engagements. The U.K. dossier you mentioned, specifically, will go down in history as a misuse of intelligence analysis. I understand that. But it doesn’t mean that you throw away all intelligence analysis simply when somebody politicized it once a decade ago or more than a decade ago.”

“The strategic imperative is very clear. These weapons not only are banned; they are being used against civilians. That is a global problem,” he said. “We have sent a very clear message that when you do something as heinous, as evil, as using weapons of mass destruction against unarmed civilians, you will pay a penalty. That’s why it’s in the U.S. national security interest.”

Gorka stressed it was important to “send a very clear message that these weapons are not to be used anywhere.”

“It’s a very clear national security message,” he said. “The global context affects America as much as it affects the people who were killed in that attack on Tuesday. Weapons of mass destruction are a global phenomena that have to be dealt with by a global strategy. So yes, the two things are not mutually exclusive, but the moral imperative and the national security imperative can overlap, and in this case, they do.”

Gorka said that based on preliminary assessments, the strike was “absolutely” considered successful, “simply because of the damage that was done to the airbase that was used for the chemical attack on Tuesday.”

“If you look at the response globally from those countries that have responded positively, absolutely,” he added. “However, it’s early days. The metric for the success of this will depend a lot on what Damascus does next. But as far as we are concerned at this initial stage, yes, absolutely, it was a success.”

Kassam asked if Gorka was surprised to hear critics of the administration claim the Syria strike was intended as a distraction from President Trump’s troubles.

“Having been in my current position for the last eleven weeks, I can believe anything,” Gorka replied with dry humor. He lamented “what this administration has put up with, in terms of utter, utter cynicism and politically motivated coverage of everything we do.”

“I say again, look at the speech made by our ambassador to the United Nations, and look at those photographs. It is unconscionable for anybody – I don’t care who you voted for on November the 8 – it is unconscionable for anybody to say we are making political theater out of the deaths and the injuries that happened on Tuesday.”

Gorka repeated that both the moral imperative and national security imperative dovetailed in President Trump’s action. “We have sent a very clear message: America is back, America is leading, and America will not be a feckless, spineless non-actor in the international community. Those days are over,” he said.

“We will be politically chastised, though, by those who do not recognize that we have a new administration,” he allowed. “So be it. We’re used to it.”

Kassam quoted Sen. Rand Paul’s (R-KY) assertion that President Trump should have come to Congress for authorization before attacking Syria.

“Just look at the last sixty years of presidential use of force,” Gorka countered. “This goes to a lot of the Breitbart readers. I want them to think about something for a second. Nothing has changed in the president’s policy to the use of force in international affairs. He said during the campaign, and he’s been explicit since he came into office, that he is not interested – this is not the second Bush administration. We are not interested in invading countries and occupying them. He understands why that is not a good idea and why fundamentally it’s un-American. We were born in rejection of imperialism, not to reinforce it.”

“This is not Gulf I, nor is this 2003,” he vowed. “This is a cruise missile strike against an air facility involved in a chemical attack on civilians. People need to understand that. This is not a full-throated war deployment. It is a surgical strike using missiles. I’d like people to think about that for a second. I understand the isolationist imperative, but weapons of mass destruction are in a very special category.”

Kassam countered that hearing any American president talk about military action to neutralize weapons of mass destruction produced a “sinking feeling in the pit of [his] stomach about what’s coming next.”

“How do you stop the train once it’s in motion? We know how these things work. We’ve seen them develop before,” he said.

Gorka responded, “I know the president, and I know what he thinks” about the slippery slope into larger actions of the Iraq War variety.

Kassam asked if he could guarantee Thursday night’s attack on the Syrian airfield was a “one-off.”

“Again, we don’t give our playbook away,” Gorka responded. “All I’m saying is I know the president, and I know his attitude to what happened in the last sixteen years. You can take that to the bank, my friend.”

Kassam asked if Gorka could offer assurances that the United States would not be drawn into a proxy war, or even direct conflict, with Russia.

“There’s absolutely no need to fear for any broader escalation,” Gorka said. “The Russian government will decide what it’s going to do next. It’s a sovereign state. But even when you have satrapies, even when you have client states, there comes a time when you have to decide whether it is in your personal interest to maintain that relationship.”

“I would say when that state, when that client, starts to use chemical weapons against its own populace, then the calculus changes,” he continued. “We understand the comments being made, but there is a point at which this kind of sponsorship is no longer in the interests of the sponsoring state. We are completely confident that we have this in the category in which it’s going to stay.”

Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that Democrats who opposed the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as America’s next Justice are “Godless” and “lawless.”

“What I think about it is: Psalms 14:1 makes a clear, concise statement, and the statement is a fool says in his heart there is no God,” Robertson said in the exclusive interview when asked about Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats planning to try to block confirmation of Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. “These people are Godless. And if you’re Godless, then you’re lawless—you practice lawlessness. Everyone who sins breaks the law. In fact, sin is lawlessness—that’s the Biblical definition of lawlessness.”

The interview, which took place before Senate Republicans blasted through the Democrats’ filibuster with the nuclear option ahead of a final confirmation vote on Friday—which is expected to succeed—was part of a wide-ranging conversation with Robertson on the Trump presidency, the institutional left, and the Gorsuch confirmation. Robertson said:

So what you have on the one side is lawless people such as Chuck Schumer and these radical activists on the Supreme Court—judicial activists—and it scares the daylights out of them to have a man who still thinks it’s worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God. Romans 1, Verse 28 says because they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a depraved mind to do what ought not to be done. And there’s a list of attitudes and deeds and it reads something like this—this is off the top of my head, but it’s pretty close—it says ‘you give them over to do what shouldn’t be done, to a depraved mind, he said, they become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They become full of murder, envy, strife, malice, and deceit. They are insolent, arrogant, and boastful. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters…’ It goes through the list and it ends by saying they’re ‘senseless, faithless, heartless and ruthless—they invent ways of doing evil.’ Therefore, that’s the one side of individuals—if you can imagine that—that’s what they’re like, the group that have formed this block against Judge Gorsuch, a guy who thinks it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God. If you think about it, the Ten Commandments are hanging just above the Chief Justice’s head and the reason the Founders said ‘I’ll tell you what boys, when you get to the Supreme Court hang the Ten Commandments over their head’—what the Founders were trying to get people to see then and we’ve lost sight of now, is there is a gigantic difference between the Supreme Court, men being in positions of judging, there is a gigantic difference between the Supreme Court by man and the supreme being, who loves us all. You understand what I’m saying? They hung the Ten Commandments over their head to say ‘don’t forget God in your judging, don’t forget God in your decisions’ because all the Founding Fathers—literally all of them, they went right on down the line. You lose your virtue, that’s Chuck Schumer. When you lose your virtue, your religion leaves, your morality leaves, and the last thing to go is your freedom. Well, we’re on a path here and that’s why it is critically important to get a God-fearing man—a man who is at least conscious of God—on the Supreme Court. Got to have it, or this thing is fixing to implode.

Robertson also said that Gorsuch did “remarkably well” in his confirmation hearing, despite the fact that the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were aggressively trying to undermine his chances at confirmation. He went on:

My view, and I’m just viewing the proceedings—the hearing—and it had the feel about it, you had a sheep or a little goat and you are surrounded by wolves. And I mean it was like, or another way I could put it is, you had one man of virtue—which is the pool of men fitted to the virtuous category is becoming smaller in each coming decade in my opinion. General moral excellence, right thinking, goodness, meritorious, excellence in general, effective power in force, moral strength, courage—that’s the Gorsuches of the world. And the last thing we need—it’s far better to have a good devout Catholic like Justice Scalia or a devout Episcopalian like Gorsuch than a lawless left-winger on the Supreme Court of all places. So if we’re not careful here, if we don’t get Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, judicial tyranny will reign without mitigation to no end. So we are really hanging on the edge of a precipice. We came within a hare’s breath of this leftwing bunch, these lawless fools, we came within a hare’s breath of them taking over the entire country with this last election. But I personally think, they asked me ‘Phil, what do you think? Who do you think’s going to win?’ I said, ‘We have one shot. The shot is, if the Almighty—he’s worked through all kinds of people with character flaws before—I said if the Almighty wants Donald Trump in there, oh he’s going in. That’s all I have to say.’ Well, all the pundits and all the political operatives and all this bunch and the polls—they factored in everything and everybody but God Almighty. And Lord behold, good ole Trump did get in there and I have no problem with his policies from a Biblical standpoint at all.

Robertson praised the Senate Republicans for going nuclear and beating the Democratic filibuster.

“Without hesitation, whatever it takes,” Robertson said when asked if he would go nuclear to get Gorsuch confirmed. “You know, Harry Reid is the one who dreamed it up to fulfill his little agenda at the time. Well, we ought to just go ahead and take him up on his deal that he made. Yeah, I’d do it. I’d do the nuclear option in a second.”

Robertson also said that there’s “no doubt about it” that President Donald Trump’s nomination of Gorsuch to the Supreme Court was the most important thing he could do as president of the United States. He added:

No doubt about it, but you’re looking at—and there might be some more that come up—but you’re looking at the next 30 years barring some kind of unfortunate early death or something but you’re looking at 30 years of the country and if you could stay that long, maybe the Almighty will have given us time to repent. America needs to repent back to God and bow down at his feet. I’m more into eternal healthcare than the stuff they’re arguing about now with Obamacare and all this stuff. I want America to invest in eternal healthcare by doing two things: love God and love their neighbor, and just do what is right. So my thinking is vet everything through the Bible and there will be no problems at all, so with Judge Gorsuch he’s a devout Episcopalian. I’ll take a devout Episcopalian over a lawless left-winger any way you want to slice it.

More from the Robertson interview is forthcoming.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4bc52329:1203a58:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday the Senate confirmed Neil Gorsuch as the 113th justice of the Supreme Court, thus making good on President Trump’s pledge to use SCOTUS to save the Second Amendment from “people like Hillary Clinton.”

Gorsuch was confirmed by a vote of 54 to 45.

Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign Trump promised that he would act to protect the Second Amendment. And during an October 9 presidential debate, he said:

I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. …People that will respect the constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important–also, the Second Amendment which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.

The nomination of Gorsuch was very much viewed as the nomination of someone who would be a justice “in the mold of Scalia.” Gorsuch’s exchanges with gun control Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) confirmed this.

Breitbart News reported that Feinstein used the opening day of the Gorsuch confirmation hearings to push an “assault weapons” ban and talk about how important she thinks it is to get “military-style assault weapons off our streets.” On day two of the hearings, Feinstein pressed Gorsuch to voice support for more gun control, and he responded:

Heller makes clear that we judges are to apply. The question is whether it’s a gun in common use, for self-defense–and that may be subject to reasonable regulation. That’s the test as I understand it. There’s lots of ongoing litigation about which weapons qualify under those standards. And I can’t pre-judge that litigation sitting here.

Unhappy with the response, Feinstein continued to press, but Gorsush said, “Whatever is in Heller is the law and I follow the law.”

Gorsuch’s comments and subsequent confirmation to the Supreme Court come after the left has spent years trying to keep Heller alive for the purposes of reversing or at least tweaking it if, by chance, a liberal president could successfully nominate a liberal justice. Notably, the Los Angeles Times and New York Times have reported on the Heller decision in a way that keeps it teed up for SCOTUS, should a liberal justice have replaced Scalia.

Gorsuch marks an end to hopes that Scalia’s replacement will reverse Heller.

It should be noted that the Supreme Court was the prize in the 2016 presidential election, and this is why NRA executive VP Wayne LaPierre endorsed Trump by assuring gun owners that a Hillary Clinton court and administration would be nothing less than an extension of an Obama court and administration. After Trump won the election, The Hill quoted UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, who said, “Trump will fill Scalia’s spot” and “That’s 30 years of votes against gun control.”

The government of North Korea sent a “message of greeting to Bashar al-Assad” on Thursday meant to congratulate Assad for “the 70th anniversary of the [Baath Arab Socialist] Party’s founding.” North Korean state media published the congratulatory note on Friday, following the Trump administration’s decision to conduct airstrikes on a key Assad military base.

“Kim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea, Thursday sent a message of greeting to Bashar Al-Assad, president of the Syrian Arab Republic who doubles as regional secretary of the Baath Arab Socialist Party,” the North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported on Friday.

“Today the Party is resolutely struggling to courageously shatter the vicious challenge and aggressive moves of the hostile forces at home and abroad and defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity under the leadership of Bashar Al-Assad,” Kim, the dictator of North Korea, is said to have written to Assad.

The South Korean news agency Yonhap noted that observers see the note as “showing friendly ties between Pyongyang and Damascus” in a particularly volatile political moment for Assad, as President Donald Trump approves of using American military strength to punish the Assad regime for an alleged chemical weapons attack in Idlib province, which left hundreds of Syrian civilians dead or injured.

North Korea’s ambassador to Moscow also weighed in on Trump’s airstrikes specifically, threatening a “most ruthless blow” against the United States should the United States exercises “even the smallest provocation” against Pyongyang, a sign that North Korea interpreted the attack on Syria as a warning to other rogue states like itself that America was not afraid of military responses to international human rights law violations.

In addition to the litany of human rights offenses the communist regime in Pyongyang has been accused of, Yonhap notes that North Korea keeps close ties to Syria and “has long been suspected of cooperating with Syria over nuclear programs.”

Trump ordered the airstrikes Thursday night while hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. China is North Korea’s biggest trade partner and a fellow Communist nation many accuse of not doing enough to curb Kim’s erratic and belligerent foreign policy.

Trump praised his discusses with Xi on Friday as “outstanding” and announced that the two world leaders had made “tremendous progress” on a host of issues. “I believe that lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,” Trump declared.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed with reporters that Trump and Xi had discussed North Korea. “We are hopeful that China will find ways to exercise influence over North Korea’s actions to dismantle their nuclear weapons and their missile technology programs,” he told reporters.

North Korea’s message to Assad on Friday was particularly notable for the timing of Trump’s airstrikes, but it was far from the first time Pyongyang has reached out to Damascus. A month ago, Rodong published a story reporting on a senior North Korean official sending “a message of sympathy to Bashar al-Assad” to express “the firm belief that the Syrian government and people would eradicate the aftereffects of the recent incident as soon as possible and firmly defend the security and stability of the country.”

Kim Jong-un personally sent a “message of greeting” to Assad that month, extending “firm support and solidarity to the Syrian government and people in their just struggle for frustrating the aggression and challenges of the hostile forces.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4b69eaa6:1180f8b:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C.–Democratic lawmakers have responded with mixed reactions to President Donald Trump’s decision to carry out military strikes on a Syrian air base that was the site of a chemical attack on Syrian civilians this week.

Approximately 59 Tomahawk missiles targeted Shayrat Airfield near the Syrian city of Homs.

“I support the administration’s strike on the air base that launched the chemical attack. I hope this teaches President Assad not to use chemical weapons again,” Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) wrote on his Twitter feed:

I support the admin’s strike on the air base that launched the chemical attack. I hope this teaches Assad not to use chemical weapons again. — Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) April 7, 2017

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) praised the strike but chided Trump for not consulting with Congress before carrying it out:

Making sure that Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do. It is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it. I salute the professionalism and skill of our Armed Forces who took action today.

Please see my statement following the US military strike in Syria: pic.twitter.com/MmiFY1LNxS — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) April 7, 2017

The chemical attack killed least 72 civilians. Many of the victims included small children.

Part of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s statement read, “Tonight’s strike in Syria appears to be a proportional response to the the regime’s use of chemical weapons.” She also sounded off on the president’s decision to proceed without Congress, saying, “If the President intends to escalate the U.S. military’s involvement in Syria, he must come to Congress for an Authorization for Use of Military Force which is tailored to meet the threat and prevent another open-ended war in the Middle East.”

However, in a follow-up letter, she implored House Speaker Paul Ryan to “call the House back in session immediately to debate any decision to place our men and women in uniform in harm’s way.” She added, “As heartbreaking as Assad’s chemical weapons attacks on his own people was, the crisis in Syria will not be resolved by one night of airstrikes.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan called the strikes “appropriate and just“:

Earlier this week the Assad regime murdered dozens of innocent men, women, and children in a barbaric chemical weapons attack. Tonight the United States responded. This action was appropriate and just. These tactical strikes make clear that the Assad regime can no longer count on American inaction as it carries out atrocities against the Syrian people. Resolving the years-long crisis in Syria is a complex task, but Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable and his enablers must be persuaded to change course. I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort.

While the strikes were lauded as a stark change from six years of inaction on Syria under former President Barack Obama’s administration, some Americans expressed opposition to the move fearing it might provoke another ground war.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) said, “It angers and saddens me that President Trump has taken the advice of war hawks and escalated our illegal regime change war to overthrow the Syrian government.” She added, “This escalation is short-sighted and will lead to more dead civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia—which could lead to nuclear war.”

Progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) used the occasion to push for greater admittance of Syrian refugees into the United States. “The Syrian regime must be held accountable for this horrific act, and its actions underscore why the United States should embrace innocent people who are fleeing in terror.”

Friday at the Annie’s List Annual Houston Luncheon, former 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton addressed President Donald Trump’s missile strike on Syria in response to that country’s alleged use of chemical weapons.

Referring to Trump’s position against America accepting refugees from Syria, Clinton said, “The action taken last night needs to be followed by a broader strategy to end Syria’s civil war. And to eliminate ISIS strongholds on both sides of the border. So I hope this administration will move forward in a way that is both strategic and consistent with our values. And I also hope that they will recognize we cannot in one breath speak of protecting Syrian babies and in the next, close America’s doors to them.”

The Trump administration is committed to overhauling the tax code this year, according White House Economic Advisor Gary Cohn.

Cohn said that overhauling the tax code is one of the top priorities for the Trump administration in 2017, claiming specifically that they have spent an “enormous amount” of time discussing the topic.

“I don’t know if it’s August or not,” Cohn said in an interview Friday morning on Bloomberg TV. “Getting it done well and getting it done right is more important than getting it done soon.”

Cohn, who serves at the head of the National Economic Council, claims that Congress will work on putting together “one cohesive” tax plan when it returns from recess in late-April.

Trump’s aides have insisted that, unlike the failed effort to repeal Obamacare, the tax code rewrite will be driven by the White House.

President Trump claimed he would introduce a “phenomenal” tax plan at the outset of his presidency but has yet to do so, leading some to believe that there is an internal debate over portions of the new code, such as the controversial border-adjusted tax, which would enact a tax on companies’ domestic sales and imported goods.

National pro-life leaders are celebrating the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as a huge “win for the pro-life movement.”

The Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) is featuring a photo of President Donald Trump’s letter to pro-life leaders, expressing his gratitude for their efforts to confirm Gorsuch to the Supreme Court:

Here&apos;s the letter @POTUS sent us thanking Susan B. Anthony List members for taking action to #ConfirmGorsuch #ProLife pic.twitter.com/yGVG2FEfz7 — Susan B Anthony List (@SBAList) April 7, 2017

Congratulations to our new Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch &amp; thank you @POTUS for nominating him! #ProLife #ConfirmGorsuch 🎉🎈🍾 pic.twitter.com/JueQyLe6bE — Susan B Anthony List (@SBAList) April 7, 2017

The Senate’s vote to confirm Gorsuch comes one day after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to change the procedural rules of the chamber and end the Democrats’ filibuster of Trump’s nominee.

“The swift fulfillment of President Trump’s commitment to appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices is a tremendous win for the pro-life movement,” said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement. “Susan B. Anthony List has been rallying the pro-life grassroots behind Judge Gorsuch’s nomination for months, including rallies in seven states where pro-lifers came out in force to urge their Senators to confirm Gorsuch.”

Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life, also applauds Gorsuch’s confirmation:

We were pleased to support Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, as were our grassroots activists from across America who sent thousands of messages to their Senators in support of his nomination. We thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for remaining steadfast throughout this process and President Trump for keeping his promise to the American people in nominating a pro-life Justice to the Supreme Court.

In exit poll reporting in November, CNN observed that 70 percent of voters said appointments to the Supreme Court were important to their vote, with 56 percent of Trump voters stating they were the most important factor.

Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, also hailed the Senate’s vote to confirm Gorsuch.

“Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation is Exhibit A for the argument that advocates for life and religious liberty need to vote,” said Pavone. “Without the active participation of social conservatives in last year’s elections, today we would be looking at a Supreme Court dominated by extreme pro-abortion justices. Instead, there’s great hope for the future.”

Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said the Supreme Court vacancy after the sudden death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia “became a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election.”

“President Trump made history by telling voters who he would appoint to the Court by providing a list — the American people chose him and he in turn chose from the list, keeping his promise,” Perkins added.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said Gorsuch’s confirmation is “a huge win for the Trump administration and for the pro-life movement.”

“Students for Life commends President Trump for keeping his promise to appoint a judge in the mold of the late Justice Scalia, and we look forward to the day when abortion on demand, in all nine months of pregnancy is no longer the law of the land,” she said.

Maureen Ferguson, senior policy adviser with The Catholic Association, said Gorsuch’s confirmation will help to correct the “alarming erosion” of the First Amendment right to practice one’s faith without discrimination.

“Senate Republicans have restored the true tradition of confirming justices without filibusters and the hyper-partisanship of recent years,” she added.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4ab407c2:108d5ff:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) argued that while “the president as commander-in-chief can’t order a direct military operation, a finite operation in time,” “Anytime we send our young men and women into harm’s way, I think the president owes it to the American people to come to Congress and present a plan.”

Lee said, “Anytime we send our young men and women into harm’s way, I think the president owes it to the American people to come to Congress and present a plan. You know, the Constitution, with good reason, says that in order to declare war, you have to go to Congress. We want to hear what the president’s plan is, and have the ability to debate it in front of the American people.”

He added, “[T]hat’s not to say that the president as commander-in-chief can’t order a direct military operation, a finite operation in time, but within a very short period of time, the president’s expected to come to Congress, present a plan, Congress really should declare war, or authorize the use of military force.”

Lee also stated that it was difficult to say whether the strike was a good idea at the time because “The president has access to information the rest of us don’t have. So, it may well be proven out in time that he did the right thing. I just don’t know. We just don’t have all that information.”

When asked if he would support a presidential authorization of a no-fly zone, Lee responded that “I’m not enthusiastic about the idea in the abstract, but if he came with the right plan, and I thought that plan could work, I’d consider it, especially if he can tie it up with American national security.”

A survivor of an Aug. 21, 2013 Sarin gas attack on his village called “Moadhamiyeh” in West Damascus, Syria told Breitbart News he is grateful for President Donald Trump’s strike against the Syrian military, which is a complete turnaround from President Barack Obama’s puzzling acceptance of President Bashar Assad and his regime.

“I want to tell President Trump with all my heart: Mr. President, as a Syrian and as a chemical weapon survivor, I want to thank you for taking action against the dictator, who has been killing us for more than six years,” said Kassem Eid, who spoke to Breitbart News from his home in Germany.

Eid was the subject of a 2015 60 Minutes report by Scott Pelley.

The chemical attack was delivered by missiles from Damascus, he said.

“My heart stopped as I was helping people. I was in a coma. My body was placed next to a bunch of dead bodies,” he said.

“Fortunately, my friends saw me move slightly and they called over a doctor,” he said. “They gave me more Atropine and gave me CPR and washed my body over and over with water until I came back as conscious.”

Before the chemical attack, the Syrian air force was bombing the town, he said.

“Suddenly, I started to hear strange sounds,” he said.

“They were the missiles coming from Damascus,” he said. “After two years of shelling and bombardment, you get to know which type of weapon you are getting hit with. This noise was a new and strange voice. The missiles were flying a low distance to the ground, like a small air jet flying off the ground. A few seconds later the missiles hit the ground and they did not make an explosion.”

Everyone was expecting an explosion, so everyone was confused, he said.

“I was looking from the window to see what was going on and I lost my ability to breathe,” Eid said.

“I felt my chest set on fire. My eyes were burning. I had an unbearable feeling of pain all over my body and my stomach. I couldn’t scream or do anything to alert my friends. I started beating my chest. That was my normal reaction to beat my chest as hard I can to get a single breath,” he said.

“Then, the neighbors started waking up screaming. Everyone was screaming. I went downstairs and went out and saw what I could only describe as Judgement Day,” he said. “There was panic and terror, but not a single drop of blood.”

Eid came to America after his village was attacked to tell Congress and the American people what was happening in his country. In 2014, he quit his activism in the United States and focused on Europe.

Beginning in 2011, Eid and his neighbors were under constant barrage, in addition to the one chemical weapon attack, he said.

“I survived more than two-and-a-half years of life under siege and bombardment by the Assad regime,” he said. “We had to survive on eating rats for more than a year, because of the government-enforced siege–the daily bombardment by tanks, planes, mortars.”

Eid said people in his village were part of the original uprising against the regime in 2011, before the emergence of the Islamic State when the armed force protecting his village was not tied to a religious or cultural faction.

“The local fighters were from our own town, most of the officers were defectors who refused commands to shoot at peaceful protesters,” he said. “They were students and teachers and some of them were even doctors–normal people, who just wanted to defend themselves.”

During the fighting, when the Syrian Army was pressing to invade the village, there were brutal crimes, such as rapes, burning individuals alive, and gutting people with knives, he said.

Assad’s crimes were deliberate, so he could manufacture a refugee crisis that would force the Western governments to negotiate with him, he said.

“I think Obama made a terrible mistake by not punishing Assad and not making sure, 100 percent, that Assad delivered all of his chemical weapons,” he said.

“Obama was very easy on Assad in a way that raised a lot of questions and a lot of–I don’t know–doubts about the true intentions of leaving someone like Assad–committing such horrible crimes–unpunished,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4a856276:f38967:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee told reporters he was proud to have shepherded the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch through to his Senate confirmation Friday, which ended the era of filibustering Supreme Court nominations that Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) began 16 years ago.

“There are a significant events that brought us to this point of adding a new member to the Supreme Court, but I think we just witnessed one of the most important votes that a member of the United States Senate can cast. Judge Gorsuch will be an independent voice on that Supreme Court. He proved that very much during the hearings,” said Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA).

The Senate approved President Donald Trump’s Gorsuch nomination 54-45, with Vice President Mike Pence presiding not so much because he was concerned there would be a tie, but because he and the other senators seem to enjoy his presence in the chamber.

The real fight was not the vote on the nomination, but whether to end debate and hold the vote at all.

Until Thursday, Senate rules required a 60-vote threshold to end debate and proceed to a nomination of a Supreme Court justice. That rule was challenged by the Republican majority and dismissed by the Republican majority.

Grassley said the dismissal of the 60-vote requirement returns the Senate to where it was before Democrats began the practice of blocking appointments with the filibuster, the practice of keeping debate open by holding on to a bloc of at least 41 votes.

Senate Democrats used the filibuster and the threat of a filibuster to jam up the judicial appointments of President George W. Bush beginning in 2001, and Senate Republicans followed suit for the appointments by President Barack Obama. In July 2013, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) challenged the use of the filibuster for any and all presidential appointments, except for Supreme Court justices.

“Those Democrats in 2001 poisoned the well that got us where we are,” Grassley said.

“It is up to Sen. Schumer, who started this whole slippery slope in 2001, to drill a new well that is not going to be poisoned. There will be both Republicans and Democrats to help him,” he said.

“Bottom line? It brings us back to where the Senate was from 1789 to 2001, when there wasn’t consideration of filibustering judges.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4a856276:f38963:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

China’s state newspaper The Global Times published an editorial criticizing President Donald Trump’s decision to conduct airstrikes in Syria, suggesting it was made “in haste,” but also observed that Trump appears to want “prove to the world that he is no ‘businessman president.&apos;”

As the Communist Party of China controls the content of the Global Times, its editorials are often interpreted as unfiltered opinion from the government itself, often significantly more belligerent than the diplomatic statements out of China’s Foreign Ministry.

“The US military attack on Friday took place despite no definitive results from the investigation by an international organization, and was carried out in the absence of a UN Security Council resolution. The Trump administration wasted little time in striking its targets, marking a stark contrast with its predecessor,” the Times observed.

“The US’ decision to attack the Assad government is a show of force from the US president. He wants to prove that he dares to do what Obama dared not,” the article continues, referring to President Barack Obama’s declaration that using chemical weapons was a “red line” after Assad was accused of using them, but not issuing any military response to the act.

Trump, the Times concluded, “wants to prove to the world that he is no ‘businessman president’ and that he will use US military force without hesitation when he considers it necessary.”

The article concludes that the strikes themselves “leave an impression that the decision was made in haste and are not without contradictions.”

President Trump announced late Thursday that he ordered the launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian army airbase believed to house the equipment used for an alleged chemical weapons attack in Idlib province. The Pentagon issued a statement confirming that the objective of the strikes was “to deter the [Assad] regime from using chemical weapons again.”

The Global Times response to the strikes differed significantly from the official Chinese Foreign Ministry statement. Spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters that Chinese officials “oppose the use of chemical weapons by any country, organization or person for any purpose and under any circumstance” and that China “supports relevant UN agencies in carrying out independent and comprehensive investigations into all uses or suspected uses of chemical weapons and, on the basis of solid evidence, reaching a conclusion which can stand the test of history and facts. We have noted the latest developments.”

While emphasizing support for a “political solution” to the Syrian Civil War, Hua refused to answer whether China considers Assad’s regime “the sole legitimate government in Syria” and did not directly criticize the U.S. airstrikes, instead stating, “the Chinese side always opposes the use of force in international relations.”

President Xi Jinping is currently meeting with President Trump in Florida, on a visit scheduled long before the escalation of affairs in Syria.

Trump reportedly said of their meeting, “I think, long-term, we are going to have a very, very great relationship and I look very much forward to it,” predicting “lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.”

According to the Chinese state news outlet Xinhua, Xi invited Trump to visit China and enjoyed “in-depth, friendly and long-time conversation” with Trump.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4a856276:f38962:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Jo Becker and Matthew Rosenberg report in the New York Times that President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner omitted mention of his meetings foreign government officials when he filed his security clearance paperwork.

From the New York Times:

When Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, sought the top-secret security clearance that would give him access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded secrets, he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years.

But Mr. Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months. They include a December meeting with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, and one with the head of a Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, arranged at Mr. Kislyak’s behest.

…

In a statement, [Kushner’s lawyer Jamie Gorelick] said that after learning of the error, Mr. Kushner told the F.B.I.: “During the presidential campaign and transition period, I served as a point-of-contact for foreign officials trying to reach the president-elect. I had numerous contacts with foreign officials in this capacity. … I would be happy to provide additional information about these contacts.” No names were disclosed in that correspondence.

Pamela Geller, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative , joined SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily. The conversation began with her thoughts on the previous night’s airstrike against Syria.

“I’m deeply concerned. I don’t understand it,” Geller said. “It seems like a knee-jerk reaction. It doesn’t speak to a coherent policy. It seems to me that Trump has switched sides.”

LISTEN:

“It does seem that way,” Kassam agreed. “This is what I’ve been saying for now the last 48 hours: there seems to be a malign influence on him. He’s saying things like, hey, we can get you really good coverage. CNN will stop writing ‘Trump’ on its chyron, they’ll start writing ‘President Trump’ on its chyron. Time magazine will put you on the front, and this time it won’t be scary or a joke. We’ll make you look like a leading statesman around the world. All you have to do is compromise on every single thing you said during the campaign.”

“Yeah,” Geller said with a rueful laugh. “I mean, I’m laughing, but I’m laughing with blood. It’s not funny.”

“I don’t know when he began to care. I mean, that was the beauty of Trump. For those of us that have been in the trenches, you have to become inured to this kind of withering criticism. You have to develop a crocodile skin. He seemed to have it. He seemed to have come to the party with it. It was really sort of the most fantastic thing about him,” she said.

“On the one hand, I always console myself with, ‘It’s not Hillary.’ That’s always my mantra. It’s my religion,” she said. “But this really, I think, is a terrible mistake. Back in 2012, my organization American Freedom Defense Initiative, issued a call to President Obama and to the United Nations warning of an impending genocide in Syria. I’ve been acutely aware of what’s going on in Syria. They did nothing, and millions of Christians and religious minorities were slaughtered. I don’t understand this visceral response. And what is the objective? Who are we partnering with? What quote-unquote ‘rebel gang’ – is it al-Nusra? Which al-Qaeda satellite are we partnering with?”

She shared Kassam’s skepticism about the size of the truly “moderate” rebel force in Syria, and whether Western intelligence services could identify real moderates and work with them effectively. Kassam noted ISIS, al-Qaeda, and the other “real, real enemies” of the United States were celebrating the attack, and asked what conclusions should be drawn from it.

“It tells us that we don’t know what we’re doing there,” Geller replied. “I don’t know what we’re doing there. I understand the quote-unquote ‘humanitarian,’ but I’m always first and foremost concerned about national interest. What is the national interest of this for us?”

“Look, Obama gave Syria to Russia. He did. He gave it to Russia, and so this could very well escalate into something truly unforeseen,” she warned. “I just think the United States should have taken action in a comprehensive, and logical, and strategic way years ago. Right now, it’s just a huge catastrophe, and what’s he doing? Is he putting a finger in the dam? I don’t think so. I don’t even think it’s that. Is it just this action?”

Geller stressed that it was President Barack Obama’s policies that led to this moment.

“He turned Syria over to Russia, and so this could escalate to World War III, and for what? For Syria? Seriously?” she said.

“My concern is that like President Bush, President Trump has two factions warring with each other. In the case of President Bush, it was Rumsfeld-Cheney-John Bolton, the hawks as it were, versus the trimmers, versus the RINOs like Colin Powell, Condi Rice, Hadley Burns,” she judged. “And the trimmers always win, because it seems like the safe bet. It seems like the quote-unquote ‘extremists’ are taking it a step too far.”

“But the fact of the matter is, it’s the trimmers that get you into trouble, because you can’t have a bold policy, you can’t go after a bold policy limp-wristed,” Geller warned.

“I’m concerned about McMaster, who is just another one who denies the motivating ideology of the terrorists,” she said of President Trump’s National Security Adviser. “He says jihad terror is not Islamic. This hampers our ability to respond to terrorism effectively. You can’t defeat an enemy that you don’t understand.”

Geller and Kassam found this a contradiction of Trump’s campaign promise to speak forthrightly about the dangers of radical Islamic terrorism.

“He promised to deal effectively with the terrorism problem and call it Islamic,” Geller recalled. “This is exactly what Obama and Hillary refused to do. McMaster represents a defeat for the Trump promise to drain the swamp. It’s a retreat from his stated goals. Believe me, it pains me to say this. It gives me no pleasure.”

“And Mattis, that ‘terrorism defames Islam’ – what book are they reading?” she added. “Are they not reading the Koran? I mean listen, just because you talk about it this way doesn’t mean that all Muslims are terrorists. But we don’t have to pat on the back every Muslim that doesn’t want to kill us.”

“Do you think Jared Kushner or Dina Powell has ever read the Koran cover-to-cover? Do they understand the enemy?” Kassam asked, referring to President Trump’s son-in-law and deputy national security adviser for strategy, respectively.

“No, I think Kushner’s a Manhattan liberal. That’s what I think,” Geller replied. “And I think that he may be a very smart kid, but that’s got nothing to do with the price of eggs in China. I think that he has undue influence. I think that’s why you’re seeing these moves with the settlements in Israel, the quote-unquote ‘two-state solution,’ inviting these Palestinian terrorists into this country…”

Kassam interjected to suggest adding Ivanka Trump’s reported meetings with Planned Parenthood to the list.

“Yes, this is Kushner. I don’t know how much we’re going to have to lose before Trump gets back on track. He’ll have to get back on track, because we’ve suffered under these failed policies, for the past really 15 years,” Geller said, quoting Albert Einstein’s famed admonition that “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result” is the definition of insanity.

In response to President Donald Trump’s order for airstrikes on dictator Bashar al-Assad’s military assets in Syria on Thursday night, the Bolivian government asked for a closed emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the developments.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, warned the South American nation – run by leftist President Evo Morales, whose government is allied with Assad – that if it has plans to defend Assad’s “atrocities” it would not do so behind closed doors.

“This morning, Bolivia requested an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the events in Syria,” Haley said. “It asked for the discussion to be held in closed session.”

“The United States, as president of the Council this month, decided the session would be held in the open,” Haley said.

“Any country that chooses to defend the atrocities of the Syrian regime will have to do so in full public view, for all the world to hear,” Haley said.

Trump ordered a cruise missile strike against a Syrian regime military airbase in response to a chemical weapons attack carried out by the Assad regime this week that killed dozens of people, including children. Images of dead and dying children posted online sparked outrage around the world.

The U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk land attack missiles last night, targeting the Shayrat Airfield located in the Homs Governorate in Western Syria, Pentagon officials said.

“The strikes were intended to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again,” Pentagon Spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said.

Davis said the airstrikes targeted aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers, and air defense systems and radars.

Davis said the military strategy is to avoid any human casualties and that Russia and “many countries” were warned ahead of the missile strikes.

In remarks explaining his actions, Trump said, in part:

Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where a chemical attack was launched. It is in the vital, national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council.

During a White House briefing with the king of Jordan, Trump seemed to indicate he would take action against Assad’s regime, stating that the chemical attack had crossed “many, many lines, beyond a red line — many, many lines.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4a1cc451:fb69f8:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In an effort to combat “fake news,” Google has launched a new feature on their search engine titled “Fact Check” which adds a label to certain links indicating whether they have been confirmed by partisan fact-checkers Snopes and Politifact.

Mashable reports that this new fact-checking feature was already implemented in some countries in October of 2016 but will now be rolled out globally in multiple languages. Now when you search for a news item, you should see results with a tag that states which claim is being fact-checked, which organization did the fact-check, and a summary of the story’s credibility with a “true” or “false” rating.

This feature will also be implemented on Google News, where news articles will be deemed true or false by Snopes and Politifact. Google has also stated that due to the nature of the system, some search results may return conflicting ratings depending on which organization fact-checked the story.

Google has listed a number of rules for publishers to follow if they want to be included in the program. Google will also only include publishers who are “algorithmically determined to be an authoritative source of information”.

Google also stated in their blog post, “As we make fact checks more visible in Search results, we believe people will have an easier time reviewing and assessing these fact-checks, and making their own informed opinions.”

Breitbart has detailed why partisan websites such as Snopes and Politifact are unqualified to judge what constitutes “fake news.” However, many large tech companies such as Google and Facebook are turning to the partisan organizations to determine what should be considered fake news despite the organization’s extremely poor track record of accuracy and basic moral decency.

In July of 2016 Politifact attempted to fact-check the grieving mother of a Benghazi victim who spoke at the RNC. When President Trump stated that Hillary Clinton wanted “open borders,” PolitiFact deemed his statement “mostly false,” despite the fact that Clinton herself admitted as much in a private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013.

“My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders,” she said at the time. Snopes fact-checker David Emery let his obvious partisanship be known in December of 2016 when he asked if there were “any un-angry Trump supporters” and tweeted, “Incredibly, some people actually think they have to put words in Trump’s mouth to make him look bad.”

Google and Facebook have now appointed these organizations to act as the arbiters of truth in the digital age with little oversight from any governing body whatsoever.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b49e24885:f758fe:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had some tough words for Russia on Thursday on the matter of Syrian chemical weapons.

Speaking from President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where Trump is meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Tillerson referenced Russia’s 2013 agreement to oversee the destruction of Syria’s chemical arsenal and said Russia has “clearly failed in its responsibility” to eliminate those weapons.

“Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,” he said.

Tillerson stated that Russia’s permission was not sought for the strike, but warnings were given to reduce the risk of Russian casualties.

“Our target in this attack was not Russia. Our target was this airfield and the Syrian regime.”

He also said the White House consulted with American allies in Europe and the Middle East, and their response was “overwhelmingly supportive.”

“I think it does demonstrate that President Trump is willing to act when governments and government actors cross the line,” Tillerson said of the U.S. military action. “It’s clear that President Trump made that statement to the world tonight.”

NBC News notes that Tillerson is scheduled to fly to Moscow next week “for high-level meetings with Russian officials on a trip originally intended to turn a new page in the U.S. Russian relationship.” With masterful understatement, a senior State Department official said the Syrian situation was certain to “color” Tillerson’s talks.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov provided some of that color on Friday, by stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin “considers the U.S. strikes against Syria an aggression against a sovereign country violating the norms of international law, and under a trumped-up pretext at that.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b49d50b25:f5bca8:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Friday during the U.N. Security Council’s session on Syria, Russia’s deputy U.N. envoy Vladimir Safronkov said President Donald Trump missile strike on Syria in response to that country’s alleged use of chemical weapons was an “act of aggression,” which will “only facilitated the strengthening of terrorism.”

Safronkov said via a translator, “On the night of the 7th of April, the United States attacked the territory of sovereign Syria. We describe that attack as a flagrant violation of international law and an act of aggression. We strongly condemn the illegitimate actions by the U.S. The consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely serious. This attack was a flagrant violation of the 2015 memorandum on preventing incidents and ensuring security during our operations in Syrian airspace and the ministry of defense of Russia has stopped its cooperation with Pentagon under that memorandum.”

He continued, “Of recent times the United States administration has often talked about combat international terrorism and this was just — this justified American troops and their allies being present on Syrian territory. Although they were there without the invitation of the legitimate government of Syria and without the approval of the security council of the United Nations. Manipulating articles of the United Nations charter beyond any criticism. The aggression by the U.S. has only facilitated the strengthening of terrorism. The attack came against Syrian armed forces structure and its air force. That is against those who over all these years have been combatting terrorism. It’s not difficult to imagine how much the spirits of these terrorists have been raised after the support from Washington.”

The government of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has condemned U.S. airstrikes on a Syrian airbase in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack by Assad troops that killed dozens of civilians, including children.

The U.S. response, Assad’s military argued, make the United States a “partner” of the Islamic State and other jihadi groups.

“The United States of America committed a blatant act of aggression targeting one of our air bases in the Central Region with a number of missiles, leaving 6 people martyred and a number of others injured and causing huge material damage,” the General Command of the Army and the Armed Forces of Syria said in a statement published on state news broadcaster SANA.

“The attack, the statement added, makes the United States of America a ‘partner’ of ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra and other terrorist organizations that have sought since day one of the unfair war on Syria to attack points of the Syrian army and the Syrian military bases,” SANA reported. “Jabhat al-Nusra” is the former name of the Sunni Islamist militia that was once the military arm of al-Qaeda and Syria and has since split.

President Donald Trump ordered the launch of 59 Tomahawk land attack missiles at a Syrian army airbase late Thursday, a response to a Syrian military operation this week that initial reports claimed had killed and injured hundreds of civilians in Khan Sheikhoun, Idlib province. The Syrian attack targeted a Sunni opposition stronghold and appeared to involve the use of chemical weapons.

The U.S. response, the Pentagon clarified Thursday, was “in response to the Syrian chemical weapons attack April 4th in Khan Sheikhoun. … That attack killed and injured hundreds of innocent Syrian people, including women and children.”

The Syrian government has responded to the U.S. attack by claiming that the Tomahawk missiles also hit civilians in a nearby village, though American officials have insisted that the attack targeted Syrian military assets – the assets believed to have been used in the alleged chemical attack – and that proper deconfliction measures were taken to avoid striking areas populated by Russian soldiers.

Assad’s two most-prominent allies, Iran and Russia, have responded similarly to Trump’s military order, accusing the United States of aiding the Islamic State by opposing the use of chemical weapons on civilians, banned by international law.

“As the only recent victim of mass use of chemical weapons (by [former Iraqi dictator] Saddam [Hussein] in the ’80s, Iran condemns use of all WMD (weapons of mass destruction) by anyone against anyone,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif posted on Twiter. “Not even two decades after 9/11, US military fighting on same side as al-Qaida &amp; ISIS in Yemen &amp; Syria. Time to stop hype and cover-ups.”

Contrary to the implication in Zarif’s tweet, the Syrian Civil War is not being fought between only the Assad regime and the Islamic State, but among a host of militias that include Kurdish factions, Christian defense units, and al-Qaeda fighters who split with the Islamic State.

President Trump justified the attack as a warning to Assad that the United States would not permit the flagrant violation of international law. “Years of previous attempts at changing Assad’s behavior have all failed and failed very dramatically,” the President said in a statement Thursday night. “Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that the attack was necessary to prevent Assad from “normalizing the use of chemical weapons” and blamed the Russian government for being “complicit” in the chemical weapons attack or “incompetent” to stop it. Moscow had guaranteed the world that Assad had rid his military of its chemical weapons stockpiles during the Obama administration.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b49d50b25:f5bca4:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Deadspin, a sports site, took time away from sports to attack President Donald Trump and the U.S. military after Trump ordered an air strike in Syria. The site was triggered by the U.S. military sending out photos showing it is doing its job, and apparently hinted that the photos are “propaganda.”

The April 6 entry was essentially a “breaking news” posting, revealing that President Trump had launched an air strike on a Syrian air force base during the evening.

The post featured official announcements and the president’s comments on the air strike from Mar-a-Lago.

But, along with the real news, Deadspin added that the “Syrian war” is propaganda and then went on to post a few tweets showing the U.S. military’s missile strikes.

In a separate report, the sports site elaborated on the “propaganda,” slamming CNN’s James Marks by calling him a “war propagandist.”

In a piece headlined, “CNN War Propagandist Promotes Syrian Attacks: ‘This Is Not Like Kentucky Basketball’,” Deadspin writer Tim Burke slammed Marks as being “excited” for a war in Syria.

Resident CNN war flack James “Spider” Marks excitedly promised an extended war against Syria, as the visibly engorged retired U.S. Army major general contrasted tonight’s use of more than 50 Tomahawk missiles against John Calipari’s Kentucky basketball program, stating that “this is not […] one and done.” Of course not. The sum of money paid to Karl-Anthony Towns to this point ($13.5 million) would only pay for eight Tomahawk missiles.

The site also featured a piece entitled, “We’re The Only Ones Who Can Stop This War,” and another called, “How Six Years Of Civil War Led To The U.S. Bombing A Syrian Airfield,” two more articles devoid of any connection to sports.

Sports news must not be something Deadspin is much interested in these days.

Hollywood celebrities took to Twitter Thursday to weigh in on the airstrikes in Syria authorized by U.S. President Donald Trump in retaliation for an earlier chemical weapon attack by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.

While many of those celebrities who reacted to the strikes condemned the president and called him a “hypocrite,” a number of stars reacted with both shock and sadness.

Actress Kerry Washington wrote simply that she was “heartbroken,” while actress Lena Dunham turned to prayer.

Below is a sampling of Hollywood’s reaction to the American airstrikes in Syria.

Thursday’s nuclear option vote restores 200 years of Senate practice, going far beyond Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation to restore the proper constitutional balance for Supreme Court and federal court appointments.

On April 6, the U.S. Senate voted 52-48 to extend Senate Democrats’ own precedent to guarantee that Supreme Court nominees can be confirmed with a simple-majority vote of 51 out of 100 senators. As an immediate result, Gorsuch was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice Friday morning by a bipartisan vote of 54-45, but the benefits to the Republic will last for decades.

Article II of the Constitution vests the power to appoint judges jointly between the president and the Senate. From the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 until 1987 (same digits, but in a different order), judicial nominations followed a particular pattern. The president takes the lead by nominating anyone he wants. Then the Senate either approves or disapproves of that choice by an up-or-down confirmation vote.

Their roles were always different. The president would consider every aspect of a nominee, including whether the nominee reflected the president’s philosophy on how to understand the Constitution, the law, and the role of the courts in America’s democratic republic.

The Senate’s role was more limited. The Senate does not pick the nominee; instead it was a check on the president so that, as Alexander Hamilton explained in The Federalist Papers No. 76:

To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.

In other words, the Senate would ensure that the president did not choose someone on an improper basis, such as because that person was a family member, or a good friend, or perhaps the president owed the nominee money.

In practical terms, that means the Senate traditionally looked to three objective criteria to determine if a nominee was fit for office: education, experience, and character. So long as a judicial nominee satisfied those requirements, the Senate would respect the president’s prerogative. That was why Justice Antonin Scalia—whose seat Gorsuch will now fill—was confirmed in 1986 by a vote of 98-0, despite his crystal-clear record of being very conservative.

But then the very next year, something unprecedented happened when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork, who might have been even more qualified for the Supreme Court than Scalia or Gorsuch, as extremely qualified as those two men were. (Bork was a former U.S. solicitor general, Yale law professor, one of the greatest legal scholars in all of American history, and a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.)

Democrats took control of the Senate in the 1986 midterm elections, and it had become an article of faith in that party to protect sacred cows leftists were getting from a liberal Supreme Court that they could not get through the ballot box, like abortion on demand, racial preferences, and militant secularism.

In 1985, Attorney General Ed Meese declared that the official constitutional philosophy of the Reagan administration was originalism: In our democratic republic, the only legitimate way for unelected, politically unaccountable judges to interpret the law (and especially the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land) was according to the original meaning of its provisions, leaving it to the American people alone to decide whether the Constitution or lesser laws need to be changed or amended.

Reagan and Meese made good on that philosophy when Reagan elevated Scalia to the Supreme Court. With Bork—who was even more conservative than Scalia—nominated to the Court, the Left saw the possibility of an eventual Supreme Court majority that would destroy their decades-long march to achieve their agenda without earning the votes of the American people.

Consequently, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) led the charge to destroy the unbelievably well-qualified Bork, purely because Bork was an unapologetic conservative who openly explained his judicial philosophy. The Democrat-controlled Senate voted down Bork’s nomination. That seat on the Court eventually went to Anthony Kennedy.

Several years later it almost happened again. Justice Clarence Thomas was narrowly confirmed, 52-48.

Republicans tried to restore the constitutional balance. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed 96-3 in 1993, despite being as clearly very liberal as Scalia, Bork, and Thomas were clearly conservative. In 1994, Stephen Breyer was confirmed 87-9.

But Democrats would have none of it. When the very well-qualified Samuel Alito was nominated, he was confirmed in 2006 by a vote of 58-42. To avoid a double-standard, this new baseline started to impact how Republicans voted on Democratic nominees, as seen in the confirmation votes of Sonia Sotomayor (68-31) and Elena Kagan (63-37).

But the Left did not stop at the Supreme Court during these years. When George W. Bush was elected president, Senate Democrats in 2001 narrowly controlled the Senate 51-49, and began refusing final floor votes on Bush’s nominees to the federal courts of appeals. As an example, they refused to vote on the nomination of John Roberts to be a judge on the D.C. Circuit appeals court.

The American people did not tolerate this, and gave Republicans control of the Senate in the 2002 midterms.

Now in the minority, Democrats decided to double-down. One first-term senator, Chuck Schumer (D-NY), persuaded most of his colleagues to begin filibustering nominees they did not support, even when some Democrats were willing to join with the Republican majority to confirm them. Roberts got through to the D.C. Circuit anyway, but others—like Miguel Estrada, another nominee to the D.C. Circuit—were blocked.

As Republicans continued to gain seats in the Senate, Democrats considered taking things to still another low. They decided against filibustering Roberts’s nomination to the Supreme Court, but tried to do so on Alito. But that was a bridge too far for many Democrats at the time, which is why cloture was invoked on Alito 72-25, even though many of those Democrats who voted for cloture then voted against his final confirmation on the up-or-down vote, resulting in 58-42.

Finally with Gorsuch, Schumer led Democrats to claim the role of co-appointers of federal judges, merging filibusters with final confirmation votes. If a Republican president nominated someone whom Democrats would not have nominated (which presumably would be the case 100 percent of the time), Senate Democrats would not only vote against final confirmation, but also vote against cloture, regardless of qualifications.

Under the historical standard, President Donald Trump’s nomination of Gorsuch is a slam-dunk. Education? Undergraduate degree from Columbia, law degree from Harvard, and even a doctorate from Oxford. Experience? Law clerk for the U.S. court of appeals and for the Supreme Court, then a partner at a prestigious law firm, also U.S. deputy associate attorney general, then finally a federal judge for more than ten years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Character? Impeccable honesty and integrity, as well as being a good husband, father, and member of his community, and known to be a gracious, humble, and respectful gentleman.

Because it takes 60 votes to invoke cloture, for the first time in American history putting cloture and final passage on the same level created a 60-vote threshold for confirmations, meaning that without 60 votes for both, a nominee would be filibustered. Unless Republicans would consistently hold a 60-vote supermajority on the Senate, it became possible that a vacant Supreme Court seat could conceivably remain unfilled for a full presidential term.

Critics insist that Schumer’s hypocrisy here was shameless, because during the Obama years, when Democrats narrowly held the Senate, for a while Republicans followed the Democrats’ new standard, and filibustered a couple of President Barack Obama’s nominees.

Crying self-righteous indignation, in 2013 Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Pat Leahy (D-VT), and Schumer created a parliamentary ruling that the filibuster rule, Senate Rule XXII, did not apply to any presidential nominees, except that the ruling did not explicitly cover the Supreme Court. During this time, Schumer gave a passionate speech about how preventing an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees was profoundly undemocratic, and an assault on the constitutional order.

So Democrats created that precedent on November 21, 2013, one that did not address the Supreme Court simply because there was no Supreme Court vacancy at the time. During the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton’s running mate and Senate Democrats publicly declared that when they won the White House they would immediately extend their ruling to cover the Supreme Court.

Consequently, jaws dropped when Schumer declared with righteous indignation that denying a minority the right to filibuster by insisting on an up-or-down vote was profoundly undemocratic, and an assault on the constitutional order. This was the same time that Senate Democrats made clear that virtually every senator who opposed Gorsuch’s confirmation would also oppose cloture, solidifying a 60-vote threshold for judicial nominees from Republican presidents.

This ultimate double-standard and the warping of the constitutional framework was the last draw, which is why on Thursday Republicans ended the madness. They highlighted the fact that this was purely a response to what the Democrats had done, by phrasing the procedural issue as whether “the precedent of November 21, 2013,” applied to Supreme Court nominations. By a vote of 52-48, senators issued a “judgment of the Senate” that the Democrats’ own rule applies here, abolishing the remaining judicial filibusters.

Now the Republic goes back to where it stood for roughly 200 years. Elections have consequences. When the American people give the presidency and the Senate to opposing parties, they have the choice of picking comprise candidates (if there is such a thing these days) or of keeping seats open. When the American people speak with one voice to give the same party control of both the White House and the Senate, then it should be no surprise that they are able to get judges who reflect that unified philosophy on the federal judiciary at every level—including the Supreme Court.

President Donald Trump appeared energized by the ongoing meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, hailing “tremendous progress” in the relationship between the two countries.

Trump did not detail specific agreements or topics of discussion, but used a number of superlatives to describe the “outstanding” relationship.

“I believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away,” he said, calling it a tremendous honor to host the Chinese president at his estate at Mar-a-lago.

Prior to the meeting, Trump signaled that it was time for China to get tough with the increasingly hostile North Korea.

“If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you,” Trump said in an interview with the Financial Times earlier in the week.

Trump demonstrated he was willing to use military action to back up his rhetoric, ordering a cruise missile strike on Syria just before having dinner with the Chinese president last night.

The Senate voted just before noon Friday to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Nation’s highest bench.

The vote, originally set for Friday evening, was moved up to the morning after Democrats agreed to waive part of the final debate period. Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s pick to replace conservative anchor of the Court, Justice Antonin Scalia, was confirmed by a vote of 54-45, with Democrats Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) joining a unanimous Republican Caucus.

Judge Gorsuch’s nomination process was among the most contentious in American history. After assembling the pledges of 41 Senate Democrats to iniate the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) sought to prevent a vote of the full Senate. This set up a showdown over Senate cloture rules that resulted Thursday in Republicans invoking the “constitutional option” and abolishing the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.

The partisan animosity of the nomination continued into the vote. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), representing Gorsuch’s home state, voted against his fellow Coloradan. He had previously sought to chart a middle path, voting at least to allow a vote of the full Senate before the constitutional option was used.

Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) took to the floor immediately after confirmation to thank his staff for their work throughout the momentous proceedings.

The Senate moved on to invoke cloture on President Trump’s pick for Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.

Gorsuch is now expected to be formally sworn in on Monday and will join his eight fellow justices in an investiture ceremony to be held later this month.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b493edfbd:e369d7:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has expressed concern over “supporter and friend” U.S. President Donald J. Trump’s decision to approve the launch of 60 U.S. Tomahawk missiles on Syria’s Shayrat air base in south-east Homs.

“I have to say, I woke up to this news this morning very, very surprised. And I think a lot of Trump voters will be scratching their heads hard and asking, ‘where does this go from here?’” said Mr. Farage Friday morning, speaking on the LBC radio network.

The MEP told presenter Nick Ferrari: “I’m a Trump supporter and friend, and one of the things that I think helped him gain votes was the idea that we shouldn’t endlessly get involved militarily in the Middle East without fully thinking through the implications of what we’re doing.

“I think back to Libya a few years ago and, unarguably, we’ve made the world worse as a result of our intervention.”

Pointing out that his platform of non-interventionism was one of the president’s key selling points during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, Mr. Farage said the world “could have done with more certainty” over the situation in Syria before the U.S. launched airstrikes.

Other figures in the UK have taken to Twitter to express their dismay at the bombing, with current UKIP leader Paul Nuttall saying he “hoped for better” from President Trump.

The U.S. bombing of Syria last night was rash, trigger happy, nonsensical and will achieve nothing. I hoped for better. — Paul Nuttall (@paulnuttallukip) April 7, 2017

And UKIP backer Arron Banks highlighted a tweet made by the U.S. president in 2013, which insisted America should “stay out” of Syria, and called the recent decision to launch airstrikes “stupid”.

U.S. senators such as Lindsey Graham and John McCain, who have repeatedly criticised Trump’s populist platform, showered praise on the president for ordering the strike in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack allegedly ordered by Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad.

But former House of Representatives member and presidential candidate Ron Paul argued that there is “zero chance” the Syrian president was to blame for the chemical attack, pointing out that “it doesn’t make any sense for Assad under these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gases”.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b493edfbd:e369d5:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Friday on CNN’s “New Day,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), the 2016 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told show host Chris Cuomo there was “no legal justification” for President Donald Trump’s action against Syria a night earlier, which was a military strike against a Syrian air base in response to the nation’s use of chemical weapons earlier in the week.

Kaine said although he agreed from a “moral standpoint” with the decision, there was no “legal justification” for Trump’s decision because he did not come to Congress first.

“There is no legal justification for this,” Kaine said. “I think from a moral standpoint — absolutely, I agree with Senator Rubio. It was the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do — to try to deter Bashar al-Assad from war crimes and remember, I voted to use military action against Syria in August of 2013. Senator Rubio voted against it back then when Bashar al-Assad did the same thing. But I said the president has to come to Congress. And Donald J. Trump, citizen Trump back then said exactly the same thing. A president has to go to Congress. He should not have done this without coming to Congress.”

Friday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) praised President Donald Trump for the missile strike on Syria in response to that country’s alleged use of chemical weapons.

McCain said, “I would not expect more strikes, but I would hope that we would reinvigorate our support for the Free Syrian Army, the establishment of a no-fly zone, and move forward. This is important, and it is an important signal, but it is the beginning of a departure from the failed policies of the last eight years, and you’re not going to repair that overnight.”

“The other point that I would like to make really quick is that the President showed me that he has trust in what I believe is the strongest national security team assembled,” he continued. “I was not sure, frankly, whether he listened to them or listened to others. I think it is very clear that he values their advice and counsel, and this action is a result of the collective wisdom of some of the wisest people I have known.”

Jennifer Higgins, the recently named associate director of the Refugee, Asylum, and International Operations Directorate (RAIO) of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), is another Obama holdover at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) President Trump can remove.

Higgins is a protege of Lori Scialabba, the former acting director of the USCIS. Prior to her sudden resignation in March, Breitbart News identified Scialabba as the number one Obama holdover at DHS President Trump could “fire or remove” because of her open defiance of his first travel ban order and her long record of intervening down the chain to personally assist refugees from Iraq, some of whom were not approved through formal channels.

RAIO is the part of DHS with primary responsibility for vetting refugees who are resettled in the United States under the Refugee Admissions Program authorized under the Refugee Act of 1980.

The improvement of the refugee vetting process was a key theme during President Trump’s campaign. Trump specifically instructed DHS to identify ways to improve the current refugee vetting process in both Executive Order 13769 and Executive Order 13780. Though key elements of both the initial and revised travel bans have been temporarily struck down in several federal courts, the refugee vetting task force has remained in effect.

Though the outgoing Scialabba arranged to have Higgins promoted from her previous official job as deputy associate director at RAIO to associate director there (without open competition for the position), Higgins has not actually done any work for the RAIO job for which she has been paid since early 2016, sources familiar with the operations of DHS tell Breitbart News.

Higgins is, however, working for DHS. She is currently engaged “on detail” in the department’s headquarters.

Prior to her 2016 “detail” to headquarters, Higgins had a long history at RAIO, where by 2011, she served as deputy chief of the Refugee Affairs Division, one of three within RAIO.

“The Refugee Affairs Division provides resettlement benefits to people who are outside their countries and cannot or are unwilling to return to their homes because they fear serious harm,” according to the USCIS website. The other two divisions at RAIO are the Ayslum Division, which “manages the U.S. affirmative asylum process,” and the International Operations Division, which “with offices around the world, is the face of USCIS abroad.”

During that time, she “was 100 percent supporting the Obama administration in meeting their refugee targets. She browbeat employees to meet the Obama refugee targets,” a source familiar with the operations of DHS tells Breitbart News.

Now, with the new administration, she “has changed her spots and is now portraying herself as an ally of the Trump administration. General Kelly is ill-served having her at Headquarters.”

The unusual employment arrangement that has benefited Higgins (who was paid more than $162,000 in 2015, according to public records) was apparently standard operating procedure at USCIS under Scialabba’s leadership.

“It has become common at USCIS under the Scialabba regime for people to not serve in the positions they are technically employed in,” a source familiar with the operations of DHS tells Breitbart News.

“While technically employed as the deputy associate director for RAIO for several years and, most recently, as the associate director for RAIO (through appointment by Scialabba, without competition), these two positions – originally as the deputy associate director and now as the associate director – have, in fact, been filled by a series of rotating personnel in 60-90 day sprints for the last three years,” the source adds.

The previous associate director, Joseph Langlois, who served until January 2017 was not really engaged in the job and managed it like “an absentee landlord since 2013,” the source adds.

“This ever changing cast of ‘leadership’ has caused significant instability in the program,” the source notes.

Higgins’ ‘detail’ to the Secretary’s office “was supposed to be six months, which started last spring (2016). As far as anyone can tell, she was originally trying to burrow into the Obama apparatus for a permanent position at the Department to advance her personal agenda – cozying up to the previous administration,” the source continues.

“Now it seems she has had a complete theological shift and is now trying to burrow into the permanent apparatus around General Kelly,” the source says.

“Currently, she is ’employed’ as the new permanent associate director, replacing Joe Langlois. If she does return, this will be the first time in a number of years that she has filled the role she is actually being paid for,” the source adds.

On March 31, James McCament was named permanent deputy director of USCIS, apparently about two months after Higgins received the title of associate director of RAIO.

“Until the nomination and Senate confirmation of our next USCIS director, McCament will also serve as acting director of USCIS,” the website says. McCament has been with DHS since its inception. “A founding member of DHS, he served first in the DHS Office of General Counsel from March-September 2003,” the website notes.

He subsequently served as “special advisor to DHS Secretaries Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff,” and from 2006 to 2008 “served as senior counselor to the director of USCIS,” all during the George W. Bush administration.

During the Obama administration, he “served as the chief of the USCIS Office of Legislative Affairs” and subsequently “served in the Office of the USCIS Director as acting chief of staff and acting deputy chief of staff.”

On February 22, Breitbart News identified Joanna Ruppel, at the time the acting associate director, Refugee, Asylum and International Operations, USCIS, DHS, as one of eight Obama holdovers at DHS President Trump could fire or remove:

The Refugee, Asylum and International Operations (RAIO) office at USCIS has been well known as a partisan advocate for promoting asylum to unqualified applicants since at least the 2000s when Lori Scialabba headed the office. “What USCIS has done through policy, not law, is they have made it impossible to deny asylum to people that gut feelings say is a bad guy,” a source in the Department of Homeland Security tells Breitbart News. Anyone at USCIS who has experience in that office is tainted by that record, and current Acting Associate Director Joanna Ruppel fits into that category.

In 2015, Ruppel received a Meritorious Executive award from the Office of Personnel Management, which said of Ruppel, chief of International Operations in RAIO at the time, “Ms. Ruppel’s accomplishments are marked by her commitment to serving the world’s most vulnerable populations and building a culture of organizational excellence.”

The DHS website offers conflicting information about who is currently running RAIO.

On one page of the current site, Ruppel, the acting associate director, is listed as the person in the USCIS leadership team who is currently leading RAIO.

On another page of the current site, Higgins, the “named” associate director, is listed as the person in the USCIS leadership team who is currently leading RAIO.

Breitbart News contacted the DHS press office for clarification on who is currently running RAIO but has not yet received a response.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4931de51:e298c8:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump’s decision to fire dozens of Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian air base Thursday evening, in response to the Assad regime’s alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians, was the commander-in-chief’s first major foray into war.

While the next steps remain unclear, several strategic and political consequences are already apparent.

The first is that “red lines” are “red lines” again. Whatever the pros or cons of Trump’s decision, he promised to take action, and he followed through. Trump thus restored American credibility in the international arena, while retaining the tactical element of surprise. The contrast to President Barack Obama is clear. America is safer for that alone.

Beyond that, there are several other consequences in the region and beyond, which are worth considering individually:

1. Syria/Iran. Last week, the Trump administration appeared to accept Bashar al-Assad’s permanence in power. That may have been a trial balloon, to see whether he would respond positively. When Assad allegedly accelerated his attacks instead, that sent a signal that he could not be trusted, and would not respect the White House for its tolerance. The new strategy is “regime change” — following the defeat of the Islamic State, which still remains the first priority.

But it is unclear what “regime change” means, how it would be done, and whether it could succeed. Syria is essentially a vassal of Russia and Iran, meaning that pushing Assad out would require a significant commitment of diplomatic and military resources. Direct conflict with Russia is unlikely — the Russians would trade Assad for a permanent presence in the country — but war with Iran is a possibility (and might be unavoidable with or without the U.S. attacking Syria).

2. China, North Korea. The most important strategic consequence of Thursday night’s attack was the message that it sent to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was seated at dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago while the Tomahawks were flying. Trump let the Chinese know that he is capable of taking pre-emptive military action and that he keeps his word. If China does not reel in North Korea, in other words, Trump will follow through on his commitment to go to war there.

3. Russia. Overtures aside, the Russians have been testing Trump’s resolve since he became president. (The supposed Russian collusion with Trump during the election remains, until proven otherwise, a myth embraced by Democrats for self-serving political ends.) The Russians took responsibility for disposing of Syria’s chemical weapons. Trump has let them know he expects them to uphold their end of the bargain and that there will be real consequences for negligence. He is not going to erase Russia’s strategic gains under Obama, but he is not going to watch them expand on his watch.

4. Islamic State. ISIS could draw two conclusions from Thursday night’s attack. On the one hand, Trump struck a blow against one of their enemies. On the other, he demonstrated a commitment to follow through on his military promises. Strategically, the attack is a wash — unless Trump can strengthen the international commitment to fighting ISIS as part of the effort to remove Assad from power. The world does not want to hand power to the medieval butchers of Raqqa.

One point remains unresolved, at least for skeptics of the war: whether the chemical weapons strike earlier this week was really a Syrian government operation, or a “false flag” aimed at provoking an American response. (Such tactics are not unusual in the Arab world, especially in the age of satellite television and social media propaganda.) It appears that the White House is confident in the intelligence linking the regime to the attack; it should share that, within reason.

5. Israel. Israel has been striking targets inside Syria for years, either when it detects weapons shipments to Hizbollah or when it is fired on by forces inside Syrian territory. What is most significant about Trump’s attack is that it partially restores the U.S. deterrent in the region and sends a signal to Iran that its nuclear program is no longer free and clear. In addition, the general applause with which America’s Arab allies have greeted the air strikes is a sign that Trump’s effort to bring the Sunni states together with Israel in a regional alliance against Iran and its proxies may be coming together.

6. Domestic politics. Democrats on Capitol Hill have offered cautious support for Trump’s actions; the usual anti-war suspects have condemned him. Some “NeverTrump” hawks have praised the president’s decision. The most interesting and important reactions have come from Trump’s own supporters, who are divided. Some are proud of their president’s strength — especially when contrasted to years of waffling and “lead-from-behind” indecision by Obama. Others are irate, reminding Trump that he promised them in 2016 he would not launch reckless wars to achieve “regime change.”

The ultimate political outcomes will depend on Trump’s success on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. Amidst the many opinions, it is useful to remember that anyone who is certain of anything in the Middle East is usually wrong.

The interior ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia is warning police officers to be prepared for potential stabbing attacks from sympathisers of Islamic State.

The report comes from an internal memo sent to police in the German region by the interior ministry. According to the memo, Islamic State has specifically called for knife attacks on police officers in Europe in the same style as the recent Westminster attack.

“The terrorists of the so-called Islamic State have been publishing videos for a long time in which supporters are called on to assassinate ‘unbelievers’,” a ministry spokesman said, reports Die Welt.

In one video published by the terror group, a policeman is shown being stabbed by an Islamic State fighter. The ministry says they have used the information to brief police on precautions to avoid potential danger.

They say the Islamic State video shows three ways to attack policemen and shows which knives, in particular, are the most effective. They tell the fighters specifically to distract the police so that they do not see the knife and are unable to defend against attack.

The videos were released by the propaganda arm of Islamic State known as “Amaq Agency” which is often the first outlet to claim responsibility for terrorist attacks committed by the group.

Fighters or sympathisers of Islamic State have stabbed police, often fatally, over the last year. Last year in the city of Hanover, a 15-year-old girl named Safia attempted to stab a police officer to death but was unsuccessful. Safia was put on trial for attempted murder and found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison.

In a suburb outside of Paris, another policeman was killed in his home by an Islamic State fighter last June. Forty-two-year-old police commissioner Jean-Baptiste Salvaing was killed by the terrorist along with his wife. After several hours a police commando unit stormed the house killing the murderer 25-year-old Larossi Abballa.

Police are not the only targets of Islamic State. Earlier this week, the group released a list of 8,700 Westerners that were targets of assassination including U.S. President Donald Trump.

In Germany and Austria, Islamic State has also targetted Muslims they feel are “too moderate” for murder labelling them as “apostates”. Amongst those listed was Aiman Mazyek, Secretary-General of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, and Vienna city councilman Omar Al-Rawi.

As I’m writing this on Thursday evening, American ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea have launched dozens of cruise missiles at the Shayrat Airbase in Syria. This airbase was chosen because it is believed that Monday’s nerve gas attack was launched from this airbase. The attack appears to the following the outline that I described in yesterday’s article, though it apparently caught some analysts by surprise that the military action occurred so quickly after the nerve gas attack. It’s not expected that this will be followed by a long series of further military actions. Washington Post

Philippines president Duterte orders military to occupy South China Sea islands

Philippines president Rodrigo R. Duterte on Thursday ordered the army to deploy troops to “nine or 10” unoccupied islands and reefs in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea that are owned or claimed by the Philippines. According to his televised announcement

The unoccupied, which our ours, let’s live on it. It looks like everybody is making a grab for the islands there, so we better live on those that are still vacant. At least, let us get what is ours now and make a strong point there that it is ours. “We try to be friends with everybody, but we have to maintain our jurisdiction, at least [in] the areas that we control I have ordered the armed forces to occupy all these islands and put up the Philippine flag to occupy all these. … This coming Independence Day [June 12], I may go to Pagasa to raise the flag. We want to make a strong point that that is ours.

Duterte also said “bunkers or houses and provisions for habitation” were to be built. Analysts are pointing out that this cannot be accomplished because the islands and reefs are too small. For that reason, some analysts are speculating Duterte would like to initiate reclamation activities to create artificial islands, as the Chinese have been doing, although that kind of reclamation is probably too expensive for the Philippines budget.

China has not yet commented on Duterte’s order, but is certain to express the usual furious outrage. China has claimed the entire South China Sea as its sovereign territory and has built artificial islands and military bases. However, these claims and activities that were declared illegal in a harsh ruling by the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in the Hague, in a case brought by the Philippines.

Philippines sends warship to Benham Rise to protect from China

Benham Rise is not in the South China Sea, but is east of the Philippines, and part of the country’s continental shelf. According to Philippines’ defense secretary Delfin Lorenzana:

The navy will henceforth regularly patrol Benham Rise partly due to past Chinese activities there but more importantly, because it is part of our continental shelf and awarded to us by the United Nations.

In 2012, the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf confirmed that Benham Rise is part of the Philippines’ continental shelf. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the continental shelf comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas 200 nautical miles (NM), or 370 kilometers, from a state’s baselines.

According to Philippines media, China has been surreptitiously exploring Benham Rise for several months, breaking international and Philippine laws in scouring the seabed and waters without permission. China claimed that vessels were there for “innocent passage,” but Chinese activities have turned out to have two objectives: First, to determine possible submarine hiding areas for future submarine warfare, and second, to determine through sound reflection and refraction possible oil and gas.

China’s activities in Benham Rise have incited a public furor, and may be the reason for Duterte’s orders to the army to occupy South China Sea islands. Philippine Star and The Rappler (Philippines)

TEL AVIV – Following the U.S. launch of Tomahawk missiles targeting a strategic Syrian airfield on Thursday night, Iran must be monitored carefully for the possibility that it may use its proxies for retaliation, especially against Israel’s northern border.

Following eight years of inaction on Syria under the Obama administration, President Donald Trump demonstrated last night that he is willing to hold Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to account, this time by striking the Shayrat Airfield near the Syrian city of Homs that was believed to have been utilized to carry out a chemical weapons attack that killed scores of civilians.

The U.S. airstrikes signaled to Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers that Trump will act in Syria and the administration strongly supports the removal of the Syrian president – an important strategic ally of Moscow and Tehran. The U.S. military move demonstrates to Israel and the Sunni Arab bloc cast aside by Obama’s nuclear deal with the mullahs that American leadership has officially returned to the region.

Assad himself is unlikely to retaliate since the last thing he wants amidst a years-long insurgency attempting to topple his regime is to go to war with Trump or expand the battlefield to U.S. ally Israel.

Trump’s bold authority in Syria directly threatens Russian interests since it was Moscow that largely filled the security vacuum in that country when Obama repeatedly failed to take any meaningful action against Assad. However, Russia’s direct response will most likely be confined to vocal protestation, such as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling the U.S. strikes “aggression against a sovereign nation” carried out on a “made-up pretext.”

President Vladimir Putin cannot risk a military confrontation with Trump and Russia is already signaling willingness to abandon Assad to come to a larger regional accommodation.

Still, there is the possibility that Russia may quietly support action by others, especially agents of a very nervous Iranian regime that has been preparing proxies for years who can heat up Israel’s northern border and beyond. Both Moscow and Tehran have reason for wanting Trump to pay a price for acting in their Syrian playground. The question is whether they will dare to respond, even tacitly.

And that brings us to Iran. Trump’s embrace of America’s traditional Sunni Arab partners at the expense of Tehran and his strong positions against the disastrous international nuclear agreement have been deeply concerning to the expansionist, terrorist-supporting Twelvers in Tehran. And while the removal of Assad from power would be a blow to Russia, depending on the ultimate outcome such a move could be disastrous for Iran’s position in Syria. Iranian Revolutionary Guard units have been fighting the anti-Assad insurgents alongside the Syrian military and the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia. Syria represents a key pawn in Iran’s geopolitical chessboard that stretches across the vital region.

In recent weeks, there have been strong indications that Iran has been seeking to arm its Hezbollah proxy with even more advanced weapons that can target the Jewish state. Last month, Israel took the unusual step of striking a Hezbollah weapons convoy near the city of Palmyra that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was transporting advanced weapons to the Iran-backed militia.

Israeli leaders and Hezbollah terrorists have in recent weeks ratcheted up war rhetoric, with Israeli officials warning that Hezbollah, which can only act at the direction of Iran, has been preparing for conflict.

Last Sunday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot warned the IDF would not hold back from striking Lebanese state institutions in a future conflict with Hezbollah. “The recent declarations from Beirut make it clear that in a future war, the targets will be clear: Lebanon and the organizations operating under its authority and its approval,” Eisenkot stated.

Hezbollah is not Iran’s only option. Breitbart Jerusalem has been reporting on the formation of a “Golan Liberation Brigade,” which was announced last month by the secretary-general of the Iraqi Harakat al Nujaba Shiite militia and is reportedly being trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The so-called militia is another Iranian front that could be used to target Israel’s Golan Heights at the behest of Tehran.

The next few days and weeks will be critical in determining Iran and Russia’s resolve in the face of an awakened America that has returned from its eight-year slumber.

The Jerusalem Post reports: Russia recognizes west Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, the Russian Foreign Ministry stated in a surprise announcement on Thursday.

The announcement comes as US President Donald Trump’s administration is agonizing over whether to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that would constitute recognizing west Jerusalem as the country’s capital. No other country in the world recognizes any part of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

The statement issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry reads, “We reaffirm our commitment to the UN-approved principles for a Palestinian-Israeli settlement, which include the status of east Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. At the same time, we must state that in this context we view west Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.”

Republican Senator hawks quickly praised President Donald Trump for ordering a strike in Syria last night in retaliation for the chemical weapons attack ordered by dictator Bashar al-Assad.

Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator John McCain, two of the biggest critics of President Barack Obama’s failure to act in Syria, issued a joint statement in favor of Trump’s decision.

“Unlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,” they said. “For that, he deserves the support of the American people.”

McCain and Graham urged Trump to consider further action, calling for a strategy to take out Assad’s Air Force, the establishment of safe zones, and supporting Syrian rebels.

“Building on tonight’s credible first step, we must finally learn the lessons of history and ensure that tactical success leads to strategic progress,” he said.

Senator Marco Rubio also supported the action.

“By acting decisively against the very facility from which Assad launched his murderous chemical weapons attack, President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over,” he said in a statement.

Rubio wrote on Twitter that Trump was “deeply moved” by the images of children suffering the effects of the chemical weapon attack.

“Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished,” he wrote, quoting Proverbs 11:21.

Senator Tom Cotton issued a statement of support as well.

“I commend President Trump for taking swift, decisive action against Bashar al-Assad’s outlaw regime,” he said. “Any country that violates arms-control agreements with the U.S., develops illicit chemical- or nuclear-weapons programs, or supports those countries that do ought to take note.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b487458c2:cd63d7:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Do you know anyone that wishes the Trump presidency was just a horrible nightmare caused by last night’s vegan meatloaf and that they will wake up to find Barack Obama is still their President? The bad news is they may have a tenuous grasp on reality, but the good news is they aren’t alone — Instagram has them covered.

According to The Atlantic, the Instagram page of Obama White House photographer Pete Souza has become an oasis of calm — a safe space if you will — for those poor souls too grief-stricken by the 2016 election of Donald Trump to do anything besides wish Obama was still their president.

In a strange way, it does make sense. Most liberals, except for the most diehard Hillary Clinton supporters, prefer Obama to Clinton, so it’s natural that the president of fantasyland for people posting #NotMyPresident on social media should be Barry and not Hillary.

Souza regularly posts Obama White House pictures to his account, even acknowledging when he posts non-Obama material, “I realize people want their daily Obama fix,” as quoted in The Atlantic piece. I wonder how many journalists visit his Instagram to fondly remember the good old days when they could print whatever the Obama administration sent them and not have to do real work?

Chris Matthews of MSNBC infamously said Obama gave him a “thrill up his leg” when speaking — do you think Matthews would lose that feeling so quickly? I’d wager there are as many journalists following Souza’s Instagram as there are millennials that never had to experience defeat in their coddled lives.

Speaking of the media, Souza may be auditioning for a gig in the mainstream media using the Instagram account. The Atlantic article details the way he takes digs at the Trump presidency through his Obama posts, such as complaining about the new White House drapes. Why isn’t he on CNN already?

Sadly, this trend of Obama supporters refusing to accept reality is not likely to change anytime soon, especially if the Trump administration is successful in changing many of Obama’s most cherished policy positions; leftists will dig in their heels over just who exactly is president. In other words, the irrationality is going to get worse in the coming months and years, not fade into obscurity. This will be exacerbated by Obama’s Washington, D.C., home acting as the nerve center of the anti-Trump resistance, with Obama and house guest Valerie Jarrett leading the charge against the current administration.

Pretending on Instagram that Obama is still POTUS is just the first step. Any day now we will start seeing Harry Potter fanfiction in which Mr. Obama is named Headmaster of Hogwarts. Some of it could be mistaken as being written by J.K. Rowling herself.

It won’t be surprising if the next Democrat primary becomes a race of who can appear the most Obama-like to energize a base that resorts to Instagramming about the former President. The Obama administration may have supported Hillary as the most qualified person for the presidency, but Democrat voters clearly disagreed. Being worthy of the Obama-loving Instagram crowd will be the most important qualification in four years. That is, of course, assuming that the next primary isn’t fixed.

Conservatives understand what Obama’s fans are dealing with to some extent; we did go through the eight years of the Obama administration. We didn’t create safe spaces to praise former presidents, though; we got on with our lives and worked to improve ourselves, our families, and our country. Hopefully, millennials, journalists, and other assorted Instagrammers can make the same choices moving forward.

President Trump’s decision to launch an airstrike against a Syrian airbase thought to be the source of Tuesday’s chemical weapons attack drew widespread approval from European leaders, who deemed the assault proportionate and justified.

On Thursday, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk missiles from two Navy destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea in response to the massacre of more than 80 civilians, including 28 children, allegedly through the illegal use of deadly sarin gas bombs. The target was al-Shayrat military airfield near Homs, believed to be the provenance of Tuesday’s nerve gas attack.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said the action was an “appropriate response” to the “barbaric” chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime.

UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon noted that the strike was a United States operation, “but let me emphasize again we fully support it.”

“This strike was very limited to one airfield, it was entirely appropriate, it’s designed to deter the regime from carrying out further chemical weapons attacks,” he said.

Similar remarks came from the European continent.

“President Assad bears sole responsibility for this development,” declared German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande in a joint statement Friday. “His repeated use of chemical weapons and his crimes against his own population had to be sanctioned.”

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called the attack “understandable” after the failure of the Security Council to come together in chastising Syria.

“The action Trump ordered tonight was a response to a war crime,” said Italian Prime Minister, Paolo Gentiloni, “a war crime under the responsibility of Bashar Al Assad.”

“Italy understands the reasons for U.S. military action proportionate in time and manner,” said Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, “in response to an unacceptable sense of impunity and as a deterrent signal to the threat of further uses of chemical weapons by Assad, following those already established by the UN.”

Elsewhere, Trump received support from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who Friday said the strike sent a “strong and clear” message that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.

“Israel fully supports President Trump’s decision and hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the Assad regime’s horrific actions will resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere,” Netanyahu said.

Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull said his government fully supported the strike, called the move a “swift and just response.”

“This was a proportionate response by the United States. It is not designed to overthrow the Assad regime,” he said.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe offered his full support for the U.S. strike, and noted that Japan “highly appreciates” the Trump administration’s commitment to maintaining global order and working with its allies at a time when “the threat from weapons of mass destruction is also growing more serious in East Asia.”

Russia predictably denounced the strike as an “act of aggression against a UN member,” warning that the move could end cooperation between the Russian and US military branches.

“Russia will demand an urgent UN Security Council meeting after the US airstrike on Syrian aviation base. This is an act of aggression against a UN member,” the Kremlin stated, adding that it was an act of “aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law.”

Iran, too, “strongly condemned the US strike” and suggested that the action would lead to increased terror activity.

“Iran strongly condemns any such unilateral strikes,” said foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi. “Such measures will strengthen terrorists in Syria… and will complicate the situation in Syria and the region.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has been the frequent target of criticism, at Breitbart News and elsewhere, as a stalwart of the Republican establishment who has often thwarted conservatives on Capitol Hill.

But today, McConnell has earned his place on the conservative honor roll for his part in saving the Supreme Court. Donald Trump deserves the lion’s share of the credit, for his improbable victory in 2016. But McConnell was key.

Last February, when Justice Antonin Scalia passed away suddenly, President Barack Obama relished the chance to replace him with a liberal judge and tip the balance of the Court decisively to the left.

In contrast to his two earlier choices, one of whom had no judicial experience whatsoever, Obama placed qualifications above identity politics, picking the highly-respected liberal judge Merrick Garland of the D.C. Circuit. He would have been confirmed easily.

But McConnell, who had conceded to the Obama administration over and over again, took the bold and risky step of preventing Garland’s consideration. He had a precedent in hand: the so-called “Biden rule.” As he said in the Senate:

The next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country, so of course the American people should have a say in the Court’s direction… The American people may well elect a President who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration. The next President may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy. Let me remind colleagues what Vice President Biden said when he was Judiciary Chairman here in the Senate: It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is central to the process. … The Biden Rule underlines that what the President has done with this nomination would be unfair to any nominee, and more importantly the rule warns of the great costs the President’s action could carry for our nation.

It was an argument for which President Obama had no answer.

Still, McConnell came under pressure from the media and the D.C. establishment, who had trusted him to evade the kind of gridlock he was now enforcing.

As the election drew nearer, and Trump’s chances seemed slim, some worried whether McConnell had made a catastrophic blunder. Hillary Clinton might have nominated Garland again — but then she might also have nominated someone much worse.

Through it all, McConnell held the line, understanding that the Constitution, and the nation’s future, were at stake.

This week, faced with a filibuster by Democrats that had nothing to do with the nominee, and everything to do with politics and revenge, McConnell dispensed with two centuries of tradition and ended the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. It could not have been easy to do for a man who venerates the Senate’s history and traditions — a fact that Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) used to taunt McConnell in Senate debate on Thursday.

McConnell did it anyway, clearing the way for Gorsuch to pass Friday’s confirmation vote by a simple majority. Democrats may soon have cause to regret wasting the filibuster on such an eminently qualified judge. Now President Trump has a free hand to appoint far more conservative judges to the Supreme Court — and there may be new opportunities sooner rather than later.

An essay by liberal attorney Thomas Geoghegan in the Washington Monthly reminds us of the fate America narrowly avoided. Lamenting the Gorsuch nomination, Geoghegan mourns the lost opportunity to install a liberal Court.

In a striking admission of how liberals really feel about the purpose of the Supreme Court, Geoghegan writes: “In a way, it’s discouraging to hear so many anti-Trump voices saying that we must defend the Constitution. I understand the sense in which they mean it, but the challenge for the left has always been not to defend but to change the Constitution.” And the changes Geoghegan envisioned included enforcing gun control and “fundmental” socioeconomic rights.

That is what McConnell prevented: a judicial coup, through which legions of liberal lawyers intended to impose their will by fiat.

Whatever other grievances conservatives have had with him in the past, or may yet have in the future, his role in preserving the Court and the Constitution will be the most important legacy of his Senate leadership.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson confirmed on Thursday night that President Vladimir Putin was not given advance notice of the United States’ decision to strike a Syrian target with missiles.

“No contacts were made with Moscow, with President Putin,” Tillerson told reporters during a briefing with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

He blamed the Russians for failing to prevent the use of chemical weapons in Syria, calling them “complicit or incompetent,” which is why the United States took action.

According to the Pentagon, Russian ground forces in the area were given a “deconfliction” notice prior to the attack.

Tillerson said that President Trump believed acting in this way against the Syrian regime was “appropriate” and proportional” and that the response from American allies was “overwhelmingly supportive.”

President Donald Trump ordered the launch of cruise missiles at an air base in Syria in response to dictator Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons against his own people. McMaster said that Trump authorized the strike after meeting with members of the National Security Council in both Washington D.C. and at his estate at Mar-a-Lago Florida.

According to the Pentagon, the strike targeted Shayrat Airfield in Syria in response to the chemical weapons attack on April 4. A total of 59 tomahawk missiles were launched from the Destroyers USS Porter and USS Ross in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.

“The use of chemical weapons against innocent people will not be tolerated,” said Pentagon Spokesman Captain Jeff Davis after the strike.

According to McMaster, the strikes did not target sarin gas storage units, but rather the airport and aircraft that were used to launch the chemical weapon attack.

“This was not a small strike,” McMaster said, adding that he expected a “big shift” if Assad’s understanding of when America would act.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b46798db3:980bdb:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON – Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul cautioned President Donald Trump about making war in Syria Thursday evening shortly after it was announced that the Pentagon fired more than 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles on a Syrian air base.

“While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked. The President needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution, and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate,” said Paul, who ran for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination against Trump.

“Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different,” he said.

Earlier Thursday, the senator told Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio he was skeptical about the President’s ability to change Syria with new attacks.

“If he decides to do something in Syria, he would come to Congress and ask for a declaration of war. Short of congress voting on it, I’m opposed to illegal and unconstitutional wars,” he said.

“I have the greatest amount of sympathy, I can’t see those pictures, it’s heartrending to see those pictures,” he said. “But going to war we have to decide will it be better or worse? Will we improve our national security? Are we threatened currently by Syria, and if we go to war is Assad likely to use less chemical weapons or more?”

Paul argued American attacks could make the situation in Syria worse.

“There’s some argument for the more cornered and the more defeated in some ways more likely they are to use chemical weapons and actually for the less defeated they are that they’re less likely to use them,” he said. “The bottom line is it’s horrific.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b46798db3:980bd9:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump ordered Tomahawk missile strikes against a Syrian airfield on Thursday evening — then sat down to dinner with visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago.

CNN, citing a White House source, reports:

Trump met with his national security team before his dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago Thursday, where he made the decision to pull the trigger on the biggest military action of his presidency, an administration official says. He sat through dinner with the President Xi as action was under way.

Trump was briefed after dinner by Secretary of Defense James “Mad Dog” Mattis, according to the report.

The message would not have been lost on the Chinese president, whose visit was expected to include difficult discussions about the threat of North Korean ballistic missiles, as well as about China’s ambitious naval expansion on artificial islands in international waters.

“He does what he says … He’s sending a message to the Chinese,” former General Jack Keane told Sean Hannity on Fox News.

“He’s telling the Chinese that, listen, the North Koreans are trying to weaponize intercontinental ballistic missiles and the rhetoric is they will use them against my country and my people. Don’t push me into a corner where I have to use a military option to deal with them. That would be horrific. That would mean war on the Korean peninsula,” Keane said.

“I think he’ll get the Chinese attention for sure, as a result of that. It’s not rhetoric. We’ve had rhetoric for eight years, with passivity, and no action.”

For those of us who waited four long years to see the United States reclaim its moral mantle as leader of the free world and protector of human rights, tonight’s news that President Donald Trump struck at the Syrian tyrant Bashar al-Assad is electrifying.

Who among us has seen the images of dead Arab children in Syria over the last few days, and not felt shaken to our core at the injustice of it all? Who among us has seen the frothing at the mouth of innocent men and women, attacked by Assad with Sarin gas, and wondered how the world can watch in silence? Who among us has not felt shamed and humiliated by our own impotence?

It is 2017 and people are still being murdered by poison gas with the world watching in silence. That, my friends, is an abomination.

And now, finally, the United States rises to the occasion and shows that human life has value. Those who devalue it will suffer serious consequences. Kill babies and you will be killed yourself. So you had better think twice before you drop those gas canisters.

We human beings are not God. We are not all-powerful. We are not omnipotent. We cannot punish every unrighteous iniquity. We cannot strike at every fiend. But we can punish the worst offenders so that others might take notice.

And if gassing children is not evil then the word has no meaning.

This past November, Trump won the election. But tonight he became the leader of the free world.

The President has elevated the value of Arab life in Syria, where more than half a million have already been murdered.

President Barack Obama disgraced himself and his administration by allowing genocide in Syria with absolutely no response. Worse was his Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, who had earned a global reputation for calling out previous American government officials as “bystanders to genocide” — only to become one herself.

The biggest sin of government officials like Susan Rice is not the alleged “unmasking” that currently pervades the news, but her allowing 1400 Arab civilians to die of a chemical gas attack by Assad on August 20, 2013 — and then, as National Security Adviser, doing nothing.

America is the light of liberty and the beacon of democracy. Those words ring hollow when America watches genocide and does nothing.

Tonight President Trump has helped restore America to its human-rights luster, and Arab life to the claim of infinite value that is the birthright of every child of God.

May God protect the innocent people of Syria and may God bless America.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b463898dd:87a809:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

During a statement on the missile strike on Syria carried out by the US, President Trump said that it is in the “vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.” And called on “all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types.”

Trump characterized Syria’s nerve attack as “very barbaric” and something that “no child of God” should ever suffer. that he characterized as an attack on “helpless men, women, and children.”

He added, “Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.”

Trump further argued that prior attempts to change Assad’s behavior “have all failed, and failed very dramatically.”

He further called on “all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types.”

On Thursday, following the publication of gruesome images of the victims of an apparent chemical attack on civilians, reports surfaced that President Donald Trump ordered a missile attack on a base in Syria.

The reports follows a week in which President Trump responded to an alleged chemical weapons attack by dictator Bashar al-Assad by noting it “crossed many red lines” and had changed his thinking on Syria.

The President refused to elaborate earlier in the week on how he would approach the six-year-old civil war and the sprawling web of armed factions fighting each other within Syria’s borders, likely in part due to the complex nature of the fighting. The Syrian Civil War is not being fought solely between Assad’s soldiers and anti-Assad rebels, but by a diverse cast of characters staking their territorial claims in isolated regions of the country, sometimes failing to interact with each other at all, and their patron nations looking to stake a claim in the heart of the Middle East.

At least ten major armed groups, including the armies of at least five sovereign nations, have entered the fray in Syria.

Governments:

Bashar al-Assad/The Government of Syria

The Syrian army is the official sovereign military of the country, run by dictator Bashar al-Assad. Experts began calling into question the military’s ability to handle a bonafide war as early as in 2003, when the Iraq War made some question whether the early Bush administration would see Assad as another Saddam Hussein. By 2011, when the Syrian Civil War began, it appeared unlikely that Assad would remain in power for much longer, with reports of army desertions by the tens of thousands.

An astute political mind, Assad reached out to international allies in Russia and Iran for help. While the United States poured its efforts into weakening Assad enemies like the Islamic State, Russia and Iran focused their help on subduing anti-Assad rebels in regions far from ISIS control. By the collapse of Aleppo in mid-2016, Assad appeared to be an unchangeable political reality in Syria – those who wanted him removed also feared creating another Libya, a terra nullis cradle for global jihad.

Assad, accused of using chemical weapons against civilians on multiple occasions, promised “no pause” in such attacks following the collapse of Aleppo in September. The next month, the United Nations accused Assad of bombing a school in Idlib, a rebel-held province. Today, Idlib is home to the chemical bombing that President Trump asserted has changed his thinking on intervention in the country.

Assad enjoys the support of Shiites and Christians domestically, who view him as a buffer to Sunni jihadist forces seeking to exterminate them.

Russia

S ince the early days of the Syrian Civil War, Russia made its support for Assad clear as a reliable veto on any UN resolutions condemning his government’s human rights abuses against its people. As the Syrian army began to lose ground to both rebel groups and the Islamic State, however, Russia’s involvement in preserving the status quo in Damascus grew, peaking with President Vladimir Putin eclipsing American counterpart Barack Obama by getting Assad to agree to relinquish his chemical weapons arsenal.

Russia later sent troops into Syria claiming its troops would be fighting against the Islamic State, not necessarily in defense of Assad. Russia’s aid in securing the collapse of Aleppo, a northern city with no known Islamic State presence, raised suspicions that Russia’s stated intentions were false. That plenty of evidence suggests Assad never gave up those chemical weapons added to the suspicion Russia involved itself not only to expand its international influence but to secure Assad’s leadership.

In addition to aiding Assad, the Russian military cooperates with the Syrian YPG forces (see below), placing them within “hand-grenade range” of American troops doing the same.

Iran/Hezbollah

As the largest Shiite nation in the world, Iran forged a natural alliance with Assad and his father, Syrian head of state Hafez al-Assad, both Alawite Shiite Muslims. As a longtime ally of the regime in Tehran, the terrorist organization Hezbollah has also involved itself in Syria, aiding the Assad military. Hezbollah has not only vowed to defend Assad, but to “continue to bear our great responsibilities of jihad there,” according to leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Iran, meanwhile, has declared Syria part of its growing empire. Iranian legislators have called Damascus one of “four capitals” of the “Islamic Revolution” in addition to Tehran, along with Sanaa, Yemen; Baghdad, Iraq; and Beirut, Lebanon.

Iran has been using the Syrian Civil War as a training camp for rookie soldiers and a dumping ground for Afghan refugees, forced to fight in Syria in exchange for small salaries or the promise of residence for their families in Iran.

Turkey

The Turkish government is the latest sovereign government to parachute into the fray. Turkey launched Operation Euphrates Shield in August 2016, allegedly to keep the Kurdish YPG (see below) from controlling more territory west of the Euphrates River. Yet Turkey’s motives for entering Syria have never been completely clear. Following the government’s claim that the move was meant against the YPG, Islamist President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkish troops were present in the country “to end the rule of the tyrant al-Assad who terrorizes with state terror,” a remark the Russian government found, to put it mildly, baffling.

The Turkish government has since walked back Assad’s comments, claiming Turkey entered Syria to fight the Islamic State, a stated goal that has nothing to do with Assad or the YPG. It has also since ended Euphrates Shield, but not withdrawn its troops, leaving open the question of what Ankara will do next.

America

Contrary to those who suggest a Trump administration in Syria would be the first major commitment of American troops in the country, the United States has been involved in the Syrian Civil War for years. Reports suggest that the CIA had begun sending weapons to anti-Assad rebels as early as 2012, even as Hillary Clinton referred to Assad as a “reformer” a year prior.

Most Obama administration involvement in Syria was on the part of the Free Syrian Army (see below), attempting to “vet” anti-Assad rebels to ensure that no American weapons fell in the hands of jihadists. Obama’s vetting program resulted in Free Syrian Army defectors abandoning the group en masse, feeling too small and vulnerable to fight alone, for groups such as al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front. By then, however, the U.S. was also working with the Kurdish YPG in the fight against the Islamic State (the YPG and Free Syrian Army largely operate in different parts of Syria).

The Trump administration initially appeared prepared to invest more in the relationship with the YPG to liberate ISIS areas. In March, a report suggested that the Trump administration was considering a troop deployment of up to 1,000 more forces.

Trump’s statements on Wednesday, however, following Assad’s allegedly chemical weapons attack on civilians in Idlib, raises questions regarding a policy shift from focusing on ISIS to actively working to remove Assad.

Militias/Terrorist Groups:

The Free Syrian Army (FSA)

The FSA, a coalition of anti-Assad, mostly Sunni rebels, has been the subject of much controversy in the American telling of the Syrian Civil War. President Barack Obama bet on the FSA as the most respectable of the anti-Assad militias, imposing a “vetting” process on the rebels to ensure that American weaponry did not fall into the hands of jihadist groups. The result of that vetting process was a significantly smaller FSA, a combination of members failing the vetting or simply deserting as they felt the group dwindling. By 2015, the Pentagon admitted that a number of “vetted” FSA members had handed their weapons over to al-Qaeda, the Nusra Front, or merely joined their ranks.

One FSA faction pledged allegiance to Islamic State Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

What is left of the FSA now relies on Turkey for its support, largely politically but with some reported military aid. The United States has largely shifted the focus of its support to the YPG.

The Kurdish Peoples’ Protection United (YPG/YPJ)

The YPG and its all-female brigade, the YPJ, are the military wing of the People’s Democratic Union (PYD), a Kurdish political faction in Syria advocating for the creation of a sovereign Kurdish state out of Syrian Kurdistan, or Rojava. They are widely considered the single most successful militia in fighting the Islamic State, and have cooperated with both the United States and Russia, sharing intelligence to allow precision airstrikes on ISIS targets. The YPG were responsible for the victory against ISIS in Kobani, on the Turkish border, that cut the supply of jihadis from the west into Syria.

Under the Trump administration, Syrian Kurds have said they felt fully supported in their fight against ISIS, and reports indicate they may play a large role in the operation to liberate Raqqa, the ISIS “capital,” despite its location far outside Rojava. The YPG do not appear particularly

While Marxist in ideology and sporting some ties (how strong they are is a matter of heated debate) with the U.S.-designated terrorist group Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), the YPG is largely pro-American and even boasts several American volunteer fighters. Western YPG volunteers receive funerals with high honors when they die fighting for the Kurds against ISIS.

The YPG opposes Assad only so far as it is seeking an independent Kurdistan, but has no overt interest in the Arab leadership of Damascus. Its main rivals on the ground are ISIS and the government of Turkey, as a Kurdish state would include some Turkish territory. Thus the two main factions supporting neither Assad nor ISIS in Syria refuse to work together, making U.S. diplomacy that much more complicated.

The Islamic State

The Islamic State was once al-Qaeda in Iraq, before al-Qaeda’s leaders severed ties with the group in 2014. At that point, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant, ISIS/ISIL. Upon declaring itself a sovereign state in Iraq and Syria, the group changed its name to the Islamic State.

ISIS remains the primary target of U.S. and Kurdish military activity in the region. The group has committed acts of genocide against Shiites, Christians, and Yezidis; destroyed museums full of priceless ancient artifacts as a protest against “idolatry;” forced an untold number of girls and women into sex slavery and slave marriages; and crucified, tortured, and brainwashed Sunnis, adults and children alike, as a mode of imposing its interpretation of Sharia law.

The Islamic State still controls Raqqa, Syria and Mosul, Iraq, but has lost much of its territory in the region. Meanwhile, it has expanded its reach into Libya, Afghanistan, the Philippines, and Europe.

Al-Qaeda/The Former Nusra Front

Amid early clashes between the Assad regime and Syrian rebels, al-Qaeda used Assad’s widespread unpopularity among Sunnis as a recruiting tool for its armed wing in Syria, the Nusra Front. The Nusra Front has since split from al-Qaeda, though many argue it has done so in name only. Nusra has expanded its focus of attack into rebel-held parts of the capital, Damascus, while al-Qaeda has begun branding itself as the flagship jihadist organization and expanding its influence into areas formerly held by the Islamic State.

Al-Qaeda has begun not only to capitalize on ISIS’s failures, but suck the oxygen out of the Free Syrian Army, as well. As mentioned above, the Obama-era alliance with the FSA resulted in mass desertions from the FSA to the then-Nusra. The soldiers who defected took their U.S. weapons with them. With the added manpower, reports suggest al-Qaeda’s allies in the country have begun to use the global focus on fighting ISIS to take over volatile territories no longer stably held by either Assad, ISIS, or the YPG.

Christian Militias

Christians are a minority in Syria, and among the most persecuted. Some have nonetheless attempted to form self-defense militias interested in keeping jihadist groups out of their towns. Among the largest Christian militias is the Assyrian Dwekh Nawsha (“self-sacrifice”), which operates against the Islamic State and jihadist groups in particular. Dwekh Nawsha agreed to join forces with smaller Christian fighting brigades late last year.

In 2015, reports suggested that the Assyrian Christian forces had managed a delicate agreement with Arab rebels and Kurdish militia fighters to all target the Islamic State. Christians are the targets of discrimination from Arab rebels, ISIS, and the Kurds, however, leaving them often to fight for their territory alone.

Christian militias have vocally pleaded for help from the United States, which has preferred investing in the Free Syrian Army and the YPG.

In addition to the well-known genocidal acts of ISIS, Christian groups allege that they are the victims of an ethnic cleansing attempt in Rojava. A year ago, Christian groups alleged that Kurdish fighters had attacked them in the traditionally Christian village of Qamishli.

As the Christian fighters are largely preoccupied with combatting attacks from ISIS and the Kurds, they remain largely silent regarding Assad, who has made support for Syrian Christian communities a political priority.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4632198c:92233c:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

(Associated Press) PALM BEACH, Fla. — The Trump administration hinted at military action against Syria Thursday as the president and top officials considered how to retaliate against President Bashar Assad for this week’s chemical weapons attack that killed more than 80 people. Military leaders discussed options with the White House, likely including a missile strike.

President Donald Trump suggested that Assad may have to leave power, and his comments were strongly underscored by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who told reporters “there’s no role for him to govern the Syrian people.”

The administration has been put to the test this week amid an international outcry over the newly horrifying violence in Syria. Over the past seven years, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the nation’s civil war, triggering the worst refugee crisis since World War II.

Trump’s tone has grown more grave with the passing days. On Wednesday, he said this week’s attack crossed “a lot of lines” — not just the “red line” of chemical weapons use that President Barack Obama once set as an ultimatum for the Assad government.

Trump has shown a particularly emotional response to photos and video of dead children, and he said Thursday, “I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity.” Asked if Assad should remain in power, he said that “he’s there and I guess he’s running things so something should happen.”

Trump commented aboard Air Force One en route to meet China’s President Xi Jinping at a Florida summit.

Top defense leaders were discussing military options developed by the Pentagon with the president, U.S. officials said. They commented only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to address the sensitive information publicly by name.

The range of options would be likely to mirror those shelved at the last minute by the Obama administration in 2013. Then, the U.S. was poised to launch missiles from ships in the Mediterranean, targeting military air fields, command and control facilities and other key locations.

A precise missile strike, potentially against targets associated with the chemical weapons attack, could be considered an appropriate and measured response, especially in an area where there would be little possibility Russian troops would be present.

The U.S. doesn’t want to start a war with Moscow, and there are Russian troops, aircraft and other equipment on most of the Syrian bases.

Tillerson, who spoke almost simultaneously after greeting Xi in Florida, said there was “no doubt in our minds” that Assad’s government was behind the attacks and the U.S. was evaluating an appropriate response.

“The process by which Assad would leave is something that will require an international community effort,” Tillerson said, adding that there needs to be a balance between defeating the Islamic State group and stabilizing Syria to prevent the civil war from escalating further.

Tillerson also issued a warning to Russia that its support of the Assad government is something that it should “consider carefully.”

Late Wednesday, Trump advisers had huddled at the White House to discuss options for responding to the chemical attack, including both military action and economic sanctions, according to a senior administration official. It was unclear how fast the president planned to decide and implement a response, according to the official, who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the sensitive planning.

Tillerson has been in contact with his Russian counterparts, the official said, but Trump has not spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump told reporters traveling with him to Florida Thursday that he may speak with Putin.

In Moscow, Putin’s spokesman said Russia’s support for Assad has limits but there must be a full investigation of the attack before the United Nations takes any action.

As for Russia’s influence, Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with The Associated Press that “it is not correct to say that Moscow can convince Mr. Assad to do whatever is wanted in Moscow. This is totally wrong.”

In Washington, two senior Republican senators called for Trump to strike at Syria’s air force as part of a swift and forceful response to the attack, which killed more than two-dozen children.

Sens. John McCain of Arizona, who spoke to Trump on Wednesday, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement that Assad “must pay a punitive cost for this horrific attack.”

“This is a test of the new administration, but also for our entire country,” said Graham and McCain, who have been among Trump’s harshest congressional critics. “Assad is trying to see what he can get away with.”

Graham later told reporters he doesn’t believe Trump needs Congress to authorize the use of military force in Syria. He added that the Senate has become so dysfunctional it may be difficult to get Republicans and Democrats to agree on a resolution approving the use of force.

“Hit this guy,” Graham said of Assad. “You’ve got my full permission.” He said he has not talked to Trump about military options.

But Sen. Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, took a more measured approach, saying he first wanted to hear from the White House what military options it may be considering.

Asked if he supported grounding Syria’s air force, Corker told reporters he’d “like to see what the administration proposes.”

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., said he was glad that Trump was meeting with national security advisers to consider options to hold Assad accountable. He encouraged Trump to consult with Congress, too.

“The use of chemical weapons is abhorrent, and Assad’s brazen gassing of men, women and children cannot be tolerated,” Royce said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b462b89d0:917dbd:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON – President Trump ordered a cruise missile strike against a Syrian regime military airbase, in response to a chemical weapons attack carried out by the regime earlier this week.

At 8:40 p.m. EDT, the U.S. launched 59 Tomahawk land attack missiles at the Shayrat Airfield located in the Homs Governorate in Western Syria, according to Pentagon officials. The strike lasted minutes.

“This was in response to the Syrian chemical weapons attack April 4th in Khan Sheikhoun… That attack killed and injured hundreds of innocent Syrian people, including women and children,” said Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis.

“The strikes were intended to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again,” he said.

The missiles were launched from U.S. destroyers USS Porter and Ross, which were in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea at the time, he said.

The missiles hit aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers, air defense systems and radars, he said.

Davis said the U.S. military took care to avoid any human casualties. It notified Russia – and “many countries” – of the planned strikes ahead of time. There were Russian troops at the airbase, although it’ is not clear if they were still there during the strikes.

Davis said the U.S. struck an area where Russian and Syrian troops were not located.

“In this case in particular, every precaution was taken to execute these strikes with minimal risk to personnel at the airfield,” Davis said.

The strike was aimed at deterring another chemical weapons attack by the regime.

The airbase was the same one the regime used to carry out the chemical weapons attack, Davis said. The U.S. military said it tracked the two aircraft that the regime used to conduct the attacks.

The airbase also housed one of Syria’s main chemical weapons storage facility prior to 2013, he said.

Trump had hinted on Wednesday during a Rose Garden briefing with the King of Jordan that he would take action against the regime.

He said the attack had crossed “many, many lines, beyond a red line — many, many lines.”

“That attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me. Big impact,” Trump had said. “That was a horrible, horrible thing, and I’ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn’t get any worse than that.”

Trump reportedly spoke with lawmakers before the strike.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) called on the president to come to Congress to seek congressional authorization for military action in Syria.

“While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the US was not attacked,” he said in a statement. “The President needs congressional authorization for military action and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate on our role. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different.”

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) called Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a “monster” and a “puppet of Russia and Iran” but said he looked forward to the president “making the case to Congress and the American people” in the days ahead.

Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic defense hawks praised the airstrikes.

“Unlike the previous administration, President Trump confronted a pivotal moment in Syria and took action,” said Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC).

“I think it was an important step,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said on CNN. “This was not some symbolic measure.”

“I support the admin’s strike on the air base that launched the chemical attack. I hope this teaches Assad not to use chemical weapons again,” said Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL).

In a statement, President Trump explained the urgency behind the strikes:</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4610d4a4:8e5060:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Director Joss Whedon took to Twitter Thursday to express his fear that President Donald Trump’s administration may mimic the Chechnyan government and begin arresting and killing gay people.

The Avengers director was reacting to a Twitter user who had posted a New York Times article titled “Chechen Authorities Arresting and Killing Gay Men, Russian Paper Says.”

Chechnya has begun a massacre of its gay male population. https://t.co/BrAPyfiq6o — ANTHONY OLIVEIRA (@meakoopa) April 2, 2017

In response to the NYT article, the director wrote, “This is harrowing, and it’s where we’re headed if we don’t unite and act. Please use your #resistance skills to address this atrocity.”

Whedon actively worked against Trump during the election and has spent months hurling personal attacks against the president and his family.

In September, Whedon assembled the cast of his Marvel comics movie and other Hollywoods stars to produce an anti-Donald Trump campaign ad.

Shortly after Trump’s historic victory, Whedon said Trump cannot “cannot be allowed a term in office.”

“It’s not about 2018. It’s about RIGHT NOW,” he wrote.

In January, the Buffy the Vampire Slayer scribe attacked President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and compared his wife, Ivanka Trump, to a dog.

“Hey, keep your eyes on this fu*king prize too. He’s a Voldemort in training,” he wrote on Twitter, sharing a photo of Jared Kushner standing next to Trump in the Oval Office.

“Unlike the Pekingese he married under, can play the long game,” he added, comparing Ivanka to the dog breed.

In January, Whedon used his Twitter account to wish for a painful and humiliating end to House Speaker Paul Ryan.

“Violence solves nothing. I want a rhino to f*ck @SpeakerRyan to death with its horn because it’s FUNNY, not because he’s a #GOPmurderbro,” he wrote.

Rapper T.I. unloaded on black celebrities who met with Donald Trump after the election, saying they failed to challenge the president for disrespecting and degrading black voters during the campaign.

The Atlanta–based artist told the co-hosts of The View Thursday that he took issue with talk show host Steve Harvey, rapper-producer Kanye West, and football Hall of Famer and civil rights champion Jim Brown meeting with Trump.

“Before you stand and smile and say this is a good man and take pictures, what about addressing the disrespect and disregard for our community that was done?” T.I. said, adding “And what about him being the poster child for white supremacy and standing for the people who look to devalue our lives?”

The Grammy-winning star of the VH1 reality show T.I. &amp; Tiny: The Family Hustle also defended fellow rapper Snoop Dogg, who recently starred in a politically-charged music video that sees the “Doggystyle” rapper pull a gun on and “shoot” a parody clown version of President Donald Trump.

“Whatever Snoop said, he had the right to say. He’s protected by the Constitution in saying it,” T.I. said. “We have to protect our legends. We have to protect our heroes and the people who mean something to us and our community and our culture.”

The View co-host Sunny Hostin suggested that Trump advisor Omarosa Manigault has stated the administration’s intention to “bridge the gap” between the White House and the black community, to which T.I. responded with a personal insult.

“She can’t even bridge the gap in her teeth,” the rapper said.

T.I. had originally defended Snoop Dogg and his controversial video in an Instagram message, calling Trump a “f*cking tangerine tanned muskrat scrotum skin, lacefront possum fur wig wearing, alternative fact, atomic dog diarrhea face ass man [sic].”

A reporter from online campus watchdog site Campus Reform asked Harvard students to decide what they find more dangerous: President Trump or ISIS.

Watch the video here:

Several Harvard University students argued that President Trump poses a greater threat to the United States than ISIS, the radical and violent terrorist organization.

One student argued that Donald Trump’s policies are a greater threat because “terrorism is not really that big of a deal.”

This week, Harvard student organizers put together a four-week online course on how to “resist” the Trump agenda.

The program’s website lists sessions with titles like “How to Communicate Our Values in Political Advocacy” and “How to Structure and Build Capacity for Action.” So far, organizers say they have about 3,000 groups “representing over 10,000 people” registered for their first class.

A plan by President Donald Trump’s administration to “extreme vet’ foreign refugees entering the U.S. in the hundreds every week could include an ideological test.

The Trump Administration is looking at a number of ways to vet foreigners entering the U.S. through a more rigorous, extensive process that would include asking whether or not an individual has the same values as American citizens, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.

Officials working on the vetting process also said foreigners could be asked to disclose their social media passwords, past financial records and cell phone data–coupled with questions on ideology.

Director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) Mark Krikorian told Breitbart Texas that he thinks the ideology-based vetting process being considered is “necessary.”

“The idea is that we shouldn’t just screen people who may commit violence against us, but that we should also be keeping out people who hate our values,” Krikorian said in an interview. “Especially for immigrants, people who are going to be here. It’s less important for foreign tourists. But, we should try to keep people out from our society who hate us.”

Krikorian said that unlike Trump’s twice shot-down executive order which halted travel flow into the U.S. from specific countries, the vetting process would need to apply to all newcomers.

“It can’t be country-specific, because you could have people who hate our values coming from any country,” Krikorian said.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Trump’s promise of extreme vetting remained important, predominantly as a national security issue.

“If there is any doubt about a person’s intentions coming to the United States, they should have to overcome—really and truly prove to our satisfaction—that they are coming for legitimate reasons,” Senior Counselor to Secretary John Kelly, Gene Hamilton told the Wall Street Journal.

Most recently, Breitbart News reported how the State Department is increasing the number of refugees that are admitted into the U.S., pushing that figure to about 900 per week.

Refugee resettlement expert Ann Corcoran told Breitbart Texas that major reforms to the refugee program are imperative under the Trump Administration.

“This is our only opportunity right now to reform the refugee program,” Corcoran said in an interview. “If it doesn’t happen now, it will never be reformed.”

Corcoran says an executive order to slow the flow of refugees being resettled from primarily Islam-majority nations is not necessary, telling Breitbart Texas that Trump “has enormous power over this issue.”

“I am particularly concerned that the Trump Administration doesn’t understand the program,” Corcoran said. “And I’m afraid they’re being rolled by the bureaucrats.”

Partial transcript as follows:

TILLERSON: Well obviously, the events that have occurred in Syria with the chemical weapons attack here in the past day I think have just horrified all of us and brought to the front pages and to our television screens as well the tragedy that is part of the Syrian conflict. There is no doubt in our mind and the information we have supports that Syria, the Syrian regime under the leadership of Bashar al-Assad are responsible for this attack and I think further it’s very important that the Russian government consider carefully their continued support for the Assad regime.

REPORTER: Does Assad have to go?

TILLERSON: Assad’s role in the future is uncertain and with the acts that he has taken, it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people.

REPORTER: And what steps is the United States prepared to take in order to remove him from power?

TILLERSON: The process by which Assad would leave I think requires an international community effort, both to first defeat ISIS within Syria, to stabilize the Syrian country, to avoid further civil war and then to work collectively with our partners around the world through a political process that would lead to Assad leaving.

REPORTER: So will you and President Trump organize an international coalition to remove Assad?

TILLERSON: Those steps are under way.

REPORTER: Has President Trump been talking about that with other leaders.

TILLERSON: We are considering an appropriate response which violates all previous U.N. resolutions, violates international norms and long-held agreements between parties including the Syrian regime, the Russian government and all other members of the U.N. Security Council. It’s a serious matter. It requires a serious response.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Former U.S. Army Ranger and Benghazi survivor Kris “Tanto” Paronto told Breitbart News that he believes former President Barack Obama National Security adviser Susan Rice “needs to be in jail” for her decision to willfully unmask the identities of United States citizens connected to President Donald Trump’s transition team.

Paronto added, “The Trump administration has been given the perfect opportunity to set an example, or make an example, out of the type of politician that she is and show these other politicians that they are no longer untouchable.”

“I thought Hillary Clinton was bad,” Paronto said. “This woman [Susan Rice] surpasses her as far as her evilness and willingness to subvert America with this administration and to continually lie.” He added, “This woman broke the law. She put lives in danger. She put officers in danger. She put American citizens in danger by doing that. She has no value for human life unless it benefits her politics or benefits her friendship with the crooked administration that was in power for the previous eight years. That woman, at the very least, needs to be in jail. She has no value of human life.”

Instead, Paronto suggested Rice lied to protect Obama and questioned her allegiance to the United States. “There is no gray area; she lied. And she’s still protecting her mentor, Obama, from that administration. Her allegiance lies, for some reason misguidedly with them, not with the United States of America.” Paronto also criticized Rice for saying that Bowe Bergdahl served with honor and distinction. “I didn’t know a traitor could serve with honorable distinction and then get six of his fellow soldiers killed trying to find him. The woman has no integrity. She should have no credibility. And honestly, in my opinion, she should be in prison for unmasking and putting American citizens in danger.”

While Trump critics and former officials on Obama’s National Security Council did not dispute the report, they argued that Rice did nothing “illegal” in unmasking the identities of those Americans. Conversely, Trump administration officials have not stated that the unmasking was “illegal” but that leaking the identities of the individuals unmasked was.

He said he hopes President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions will go after Rice but said, “I don’t think justice will take place because I haven’t seen it yet. “Justice could have taken place with Hillary Clinton because she did violate national security; she did lie. Justice could have taken place” when it was discovered that interim DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile gave Clinton’s camp questions before a town hall debate while she was a contributor to CNN. He added, “Justice could happen with Susan Rice and her lying on national TV continually about a video causing Benghazi when it didn’t.”

Rice said it was a YouTube video, not then-President Barack Obama’s foreign policy, that prompted the Benghazi attack that left Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others dead. It was not.

Paronto was among four surviving warriors who defended more than 30 American personnel in two American facilities in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The attacks were carried out by the Islamic militant group Ansar al-Sharia. In addition to Ambassador Stevens, former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty and State Department IT specialist Sean Smith were also killed.

“The Trump administration has been given the perfect opportunity to set an example, or make an example, out of the type of politician that she [Susan Rice] is and show these other politicians that they are no longer untouchable.” He said Rice’s decision to unlawfully unmask the identities of American citizens for “political gain” was a “gift” to President Trump “to set an example. This will influence future politicians from not telling the truth.”

Paronto said that when news first broke of the unmasking, he thought, “She’s going to be hailed a hero by CNN, by MSNBC, by the Washington Post because of what she did.” He added, “But what she did is not heroic: it’s criminal and unpatriotic. It completely lacks any integrity.” Paronto said, “I guarantee you, in the next week as things start to fall on Susan Rice, they’re going to come to her rescue and label her a hero because they have such a left-wing bias that they cannot see the truth, even if it smacks them across the face.”

Asked where he was on the Sunday that Rice suggested it was the YouTube video “Innocence of Muslims” that prompted the deadly Benghazi attack, Paronto said he was in Germany. “I had just woken up and I turned the TV on. I was tired. When I saw the news, I just kind of went, ‘What the hell?’ I called Jack Silva and I said, ‘Hey, turn the TV on. Did you guys talk to anybody? Has anybody said anything to anybody?&apos;”

Paronto said the next thought he had was of how corrupt the Obama administration was and said, “Well, that’s par for the course. And then I went back to bed. They could have thought of a better excuse than that. They could have thought of a better lie.”

He said while he was angry, he did not dwell on it because he was “expecting it” from the Obama administration. “They don’t want people to know the truth. They just want to continue to lie to maintain power. Something needs to happen, publicly, to an elected official. Leading a public official out in handcuffs would shake things up.”

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) had also suggested there were inconsistencies in what Paronto said regarding a “stand down” order from a CIA officer. Schiff suggested Paronto was dishonest. Asked to react, Paronto said, “He says he didn’t call me a liar. We talked, and he said we were just getting conflicting information.” Paronto then noted, “Susan Rice was telling half-truths. Well, half-truths to me are lies. And Rep. Adam Schiff from Washington went on Hannity to debate us.”

Schiff was was invited but he did not come on to the show.

However, Paronto said his issue with Schiff, whose father was also a veteran, is something else. “I have problems with Adam Schiff because when I look in his eyes, I really think he is a good man. But politics has corrupted him so much that I don’t think he knows the truth anymore.”

“He’s letting politics dictate his ideology, and he’s wrong,” Paronto said. “He can’t challenge his paradigm. He can’t challenge that his Democratic beliefs are so wrong. He just can’t accept it.”

Kris Paronto currently serves as the Chairman of Leading from the Front, which is part of a non-profit organization, the American Legacy Center.

One day after what was demonstrably one of the most-covered stories by the media focused on the “removal” of Steve Bannon, President Trump’s top adviser, from the National Security Council (NSC), he attended a council meeting, the Washington Examiner reported on Thursday.

“White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has attended the first meeting of the National Security Council after he was removed from the principals committee Wednesday,” the Examiner story said.

Despite the headlines about Bannon’s removal, most media outlets included the fact that the change on the council only meant Bannon was no longer a permanent member on the council but that he retained top security clearance and could attend council meetings.

“Bannon is still permitted to go to NSC meetings,” Fox News reported on Wednesday.

CNBC reported that Bannon can attend council meetings by invitation of the president or H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser.

“He is one of the president’s closest and most trusted advisers,” a White House source told CNBC when asked why Bannon attended.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b44e50265:717282:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Tuesday at her weekly briefing, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said President Donald Trump’s proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border was “an insult to our hemisphere.”

Pelosi said, “I think the wall is ineffective. It’s an immorality really, an insult to our hemisphere. And I hope that we don’t have that. Do we have the responsibility to protect our border? Yes, every country does. Can we do that using technology and our customs authorities and the rest of that? Sure. A wall? No. So I would hope they wouldn’t try that.”

Analysis by the BBC’s State Department correspondent Barbara Plett Usher places responsibility for Tuesday’s reported chemical attack in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun, north-west Syria, on President Donald Trump for not having engaged in a campaign of regime change in the country.

The piece for Britain’s state-owned, tax funded broadcaster briefly acknowledges that the culprit for the use of chemical weapons has not yet been determined, reporting merely that Syrian President Dr. Bashar al-Assad had been “blamed”. Rather than placing blame on any of President Trump’s actions while in office, the BBC report instead finds fault with the President for not having taken the U.S. to war with the Syrian government in the first months of his presidency — and presumably Syria’s Russian allies with it.

Noting, “There is an argument that the Trump administration’s ‘hands-off’ approach to Bashar al-Assad emboldened the Syrian President to carry out atrocities”, the article cites perennial Trump critic Senator John McCain who, amongst his other frequent attacks on President Trump, called his Syria policy “disgraceful”.

The BBC notes, in particular, McCain’s criticism of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said the future of Syria’s governance was a matter for the Syrian people.

Usher’s piece reports President Trump’s policy towards Syria has sat on the “back burner” while the new White House has dealt with other more pressing issues at home. The position appears to be broadly in keeping with previous public comments by President Trump on the country including a 2013 Tweet where he called on then President Barack Obama to not attack Syria and to deal with domestic issues instead.

Indeed, the report notes Trump’s present arms-length policy isn’t much of a development from the ultimate position of the Obama years, which was initially enthusiastic to enact regime change in Syria but backed off when it became apparent that this would entail conflict with Russia.

Despite the bold claims in the headline and opening paragraphs the piece later concedes: “To what degree, if any, Trump has contributed to Assad’s sense of impunity will remain a matter of debate.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4434233f:599e72:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Fox Sports 1 “Undisputed” co-host Shannon Sharpe compared the “different standard” for New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski seen by some NFL players to that of former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump.

Gronkowski only played eight games in 2016 before he had to have season-ending back surgery. The criticism on the tight end comes after he participated in WrestleMania 33 and stole quarterback Tom Brady’s jersey before a Red Sox game this week while recovering from the surgery.

According to Sharpe, Gronkowski gets away with more off the field than black stars like New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant, much like Trump has gotten away with more than Obama, although he did not offer up any examples.

“Think about what was expected of President Obama and then look what is tolerated with President Trump,” Sharpe said.

“Listen, when a white guy does that, that’s just him, that’s Gronk being Gronk,” Sharpe added later. “Let Odell Beckham do that. Let Cam Newton and Dez Bryant do that. Let’s take Cam because quarterbacks are judged t0 — let’s just take one of these guys. Dez Bryant, Odell, Antonio Brown, let them walk around chugging beers … the team wouldn’t go for it.”

President Donald Trump’s campaign promises already have convinced drug companies to lower prices and increase transparency.

In January, Trump put the pharmaceutical industry on notice that drug prices were too high. President Trump explained that drug companies were “getting away with murder.” Trump added, “PhRMA has a lot of lobbies, a lot of lobbyists, a lot of power. And there’s very little bidding on drugs. We’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world, and yet we don’t bid properly. We’re going to start bidding. We’re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.”

Later that month, the president argued that the federal government could save $300 billion if it could negotiate drug prices.

President Trump explained in an interview with Time magazine, which named him “Person of the Year,” that he intended to lower drug prices. Trump said, “Well actually the drug companies haven’t done well. I saw the other day the drug companies have not gone up very much. Because I’m going to bring down drug prices. I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices.”

Trump lamented that the pharmaceutical lobby impeded the ability for the government to negotiate drug prices. “We don’t do it,” he said. “Why? Because of the drug companies.”

In the past, Congress has failed to enact sufficient reforms to lower drug prices. When Congress was drafting the Medicare Part D prescription-drug benefit, big pharma added a provision which banned the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from negotiating with drug companies to set prices.

Last December, the Senate blocked a measure from Senator Bernie Sanders to amend the 21st Century Cures Act, allowing the importation of prescription drugs from other countries and for Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Sanders said on the Senate floor, “I am quite confident that all of my Republican colleagues will support an amendment in my hands that will do exactly what Trump said he would accomplish as president.”

Now, pharmaceuticals cost America over $350 billion a year, which is roughly two percent of gross domestic product. Ravo Mehrotra, of MTS Health Partners, estimated that the government could save $16 billion if the government negotiated drug prices.

In March, President Trump tweeted that he is working on a new system to bring down drug prices.

I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017

Later that month, two of the biggest pharmaceutical firms announced that they will lower the cost of their pharmaceuticals.

Sanofi and Regneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said that its new treatment for atopic dermatitis, a painful skin condition, will cost $37,000. This is a substantial decrease from the $50,000 price tag for similar treatments.

Roche Holdings AG, lowered its price for a multiple sclerosis drug to $65,000, 25 percent cheaper compared to a 15 year-old competitor, Rebif.

Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer told investors, “We believe that Sanofi and Regeneron and the payers are heading perhaps towards setting a new paradigm.” Schleifer added, “But it ain’t over yet.”

Roger Longman, CEO of data analytics company Real Endpoints, said that pharma companies will have to lower drug prices under President Trump. Longman said, “In the old days, if you could convince the physician that one drug was slightly better than another, then he or she would prescribe it, it didn’t matter what the cost was.” Longman added, “Now, the decision makers are the payers: the insurance companies, the employers.”

Marathon Pharmaceuticals paused the launch of its new drug, Emflaza, facing intense public scrutiny regarding the drug’s astronomical $89,000 price tag. Martin Shkreli, famous for raising the price of the drug Daraprim, said that, “These guys invented price increases. I literally learned it from them.”

Since the election of Donald Trump, several large drug companies offered to lower the annual increase of drug prices. Novo Nordisk President Jakob Riis promised to limit the annual increase in drug prices. Riis explained, “We hear from more and more people living with diabetes about the challenges they face affording healthcare, including the medicines we make. We take this issue seriously and have been thinking about what we can do to better support patients,” Riis said. “This has become a responsibility that needs to be shared among all those involved in healthcare and we’re going to do our part.”

Novo Nordisk followed the leadership of Brent Saunders, chief executive of Allergan, who issued a “social contract,” promising to limit the annual increase of the price of pharmaceuticals.

Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Lilly unveiled plans to increase their transparency regarding their drug pricing.

President Trump pledged to lower the price of drugs by easing regulations from the Food and Drug Administration, which would make it easier to get drugs approved. Trump stated, “We’re also going to be streamlining the process, so that, from your standpoint, when you have a drug, you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years.”

Robert Hugin of Celgene argued that the changes encouraged by President Trump stand to benefit every American. Hugin said, “The changes he is proposing are ones that I think are going to be great for the country and consumers.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4419cdf6:5e0969:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) announced Thursday morning that he is temporarily stepping aside from leading a committee probe into Russia’s influence on the 2016 presidential elections.

He said he was doing so after several “leftwing activist groups” filed false accusations against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics, but that he would stand aside from the Russia investigation until it is resolved.

He said in a statement he was temporarily handing over the investigation to committee members Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and Tom Rooney (R-FL). Gowdy led a congressional investigation into the September 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said he continued to have trust in Nunes.

“Devin Nunes has earned my trust over many years for his integrity and dedication to the critical work that the intelligence community does to keep America safe. He continues to have that trust, and I know he is eager to demonstrate to the Ethics Committee that he has followed all proper guidelines and laws,” he said.

“In the meantime, it is clear that this process would be a distraction for the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in our election. Chairman Nunes has offered to step aside as the lead Republican on this probe, and I fully support this decision,” he said. “Chairman Mike Conaway, a senior member of the Committee, will now lead this investigation in the House. I am confident that he will oversee a professional investigation into Russia’s actions and follow the facts wherever they lead.”

The accusations come after Nunes last month announced he saw evidence that members of President Trump’s transition team had their names “unmasked” — or revealed — during the course of U.S. intelligence surveillance on foreign targets.

Unmasking refers to revealing the identities of Americans who are otherwise protected from having their identities known when they are incidentally caught up in surveillance.

A private conversation held between Trump’s then-incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was illegally leaked to the Washington Post in February.

Earlier this week, blogger Mike Cernovich, Bloomberg View, and Fox News revealed it was former Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice who had requested the unmasking.

Rice did not deny doing so, but said it was not politically motivated and denied leaking anything.

“I leaked nothing to nobody,” she said Tuesday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.”

“The allegation is that somehow Obama Administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes. That is absolutely false. I was the national security advisor. My job is to protect the American people and the security of our country,” she said.

North Korea launched another ballistic missile on Wednesday morning – or at least they tried to, since the Pentagon is now judging the test a failure, because the missile did not reach Japanese waters. Fox News quotes a U.S. official saying the missile might have “pinwheeled in flight.”

Furthermore, it doesn’t even look like much of a “test,” because a defense official told Fox it was an older SCUD missile, not one of the new weapons North Korea has been working on.

Secretary of State Tillerson’s official response to the North Korean provocation suggested he was not provoked. His statement was exactly 23 words long: “North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.”

This unprovoked response to North Korea’s flaccid provocation was, in turn, highly provocative to Chris Cillizza of CNN, who suffered a complete meltdown on Wednesday morning:

That’s a total of 23 words, if you’re counting. Twenty-three words that leave you more confused when you get to the end of them than when you started. Is Tillerson trying to talk tough? Or is he refusing to give North Korea the attention he thinks they’re trying to grab in advance of the US-China meeting? Somewhere in between? Neither? Both? The statement reads, to channel Winston Churchill, like a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. It’s Ernest Hemingway but for complicated and delicate matters of foreign policy. It’s, in a (hyphenated) word, a head-scratcher.

The rest of Cillizza’s column collapsed into a long argument with himself about whether diplomatic ambiguity is “dangerous” because “misunderstandings can cause international incidents,” or if Tillerson’s brevity was an appropriate expression of the Trump administration’s tough new “time for talking is over” stance toward Pyongyang.

At roughly the same time, CNN was running another article from James Griffiths which noted Tillerson might have been doing the right thing by ignoring the “airborne middle finger” from Pyongyang ahead of the summit between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, and it doesn’t much matter what Western powers say about North Korea’s behavior anyway:

The test, which sent a missile into the sea off North Korea’s east coast Wednesday, occurred ahead of a hugely important meeting between the leaders of the US and China this week and has been described by one analyst as an insult from Pyongyang to US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. “It was an airborne middle finger to Trump and Xi before they sit down for their summit,” said Euan Graham, director of the international security program at Australia’s Lowy Institute. The US response, delivered via Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was short and sharp — “The United States has spoken enough about North Korea”. It was very different from previous lengthy, threat-laden responses. And while Tillerson’s taciturn comments were instantly criticized online, analysts said it was difficult to gauge if his approach would make much of a difference compared to his predecessors’.

Is the contrary argument that Trump would be somehow giving Kim Jong-un the green light to nuke half of Asia by refusing to respond at length to every missile launch, no matter how half-hearted the provocation? As the Fox News report points out, many analysts believe North Korea is preparing for another nuclear weapons test, possibly during Xi’s visit to Washington. Perhaps saving the strong words for that will better convey the seriousness of the new administration’s approach.

Coincidentally, former CIA director Michael Hayden gave a speech at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies on Tuesday in which he warned North Korea could become capable of hitting Seattle with “an indigenously produced nuclear weapon aboard an indigenously produced intercontinental ballistic missile” before President Trump leaves office.

Hayden said it would be “probably a low-probability shot” if North Korea actually launched a nuclear missile at Seattle, but stressed there was an “inexorability” about their developing the capability.

Yonhap News reports that Hayden also quoted former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper’s assessment that Pyongyang would be “crazy” to halt its nuclear program after the effort already devoted to it, and China regards North Korea as a “bad toothache” it can generally ignore. He suggested China’s attitude could be changed by making “the toothache hurt more,” with measures such as deploying the THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, and perhaps Japan.

U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has explicitly described the Trump administration’s approach to China and North Korea in these terms: “I think the United States has seen China, for 25-plus years, say that they’re concerned about North Korea, but we haven’t seen them act like they’re concerned about North Korea. I think this administration wants to see them act, and they’re going to pressure them to do that. Hopefully China will respond favorably, because we know at the end of the day, the only one that North Korea’s really going to respond to is China.”

Fox News quotes Ralph Cossa of the Pacific Forum CSIS joking that North Korea “doesn’t mind being hated, but they definitely hate to be ignored.” Tillerson’s supporters applaud him for giving Pyongyang what it hates. It will be up to President Trump to work on Beijing’s toothache while President Xi is in Washington.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b43974780:4ee97d:28ce9b86</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Trump plans military action on Syria after horrific nerve gas attack on civilians



In a very dramatic gesture, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley at the Security Council stands and displays picture of baby killed by nerve gas and excoriates Russia’s ambassador for supporting al-Assad, saying, ‘How many more children have to die before Russia cares?’

President Donald Trump on Wednesday made it clear that he is planning some sort of action against Syria. Although he did not specify what kind of action, saying that he did not want to telegraph his plans, he did imply that military action is planned.

The change of mind was triggered by a horrific chemical nerve gas attack on Syrian civilians on Monday, indiscriminately killing dozens of people. The pictures of children being killed apparently particularly affected Trump. The nerve gas was delivered in bombs on warplanes, which could only have been warplanes from the regime of Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad. After the nerve gas attack, another missile attack struck the hospital where nerve gas attacks had been taken, effectively putting the hospital out of service. There was clearly an intent to kill as many people as possible, including women and children.

Syrian state media denied that that Syria was responsible:

The government of the Syrian Arab republic categorically denies the allegations and false accusations about the use of poisonous, chemical weapons by the Syrian Arab army in Khan Sheikhoun region against Syrian civilians who are besieged by the armed terrorist groups as human shields there, Syria also affirms that the Syrian army doesn’t possess any kind of chemical weapons and it has not used them and it won’t use them in the future.

The above statement contains known lies. Syria has provably used Sarin gas and chlorine gas in bombs in the past. No part of the above statement is credible, in view of the evidence. ARA News (Syria) and SANA (Damascus)

President Trump declares that he’s changed his mind about military action

At a news conference on Tuesday, Trump commented on Monday’s nerve gas attack in Syria, explaining why he changed his mind:

Yesterday, a chemical attack – a chemical attack that was so horrific, in Syria, against innocent people, including women, small children, and even beautiful little babies. Their deaths was an affront to humanity. These heinous actions by the Assad regime cannot be tolerate… Well, I think the Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand. And when he didn’t cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world, because it was a blank threat. I think it was something that was not one of our better days as a country. … I now have responsibility, and I will have that responsibility and carry it very proudly, I will tell you that. It is now my responsibility. It was a great opportunity missed… It crossed a lot of lines for me. When you kill innocent children, innocent babies — babies, little babies — with a chemical gas that is so lethal — people were shocked to hear what gas it was — that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line. Many, many lines.

In 2013, Bashar al-Assad launched a Sarin gas attack against civilians, after President Barack Obama has said that doing so would “cross a red line.” At that time, Trump tweeted the following:

AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA – IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN &amp; FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!

However, Trump has now reversed those sentiments, and is blaming Obama for not intervening in 2013. However, he’s not calling it “a flip-flop,” instead ascribing it to flexibility:

I like to think of myself as a very flexible person. I don’t have to have one specific way, and if the world changes, I go the same way, I don’t change. Well, I do change and I am flexible, and I’m proud of that flexibility. And I will tell you, that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me — big impact. That was a horrible, horrible thing. And I’ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn’t get any worse than that. And I have that flexibility, and it’s very, very possible — and I will tell you, it’s already happened that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much. And if you look back over the last few weeks, there were other attacks using gas. You’re now talking about a whole different level.

He says that he will not reveal his plans, but implies that the plans are military (as opposed to, say, sanctions):

Well, one of the things I think you’ve noticed about me is, militarily, I don’t like to say where I’m going and what I doing. And I watched past administrations say, we will attack at such and such a day at such and such an hour… I watched Mosul, where the past administration was saying, we will be attacking in four months. And I said, why are they doing that? Then a month goes by, and they say, we will be attacking in three months, and then two months, and then we will be attacking next week. And I’m saying, why are they doing that? And as you know, Mosul turned out to be a much harder fight than anyone thought, and a lot of people have been lost in that fight. I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other, but I’m certainly not going to be telling you, as much as I respect you, John.

Marco Rubio says Trump’s policy emboldened Bashar al-Assad

In the past, I’ve criticized President Obama for flip-flopping on his “red line” statement. My point was not that military action should have been pursued. My point was that Obama should never have made a threat that he wasn’t going to act upon, since flip-flopping only emboldened Bashar al-Assad to commit worse atrocities.

Now Senator Marco Rubio is making a similar criticism of President Trump. He’s referring to recent statements by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that the Trump administration no longer plans to demand that Bashar al-Assad step down.

According to Rubio:

In this case now, we have very limited options and look, it’s concerning that the Secretary of State, 72 hours ago or a week ago, last Friday, said that the future’s up to the people in Syria on what happens with Assad. In essence almost nodding to the idea that Assad was gonna get to stay in some capacity. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that a few days later we see this.

Rubio’s claim is quite plausible.

One might ask what al-Assad’s motivation was for ordering Monday’s horrific nerve gas attack. It was so outrageous, and so likely to backfire politically, that it really makes no sense.

Every time I write that Bashar al-Assad is psychopathic monster and war criminal committing genocide against Sunni Muslims in Syria, I get criticized by al-Assad acolytes and paid Russian trolls. But I don’t think that there is any doubt about this. Bashar al-Assad is the worst war criminal so far this century, with a psychopathic desire to exterminate all Sunni civilians. Nothing else can explain this insane action.

Al-Assad has never agreed to the peace that was agreed a few months ago in Astana, Kazakhstan, between Iran, Russia and Turkey. In fact, he has never shown any interest in participating in any peace process. I’ve pointed out many times, that al-Assad clearly has no intention of doing anything but torturing, slaughtering, and exterminating as many Sunni civilians as possible.

Al-Assad has apparently been controlling his urges for political reasons for the last few months. Trump’s previous reluctance for military action in Syria, reaffirmed by Tillerson’s claims that the US would no longer demand that al-Assad step down have given a free ticket to al-Assad to do anything he wanted, and like an alcoholic who suddenly is told he can start drinking again, al-Assad suddenly felt freed to do whatever he wanted. I believe that that’s what Rubio meant, and I agree with it. International Business Times

John McCain and Lindsey Graham advocate cruise missiles and safe areas

Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham were interviewed on Fox News on Wednesday evening. Although they were interviewed separately, they made exactly the same points:

Military action is required.

Barack Obama is at fault for not solving this problem earlier.

Cruise missiles should be used to disable al-Assad’s air force.

Safe zones should be set up so that Syrian refugees in Europe and America could return to Syria.

Here are the remarks of John McCain (my transcription):

Those are horrible, and I spoke to the president this morning. He’s angry as he well should be , and he’s consulting with his military leadership, as well as his Secretary of State, and I have some optimism that he will take some concrete action here. He is obviously, as we all are, appalled. Could I make two points. One, this is a legacy of Barack Obama. The last time this happened, Barack Obama said they crossed a red line, called me and Lindsey Graham down to the White House, and did NOTHING. You know, one thing worse than doing nothing is saying you’re going to do something as the most powerful leader on earth, and doing nothing. So this is a legacy of Barack Obama, and it’s been going on for the intervening four years. So what we need to do, we need to stop Bashar Assad’s planes from flying. And we can do that easily. Just say don’t fly, or you’re gonna get shot down, and if you start operating out of the six bases that they have, we’re going to crater your runways with cruise missiles and other weapons. 41:54 But you can’t fly because we’re not gonna let you drop nerve gas. We’re not gonna let you drop chlorine. We’re not gonna let you drop barrel bombs. You know what barrel bombs are? They’re large cylindical things filled with shrapnel. And they explode about 20 feet above the ground, and they indiscriminately kill people. He’s got to be stopped from flying, and we can stop him easily, using our cruise missiles and other capabilities. and we’ll tell the Russians, it’s your guy, you can join us in stopping him from flying and committing these war crimes. Then I would have safe zones, and there’s a lot of other things, but the first thing we gotta do is stop his ability to slaughter people.

Here are the remarks of Lindsey Graham (my transcription):

QUESTION: “What should President Trump do to Syria?” GRAHAM: Destroy his air power and create a safe zone in Syria where this never happens again.” QUESTION: “We’d have to bomb their airfields, right? There are Russian planes there.” GRAHAM: “They should move them. Then I would make sure that the people in Idlib would never be bombed again by Assad. There would be safe havens where people could go back to Syria from Europe and the United States. Talk won’t do it. This is a time for Pres Trump to show the world he’s not President Obama. This is a horrible event out of which could come an opportunity to reset the Mideast, to establish his presidency as something different than Obama, to send a dictator to everyone in the world there’s a new sheriff in town. And if he would actually hold Assad accountable and protect the innocent people of Syria, it would help us in Iran and North Korea and everywhere else.

As I’ve been writing for years, Generational Dynamics predicts that Iran and the West will be allies in the approaching Clash of Civilizations world war, and that China, Pakistan and the Sunni Muslim countries will be pitted against the US, India, Russia and Iran. In the Mideast, Generational Dynamics predicts a full-scale Mideast war, pitting Jews against Arabs, Sunnis against Shias, and various ethnic groups against each other.

These predictions will come true with absolute certainty, and it would have made no difference whether Trump or Hillary Clinton had been elected president. The events of the last two days are a major step forward along that trend line.

President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner has reportedly hired top Hollywood public relations executive Josh Raffel to take a key role at the White House.

Raffel — the 32-year-old communications chief for horror production company Blumhouse Productions (The Purge, Insidious) and a veteran of New York City-based PR firm Hiltzik Strategies — will reportedly join the White House Office of American Innovation, according to Variety.

The outlet notes that Raffel is well-respected among entertainment industry journalists for his “sane, sensible style, and his wit.”

The Washington Post reported in March that Kushner had been tasked with overseeing the Office of American Innovation, a new White House office that will reportedly be focused on overhauling the federal bureaucracy by taking ideas from the business world and applying them to government. The office will reportedly be staffed by former business leaders and will report directly to President Trump. Among the notable names in the business world who have already participated in meetings are Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

“We should have excellence in government,” Kushner told the Post last month. “The government should be run like a great American company. Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens.”

Raffel will reportedly move to Washington, D.C. to begin his new job in the coming weeks. He will be replaced at Blumhouse by former Universal Filmed Entertainment Group spokeswoman Teri Everett.

Kushner has quietly become a major force in the Trump administration, as the president has entrusted the young advisor with duties ranging from negotiating a potential Israel-Palestinian peace deal to maintaining a healthy diplomatic relationship with Mexico.

Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said Wednesday that Ohio Gov. John Kasich should run for President again in 2020, challenging incumbent President Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary.

Schwarzenegger made the endorsement in an interview with the Los Angeles Times:

“He should run in 2020, yes,” Schwarzenegger said in an interview with The Times when asked whether Kasich, whom he supported over Trump in the 2016 presidential race, should launch another presidential campaign. “Kasich is an extraordinary guy. He’s a man of substance. He’s worked in Washington, he’s worked in local government, he’s worked in statewide government. He has the experience. He can see things. He has vision,” Schwarzenegger enthused. “He’s also a moderate. He’s a tough Republican and very fiscally conservative, but he also at the same time loves helping people.”

Schwarzenegger backed Kasich in 2016, to little effect. In the Republican primary, the Ohio governor only carried his home state.

Arguably, Kasich made Trump’s primary win easier by staying in the race so long that it became impossible for any Trump challenger — specifically, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) — to round up the necessary delegates and campaign cash.

During the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Kasich refused to show up, angering his own state’s delegation. Despite Kasich’s opposition, Trump carried the crucial Buckeye State by nearly 9 percentage points, taking all 18 Electoral College votes en route to victory.

Trump and Schwarzenegger have carried on a war in social media, trading barbs over political issues and particularly over the ratings of The Apprentice, where Schwarzenegger filled in for Trump but later withdrew from the show.

The Times of Israel reports: WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump said Wednesday he believes his efforts to forge a lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will triumph.

“I think we’ll be successful,” he said during a joint press conference with King Abdullah II of Jordan. “I hope to be successful — I can tell you that.”

Standing alongside the Jordanian leader in the White House Rose Garden, Trump vowed to work with him to attain the elusive peace deal and said he would confer with Abdullah over the best ways to strike a comprehensive accord. “To advance the cause of peace in the Middle East, including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians,” Trump said, “I’m working very, very hard on trying to finally create peace between the Palestinians and Israel.

Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” deputy assistant to President Donald Trump weighed in on the report that former National Security Adviser Susan Rice was behind the “unmasking” of Trump transitional officials in raw intelligence after the 2016 presidential election.

Gorka explained how some Trump officials could be targeted for political means under the current requirements for surveillance.

“Look, the president has been explicit here, Sean,” Gorka said. “We’re going to allow the mandated authorities — the congressional committees to do their work. We’re not going to do witch hunts. That’s what the left radical, progressive political elite does with their enemies. So, we’re going to let the system deal with this as it should.”

“But again, your guests, I listen to your radio show as I was coming into the show today,” he continued. “You had a former operative talk about how it’s not rocket science to engineer a network analysis of telephone calls, who is calling who. If you want to attack me or Steve Bannon or Steve Miller or Kellyanne Conway, you say, ‘Oh, they regularly call their nephew in Canada. Well, that’s a foreigner. I don’t need the same kind of intelligence authorities to intercept a foreign call. Then you start to find a way to unmask all of these conversations so that you can make political profit. That’s a very, very tenable theory. And that’s the kind of thing we have to find out if it was really happening. Because if that’s the case, that is weaponizing intelligence for political purposes against your other party.”

When asked by Hannity how this compared to Watergate, Gorka suggested it paled in comparison.

“Losing 14 minutes of audiotape in comparison to this is a little spat in the sandbox in the kindergarten,” Gorka replied.

Washington (AFP) – Illegal immigration across the US-Mexico border has plunged in the past two months as President Donald Trump’s crackdown takes hold, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Wednesday.

Apprehensions of people trying to sneak into the United States, seen as an indicator of the total flow of undocumented immigrants, dropped to 16,600 in March, down 30 percent from February and 64 percent from a year ago.

Kelly told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security that there was even a sharper fall in the number of families and unaccompanied children crossing the border.

“We’ve seen an absolutely amazing drop in the number of migrants coming out of Central America,” he said.

“In particular we have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of families, the number of children.”

The decline comes after a surge in the last three months of 2016 that appeared to be a reaction to the looming crackdown Trump promised in his presidential campaign.

Trump has pledged to expel the estimated 11-12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, the largest portion of them from Mexico.

Many have been in the country for decades, raising families, building businesses and buying homes.

The White House said the fall in the number of people sneaking into the country was the result of Trump’s policies.

“By achieving real results on illegal immigration, once again, President Trump is keeping his promises to the American people,” press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.

“This decrease in apprehensions is no accident,” Kelly said.

“It won’t last unless we do something to secure the border, a wall or physical barrier.”

The Department’s US Customs and Border Protection unit has added personnel and money to policing the 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border.

But Trump has pledged to build a wall along the entire frontier to halt the flow of people — largely from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and other impoverished Central American countries — into the US.

Plans for the wall are just getting underway, and Kelly acknowledged that a physical barrier along the entire route is not feasible or practical.

Instead, the additions to border control could involve a combination of physical barriers, electronic monitoring and more patrols.

“It is unlikely that we will build a wall, a physical barrier, from sea to shining sea.”

“All we know is that physical barriers do work if they are put in the right places.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b43598498:496352:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump ridiculed former National Security Adviser Susan Rice after a televised interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell.

“Take a look at what’s happening,” Trump told the New York Times. “I mean, first of all her performance was horrible yesterday on television even though she was interviewed by Hillary Clinton’s P.R. person, Andrea Mitchell.”

Trump said he thought that the media was not covering the story enough, pointing to some Democratic friends of his who were disturbed by the civil liberties aspects of Rice’s behavior. The president did not share any new details, but encouraged the press to keep digging.

“I don’t want to comment on anything about — other than to say I think it’s a — I think it’s truly one of the big stories of our time,” he said.

The president also dismissed the media’s obsession with the Russia story.

“The Russia story is a total hoax,” he said. “There has been absolutely nothing coming out of that. But what, you know, what various things led into it was the story that we’re talking about, the Susan Rice. What’s happened is terrible.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b43598498:496350:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Many Fed watchers believe that the central bank could undercut efforts by President Donald Trump to spur faster economic growth by raising interest rates to offset fiscal stimulus. The minutes released Wednesday of the Fed’s policy committee’s March meeting, however, indicate that the Fed isn’t in a rush to raise rates.

Fed officials now believe that Trump’s fiscal, regulatory, and infrastructure policy changes will not have a significant effect on the economy until sometime in 2018. Fed officials “pushed back the timing of when those policy were anticipated to take effect,” the minutes said.

They now think that “meaningful fiscal stimulus would likely not begin until 2018. In view of the substantial uncertainty, about half of the participants did not incorporate explicit assumptions about fiscal policy in their projections.”

Far from worrying that the economy is in danger of overheating, the minutes make it clear that Fed officials see the risks to economic growth as “tilted to the downside.” That’s Fed-speak for the notion that the economy is more likely to grow more slowly than expected than it is to grow at a faster clip.

Overall, however, the Fed’s economic projections were mostly unchanged since the December meeting, when officials boosted their growth expectations based on the belief that the government would adopt more pro-growth policies.

Fed officials also noted “considerable uncertainty about the timing and nature of potential changes to fiscal policies as well as the size of the effects of such changes on economic activity.”

Taken together, these comments indicate that the Fed is taking a wait and see attitude toward Trump’s policies. That means that he likely has more room to adopt economically stimulative policies before he runs into opposition from central bankers.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b41f29479:1fcedd:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The IRS should revoke the Southern Poverty Law Center’s non-profit status for campaigning against President Donald Trump during the 2016 election, says a legal request from a pro-American immigration reform group.

The SPLC’s election-season anti-Trump headlines, contributors’ statements and “educational” initiatives collectively violated tax laws governing non-profits, says the Immigration Law Reform Institute, which is the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.

“To vindicate itself as a fair and balanced agency, the IRS must strip the SPLC of its privileged tax-exempt status,” Dale Wilcox, the IRLI’s general counsel, told Breitbart News. “Their attacks on the President during his campaign were some of the most egregious I’ve ever seen,” he said, adding that “hoarding over $300 million in donor contributions, the group can afford to pay taxes anyway.”

According to tax law, donors can get tax breaks when they contribute to groups that register as 501(c)(3) non-profits. But the law also says that 501(c)(3) must not “participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.”

According to the IRLI complaint, the SPLC posted headlines during the campaign which mentioned the name of Republican candidates, including Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and painted them in an extraordinarily negative light. Examples include “Trump’s Continuing White Nationalist Problem” and “Trump Stump.”

An editorial by SPLC Senior Fellow Mark Potok during the campaign included the following statement about Trump: “the demagogic New York billionaire has poured vitriol on anyone who dared to criticize him, [and] proposed a crude immigration plan that virtually all sensible observers see as brutal and completely unrealistic.”

The SPLC’s “Teaching Tolerance” project is alleged to have distributed a report called “The Trump Effect,” consisting of school teachers’ narrative explanations of the anxiety Trump was causing their students. The SPLC also issued a 13-page report titled “Hate in the Race” focusing extensively on then-candidate Trump and his alleged ties to “hate groups.”

One mission of the progressive SPLC is labeling mainstream conservative groups as “hate groups.” The targeted groups include FAIR and IRLI. The SPLC is “running out of ‘hate groups’ to name and defame [so] they’ve now had to pick up the immigration issue and this is why they’re attacking President Trump and his 63 million voters,” said Wilcox.

The practice has come under increasing criticism in recent years, and even the SPLC admitted it went too far in placing Dr. Ben Carson in its hate lists.

In 2014, the FBI stopped using and re-posting SPLC sources in its website on combating hate crimes. A recent article by conservative charity watchdog Philanthropy Roundtable called the SPLC’s lists “arbitrary” and a “political tool,” citing the listing of social scientist Charles Murray as a “white nationalist” and ex-Muslim activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali as an “extremist.”

Establishment media, however, continue to cite the SPLC’s “hate” designations.

Despite its focus on identifying “hate groups,” the SPLC is entangled with extremism. In 2012, domestic terrorist Floyd Lee Corkins used the SPLC’s supposed “Hate Map” to find the offices of the Family Research Council, which is a Christian non-profit labeled a “hate group” by the SPLC because it opposed the legalization of homosexual marriage. The man walked into the FRC’s offices with over 100 rounds of ammunition and opened fire. Miraculously, only one man, building manager Leo Johnson, was shot before Johnson personally subdued and disarmed Corkins.

Corkins later confessed to prosecutors that he had intended to smear Chic-Fil-A sandwiches on his victims’ corpses in a show of solidarity with pro-gay activists.

The Corkins saga unfolded as the SPLC increasingly filled the rolls of its list with Christian groups whose traditional beliefs the SPLC finds “hateful.”

During the Obama Administration, these classifications by the SPLC were cited by the Department of Defense to monitor servicemen and women who were on these organizations’ mailing lists for links to “domestic hate groups.” The SPLC’s say-so was also used to train soldiers to use ties to evangelical Christianity and support for the Tea Party as criteria in identifying domestic terrorists.

The SPLC did not respond to Breitbart News’s requests for comment.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b41d6f924:1d60e0:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Wednesday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Rep. Maxine Waters (R-CA) was asked by show host Chris Hayes to react to President Donald Trump’s response to a question about sexual harassment charges aimed at Fox News Channel host Bill O’Reilly in an interview earlier in the day.

Trump called O’Reilly “a good person” and argued O’Reilly should fight those charges.

Waters, however, took aim at both O’Reilly and Trump and went as far as to say O’Reilly needed to “go to jail.”

“It is coming out of the mouth of a man who has said some horrible things about women,” Waters replied. “Don’t forget, he talked about grabbing women by their private parts and because he was important he could get away with it and so they are two of a kind. And so I am not surprised he stood up and tried to defend Bill O’Reilly. But, it’s all catching up with Bill O’Reilly and that sexual harassment enterprise that they created over there at Fox. And it’s catching up with them and you have over 30 advertisers who have taken away their advertising.”

“They are not wanting to do business with them anymore because of the way they have created this record of sexual harassment,” she continued. “They have treated women very badly. And so I understand the Justice Department has opened a case. They’re taking a look at them because this really is a sexual harassment enterprise. It shouldn’t be in America that you can sexually harass women and then buy your way out of it because you’re rich.”

“If they continue to do this in the way that they’ve done it, they need to go to jail,” Waters added. “You know the president’s over there talking about Susan Rice going to jail. They need to go to jail. Bill O’Reilly needs to go to jail. And so, I just want you to know that the president didn’t do himself any good standing up for O’Reilly. And where was Ivanka? She’s supposed to be his adviser. She’s supposed to be the one that is standing up for women. I think she either advised him wrong or she is absent. She’s not in it.”

winning its historic women’s basketball national championship, the University of South Carolina Gamecocks face the same decision as many other national champions, namely whether or not they will accept an invitation to visit Donald Trump’s White House.

But, as far as Gamecocks head coach Dawn Staley is concerned, her team will accept that invitation because “it’s what national champions do.”

Staley, an American basketball Hall of Famer and three-time Olympian, made it clear that if her team is invited to the White House she intends to accept the offer.

“I’ve got options now. Yeah, I’m going to the White House,” she told the Associated Press. “It’s what it stands for. It’s what national champions do. We’ll go to the White House.”

Staley’s last visit to the White House was during George W. Bush’s first term in 2004, when she was a member of the U.S. Olympic team.

One of Staley’s players also expressed an interest in going to the White House.

“I’ve never really been to the White House. It should be exciting to go with this group of girls,” South Carolina’s star player A’ja Wilson said. “We’re going to have fun, so I’m excited. Honestly, I’m just going to go and enjoy the moment, just take it all in. This is probably a once-in-a-lifetime thing, so why not enjoy it?”

The decision of whether to accept an invitation to the White House has been a hot topic among sports leagues, many of which have been radicalized by black lives matter-styled politics. Last December, for instance, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made to politicize such visits, saying that teams “miss an opportunity” not to politicize their invitation.

Silver is not alone. With the New England Patriots Super Bowl win, several team members decided to skip their team’s visit to the White House, some citing their dislike of President Trump.

Other college teams have spoken on the topic as well. North Carolina Tar Heels Basketball Coach Roy Williams, for one, said he’d have to carefully consider any visits to the Trump White House.

Many in sports media have also discussed White House visits in the era of Trump. Just last year, ESPN’s Jalen Rose said it was obvious that many players would decide to skip visits to the White House occupied by the “really divisive” President Trump.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are still waiting to see text of a proposal from the Trump Administration that would allow states to obtain waivers for Obamacare’s guaranteed issue, community rating, and essential health benefits mandates.

Vice President Mike Pence has been making trips to Capitol Hill this week for discussions on healthcare and the repeal of Obamacare with members of Congress, including the Freedom Caucus. In a Monday evening meeting the Vice President presented a plan that would allow states to opt out of Obamacare mandated provisions including “essential” health benefits, community rating, and guaranteed issue.

Shortly after the Monday meeting, Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows spoke positively of the discussion with hopes to see text of the agreement within 24 hours. A source close to the talks indicated that as of Wednesday morning the Freedom Caucus was still waiting for that text.

Another meeting that continued late into Tuesday evening involved moderate Republicans, Republican Study Committee, Freedom Caucus, and members of the Trump Administration including Vice President Pence. The meeting has been described as a discussion out of which no decision was reached.

A Freedom Caucus representative told Breitbart News:

The Freedom Caucus remains wholeheartedly committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare with a market-driven approach that brings down costs for consumers. The AHCA in its current form doesn’t bring down premiums, but we are optimistic the proposal from Vice President Pence could accomplish that goal and keep our promise to the American people. We look forward to reviewing text.

Members of the moderate Tuesday Group, who also pose a threat to passage of Obamacare repeal and replace, met with members of the Administration on Monday at the White House.

On Monday evening, Meadows told reporters that no Freedom Caucus members had changed their positions on the Republican House Leadership’s Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA).

Sen. Rand Paul and President Donald Trump met and golfed together in Virginia last weekend. Paul told reporters that he was “very optimistic” about progress towards repealing Obamacare.

This week in an interview on New York City’s Fox 5’s “Good Day New York,” actor Robert De Niro said President Donald Trump was a “mutt” who has “debased the presidency.”

De Niro said, “This is guy has sullied the presidency, he’s debased the presidency. It’s just beyond surreal what this guy has done.”

He added, “He’s a mutt.”

As soon as the media learned Steve Bannon, one of President Donald Trump’s senior advisers, would no longer have a “permanent seat” on the National Security Council, the headlines shouted he’d been “removed,” “booted,” and “demoted.”

In fact, Bannon remains a close adviser to Trump, with top security clearance and an open invitation to attend NSC meetings.

Bannon also has said in a statement that his work on the council was complete.

“Susan Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration,” Bannon said in a statement. “I was put on to ensure that it was de-operationalized.”

“General [H.R.] McMaster has returned the NSC to its proper function,” Bannon said, referring to Trump’s National Security Adviser.

But the headlines were greeted by the left as a success in their efforts to undermine the Trump administration.

“A huge victory for the resistance: Bannon’s sick ideology will no longer infect the National Security Council,” Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) tweeted on Wednesday.

“The removal of white supremacist and conspiracy theorist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council will make America safer,” a statement from MoveOn.org said.

“MoveOn members and other Americans taking action via allied organizations generated 1.1 million signatures calling for Bannon’s removal from the NSC, and our voices were heard. Now it is time to fully remove him from his role in the White House,” the moveon.org statement said.

“We hope that Stephen Bannon’s removal from the National Security Council will soon be followed by his ouster from the White House entirely,” a statement from the Southern Poverty Law Center said. “By his own admission, Bannon provided a platform, through Breitbart News, for a new breed of white supremacists.

“He’s also been responsible for the bizarre appointment of former Breitbart writer Sebastian Gorka, someone with ties to anti-Semitic, far-right groups in Hungary, to a position in the White House,” the statement said. “The sooner that Bannon and people like Gorka leave Washington, the better.”

Rep. Robin Kelly (D-IL) tweeted she was happy she joined Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) in promoting legislation that would have forced Bannon to leave the NSC.

“#SteveBannon removed from NSC! Proud to have joined @RepStephMurphy‘s effort to kick him off,” Kelly tweeted.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-FL) said Bannon wants to overthrow the U.S. government.

“#SteveBannon has made numerous inflammatory statements in support of overthrowing the United States Government,” Espaillat tweeted.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b40deff9c:8887a:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

One has to read beyond the headlines about Steve Bannon and his role in the President Donald Trump administration to understand that he remains a senior adviser to the president with top security clearance and is welcome to attend any National Security Council meeting.

In fact, his changing role in the Trump administration was planned, according to Bannon.

“Susan Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration,” Bannon said in a statement. “I was put on to ensure that it was de-operationalized.”

“General [H.R.] McMaster has returned the NSC to its proper function,” Bannon said, referring to Trump’s National Security Adviser.

Although the headlines about Bannon used terms like “removed” and “booted” in stories about the new structure of the NSC, the facts are buried in most of the news coverage.

Bloomberg, which was the first to report on the development, equated not having a “permanent seat” on the NSC as being removed, but later in its coverage explained Bannon’s changing role in the White House:

A White House official portrayed the change as a natural progression rather than a demotion for Bannon. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, contended that Bannon was placed on the committee in part to monitor Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and never attended a meeting. He’s no longer needed with McMaster in charge of the council, the official said.

The New York Times used the headline “Trump Removes Stephen Bannon From National Security Council Post, “but did report halfway through the story that this development was “a logical evolution”:

A senior White House official presented the move as a logical evolution, not a setback for Mr. Bannon. He had originally been put on the principals committee to keep an eye on Mr. Flynn and to ‘de-operationalize’ the National Security Council after the Obama administration, this official said on condition of anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. This official said that process had been completed. Another official close to Mr. Bannon insisted the move was not in any way a sign that the president had lost confidence in him or wanted to reduce his portfolio. And as evidence he will still play a role in national security decisions, the aide said that Mr. Bannon still maintains the highest level of security clearance in the West Wing.

The Washington Post used “removed” in its Bannon story headline, but explained early on that not having a “permanent seat” on the council in no way diminishes Bannon’s role in the Trump White House — after reporting that critics have long said Bannon has no national security experience and that some high-ranking national security personnel were left out of the NSC. According to the Post:

The White House strongly disputed that characterization, saying that Trump chose to change the structure of the committee from the one in place during the Obama administration to reduce the number of meetings in which senior intelligence officials were required to participate if they did not pertain to their areas of expertise. Instead, one of the officials said, Bannon was put on the council early in the administration to guide and keep watch over then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was tasked with reshaping the operation. That official and a second official said Bannon did this from afar, attending one or two meetings of the group. “Bannon was there to “de-operationalize” the NSC from its Obama-era setup, the official added, and he feels that has been accomplished with Flynn and his successor H.R. McMaster and no longer feels the need to be part of the NSC. Bannon retains his title and position and remains a confidant of the president who is working closely with other advisers on domestic and foreign policy.

Fox News followed the media’s lead but did add this fact to its reporting:

“Bannon is still permitted to go to NSC meetings,” Fox reported.

Online talk radio host Bill Mitchell joined the social media rant on the Bannon story and tweeted this:

“My take on Bannon leaving the NSC. Rice weaponized the NSC. Trump put Bannon in to fix that. He did. Now, other fish to fry.”

The memorandum that is posted in the Federal Register explains that “senior officials” can participate in NSC meetings. It says, “The security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries. Accordingly, the United States Government’s decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative. Both Councils are statutory bodies that the President will continue to chair. Invitations to participate in specific Council meetings shall be extended to those heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue or issues under consideration. When the President is absent from a meeting of either Council, the Vice President may preside at the President’s direction.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b40deff9c:88879:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee told Breitbart News that he is very concerned about allegations that Susan Rice, President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, abused her access to intelligence reports that included incidental collection of information about associates of President Donald Trump.

“First of all, I don’t know all there is to know about what Susan Rice was doing,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).

Rice is accused of “unmasking” the names of American citizens associated with Trump in intelligence reports. Those names are deliberately cloaked to preserve the constitutional protections against warrantless monitoring enshrined in the 4th Amendment.

“What we do know about Susan Rice is you can’t believe what she says, and that is pretty obvious, so we need to get her under oath,” he said.

“It doesn’t surprise me in the slightest that the former administration would utilize the awesome power of the government–they did it with Lois Lerner and the IRS, using the IRS as a political weapon against their political opponents,” he said.

If the Obama administration was willing to use the IRS for political advantage, it is natural for them to use the federal surveillance programs, as well, he said.

“We need to get her under oath in front of the Intelligence Committee and let’s see exactly what we do find out about her,” he said.

Johnson said he is not worried that political abuse of surveillance and intelligence gathering programs would jeopardize the actual programs themselves. “In a responsible person’s hand, it should not be a problem. We do need the ability to gather intelligence. We need the ability to do these things.”

The senator said another problem is how intelligence related to Trump made its way into the press.

“We need to keep these pieces of information classified, as well,” he said. “There’s a reason you have classified information and national security interests–it is how you keep the nation safe.”

The senator said there is a difference between national security career professionals and the political appointees, such as Rice.

“The vast majority of people, career folks in the NSA or the FISA courts, these are patriots trying to keep the nation safe,” he said.

“When you have political hacks that potentially use these agencies improperly? That’s the problem. You have to get the political hacks out of the process.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b40deff9c:88878:1980c846</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Wednesday at a press conference Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said President Donald Trump needs to get tough on China because he has been “a 98-pound weakling.”

Schumer said, “One of the few hopes we had with President Trump is that he’d finally stand up to China. But up to now, when it comes to China, he looks like a 98-pound weakling.”

During a segment on InfoWars today, Roger Stone, who was previously an adviser during the early months of President Trump’s campaign, claimed to host Alex Jones that Trump’s own son-in-law Jared Kushner was leaking information to MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough.

“Jared Kushner, perhaps the one presidential aide who cannot be fired, is now in regular text message communications with Joe Scarborough,” Stone claimed. “Many of the anti-Steve Bannon stories that you see, the themes that you see on Morning Joe, are being dictated by Kushner. And while Mr. Kushner’s plate is very full with Middle Eastern peace and the China visit, and so on, in this case I think he is disserving the president.”

…

“There is no question now that sources tell me that the president’s son-in-law enjoys a very lively text exchange with Joe Scarborough,” Stone continued. “Joe Scarborough is no friend of the president, he revels in passing fake news.

White House estimates show that the slashing of regulations that has already taken place under President Donald Trump will save approximately $10 billion over the next 20 years, nearly $1 billion per regulation.

Since taking office, Trump has repealed 11 regulations implemented under Barack Obama, aided by a 1996 law which allows Congress to repeal legislation with a simple majority.

Some of the regulations that have been repealed include rules on coal mining and EPA related regulations, women’s healthcare protections, as well as gun limits for the severely mentally ill.

With the deadline for Congress invoking the Congressional Review Act on April 28th, Republicans remain hopeful that further regulations can be repealed and signed off before that date, Marc Short, White House director of legislative affairs, confirmed on Wednesday.

In January, Trump signed an executive order proposing that for every new regulation introduced, two separate regulations must be cut. He then signed another order in February creating “regulation watchdogs,” designed to dissolve the rulemaking power of federal agencies.

As part of his plan to reinvigorate small business and stagnant economic growth, Trump has pledged to cut taxes and regulation “massively,” although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned that tax reform is unlikely to be completed before August.

During his final year in office, former President Barack Obama oversaw record levels of regulation, with an average of 18 pieces of regulation applied to every new law, as well as record levels of red tape, with 97,110 pages printed in the 2016 Federal Register.

Trump’s overreliance on Kushner illustrates the extraordinary premium he places on loyalty. Kushner’s status as a visionary is entirely disputable: His real-estate company was a birthright, not a start-up, and as an article by Charles Bagli in The Times this week demonstrated, one of Kushner’s key acquisitions, the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue, turned into an albatross. But he married Ivanka. He’s family. And he chose the political ambitions of his father-in-law over his own previous reputation as a reasonably enlightened man.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b4035e1e8:3315738:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Wednesday’s broadcast of “MSNBC Live,” host Katy Tur argued that President Trump is continuing a rhetorical tactic from the campaign where “anybody who watched him could take whatever they wanted to” from Trump’s statements, including, “If you were a Donald Trump supporter because you liked the offensive things he said, you were a white nationalist, maybe, you took his subtle queues and his lack of severe condemnations as a cue that, you know, he is accepting of my point of view, and he’s going to champion what I want. And you’re seeing that with foreign policy.”

Tur said Trump’s “sentences are stronger than they are. … And this is exactly the way he operated in the campaign, and what was so — brilliant is the wrong word, but what was so brilliant about it was that anybody who watched him could take whatever they wanted to take from that. So, if you were a Donald Trump supporter because you believed he’s going to bring back jobs, the offensive things he said, you put to the side, you didn’t worry about.

WASHINGTON,D.C.—Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) announced on the Senate floor Wednesday that they will not allow a filibuster of Neil Gorsuch, and will instead vote for the constitutional option to restore a simple-majority vote to confirm Supreme Court nominations, making that outcome now almost certain.

Earlier during the day Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) claimed that he had the 50 votes he needs—plus Vice President Mike Pence as a tie-breaker, if needed—to invoke the constitutional option and confirm President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee.

With his towering stature in the party, both in seniority and later as the 2008 presidential nominee, McCain was seen by some as the de facto chairman of the Gang of 14 effort in 2005 to save the option of filibustering judicial nominees in the future — but allowing through many of President George W. Bush’s nominees that were then being blocked by a Democratic filibuster. Ironically, that strategy’s architect was none other than Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who implemented it in 2003.

“The unprecedented nature of the Democrats’ filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee has left me in a difficult position,” the Arizona senator lamented on the state of affairs in 2017, and after surveying years of past practice in Senate confirmations.

“I’m left with no choice,” McCain declared. “I will vote to change the rules to allow Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed by a simple majority.”

“Elections have consequences,” McCain affirmed. In this case, that means electing a Republican president and a Republican majority in the Senate.

For her part, Murkowski has long supported the Gang of 14, even though she had not been part of it in 2005, so she was another senator to watch in this unfolding historic drama.

Speaking shortly before McCain, Murkowski made comments, then announced, “I will not acquiesce to an effort to deny Judge Gorsuch a seat on the Supreme Court.”

“I am left with the undeniable impression that Neil Gorsuch has been nominated to a position that he prepared his whole life to assume,” Murkowski continued. “He is not merely a good choice in my book, he’s the best choice… perhaps a justice of historic proportions.”

President Donald Trump said he was disturbed by reports of chemical weapons used in Syria but told reporters that he would not signal any plans for action in the war-torn country.

“That attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me. Big impact,” Trump said. “That was a horrible, horrible thing, and I’ve been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn’t get any worse than that.”

The president made his remarks during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday with King Abdullah II of Jordan.

“I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other, but I’m certainly not going to be telling you,” Trump said.

Trump said he was flexible in reaction to foreign policy around the world, but criticized the Obama administration for declaring the use of chemical weapons as a red line in Syria and then backing down.

He said that after the attacks his attitude toward Syria and President Bashar al-Assad “has changed,” despite past statements urging the United States to stay out of Syria.

“That crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line — many, many lines,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3fac2f13:324e4e3:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Proposed drawings of the border wall promised by President Donald Trump include plans for bombproof concrete, solar panels, and a fiber optic tunnel detection system. Contractors expressed concern about attacks during the construction process and received numerous death threats for bidding on the project.

Officials are expected to choose 4-10 companies to build a prototype section of wall to demonstrate their bid’s viability and effectiveness. Officials with knowledge of the plan spoke to the Daily Mail on condition of anonymity and said the prototypes would be built on a quarter-mile strip of federally owned land near San Diego.

The Trump Administration began seeking bids to build prototypes of the wall in February, Breitbart Texas reported. More than 300 companies quickly signed up to present proposals on how to take the President’s vision and promise to reality.

Expressing concern over security during the construction process, bidders asked how the government would respond to help their crews if they came under “hostile attack,” the Daily Mail reported. Another company expressed the desire to allow their workers to carry a sidearm for self-defense. They want the government to protect them and their workers from lawsuits if the use of deadly force became necessary.

The government plans to use Border Patrol agents and local police to establish “buffer zones” around the construction projects to ensure the safety of workers. However, the San Diego police and sheriff’s office said their protection would extend to peaceful, law-abiding protesters, and made no mention of protecting construction workers.

‘There will be a lot of different activity – protests, prayer vigils – on both sides of the wall,’ Enrique Morones, executive director of Border Angels, an open border advocacy group, told the Daily Mail. ‘We pray and hope that they’re peaceful.’

Breitbart Texas reported in March, that efforts to obtain private land along the Texas/Mexico border have already begun. Nearly 600 miles of the border is owned by private individuals, tribal nations, and various other governmental entities, according to the General Accounting Office.

Comedian Louis C.K. says he regrets comparing President Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler, although he now believes the commander-in-chief is a “lying sack of sh*t.”

Last March, C.K. wrote a lengthy email to his fans and urged conservative voters to not mimic “Germany in the ’30s” and vote for the “insane bigot” Donald Trump.

“Please stop it with voting for Trump,” C.K. wrote. “It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the ’30s. Do you think they saw the sh*t coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.”

The Hitler comparison earned C.K. a spot on the cover of the New York Daily News alongside Trump. The comedian now says he regrets “saying it,” but insists that that “doesn’t mean it’s not true.”

“I thought he was some new kind of evil but he’s just a lying sack of sh*t,” C.K. said of Trump Tuesday in an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Explaining his thinking, the Horace and Pete star categorized different kinds of liars.

“Sometimes people lie. ‘That guy lied, they found out he lied.’ And then there’s somebody who lies once in a while, can’t quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right? Somebody who lies sometimes,” C.K. continued. “Then you have a liar, who’s somebody who has a problem, they can’t help it, they lie a lot. And then you have [Trump] a lying sack of sh*t. It’s insane, he’s just a gross crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t.”

When Colbert pointed out that a Trump supporter was in the audience, C.K. said the man is nothing more than a “victim” of Trump’s lying.

“He lied to him. He didn’t lie to me. Everybody else was like, ‘Yeah, no, that’s not true.’ But that guy bought it,” he said.

The former Late Night with Conan O’Brien writer was promoting his new Netflix comedy special, tilted Louis C.K. 2017.

Alec Baldwin has a warning for anyone “on deck” to run against President Donald Trump in 2020: you are not going to win.

In an interview with Extra, the Boss Baby actor said that he would enter politics if only to offer “something different” to the American people.

“I would love to run for office because I think people need something different,” Baldwin said, adding, “I think that all the people that are on deck in 2020, none of them are going to win.”

“None of those people are going to beat [Trump],” the 59-year-old star continued. “You think things are bad now; I tell you when things are going to be worse, if he wins again.”

To be clear, Baldwin, who has spent months playing Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, ruled out adding himself to the ballet: “We’re not going to do that.”

Asked if he is worried that his new memoir, titled Nevertheless, will caused controversy, Baldwin said “I’m married, we have a wonderful family, that’s all I care about.”

Earlier this week, Baldwin appeared on Good Morning America to promote his new book, during which he opened up about a 2007 voicemail to his then-11-year-old daughter Ireland.

“It’s thrown in your face every day,” Baldwin said of the voicemail, which was leaked to the media, and caught the actor calling his daughter a “rude, thoughtless little pig.”

“There are people who admonish me, or attack me, and use that as a constant spearhead to do that,” Baldwin explained. “It’s a scab that never heals because it’s been picked at all the time by so many people. I think my daughter, that’s hurt her in a permanent way.”

On Tuesday, producer Dana Brunetti — who worked with Baldwin on the 2006 independent film Mini’s First Time — slammed the actor’s claim in his biography that he did not know he was filming sex scenes with an underage Nikki Reed.

Christian and Yazidi Iraqis lament the dire future facing their minority communities in new video footage obtained by Breitbart News. Both groups have nearly been eradicated by the genocidal Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).

“We do not have any future here,” proclaimed Rooney Sakaria, a member of the Baghdad-sanctioned Assyrian Christian fighting group known as the Nineveh Plain Protection Units (NPU).

“Maybe we do not have life here,” he stressed.

Sakaria made his comments during a discussion with a Yazidi translator who asked to use the pseudonym Adam for fear of his safety.

The Yazidi translator agreed with the NPU Fighter that there is no future for their communities in Iraq.

“We [have] the same problems,” declared Adam, adding, “It’s just from genocide to genocide to genocide. We’ve lost a lot Christians. We’ve lost a lot of Yazidis. We have lost even a lot of Sunnis. We’ve lost a lot of Shias, but we’re still the victims as minorities.”

Through the perspective of an Iraqi Catholic priest, a member of a Christian militia, a radio D.J., and a translator, the footage provided a glimpse of the conflicting emotions felt by many members of the war-devastated country’s minority groups.

“We all know that the world is not fair, okay?” said Assyrian-Chaldean Christian Noor Mati, a radio DJ from Detroit currently based in the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan Erbil.

“We don’t ask for too much — just a chance to survive [and] just a chance to be alive, that’s it,” added the DJ and founder of the Shlama Foundation, an organization that helps refugees.

A Breitbart News source, who asked to be identified only as M.P. for fear of retaliation, spoke to the Christians and Yazidi in different parts of Iraq last month as the U.S.-backed local forces fought to push ISIS out of Mosul, the capital of northern Iraq’s Nineveh province.

Retaking Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is expected to break the jihadist organization’s hold over its territory in the country and break its so-called caliphate up. The fight for Mosul, believed to be the ISIS’ last major stronghold, has been raging since mid-October.

Despite the toll the ISIS-perpetrated genocide took on their community, not all Christians expressed reservations about their current predicament and future.

Father Immanuel, a Syriac Catholic priest from the besieged city of Mosul, expressed confidence that President Donald Trump will keep his promise to protect and support the ethnoreligious minority groups victimized by ISIS.

“I prayed for Trump until he became the president because I love him,” the Catholic priest, who also serves as the manager of a refugee camp, said during an interview, later adding, “Trump is the voice of the minority people who live in the Middle East. He is the only one who understands our suffering…”

Father Immanuel’s comments echo other Christians in Iraq who recently expressed hope in President Trump.

Sakaria and Adam also expressed some optimism that President Trump may alleviate their precarious situation.

“I think Mr. Trump can do something for these communities,” said the NPU fighter.

“We hope that,” added Sakaria. “Thank you, Mr. Trump, if you can do something.”

Remember that time an ESPN employee criticized a player for disrespecting the anthem, while bad-mouthing leftist protesters, and got to keep her job without suffering any professional consequences whatsoever?

Yeah, me neither.

Word came down on Tuesday that ESPN removed Sage Steele from the NBA Countdown show, making Michelle Beadle the full-time host. Beadle and Steele had split co-hosting duties until recently.

The move is kind of a shocker, with less than two weeks away from the start of the NBA playoffs, when you would think most networks would be consumed with postseason broadcast preparations, and not making lineup changes to their broadcast teams.

However, the move seems much less of a shocker when you consider who Sage Steele is, and who she works for.

Steele committed the cardinal sin of daring to challenge the liberal orthodoxy that racism can only come from whites. While speaking at a conference on race in February, Steele said, “The worst racism that I have received [as a biracial woman married to white man], and I mean thousands and thousands over the years, is from black people, who in my mind thought would be the most accepting because there has been that experience. But even as recent as the last couple of weeks, the words that I have had thrown at me I can’t repeat here and it’s 99 percent from people with my skin color. But if a white person said those words to me, what would happen?”

And, why had Steele become subject to such insults? Steele spoke out against leftists who delayed flights while protesting President Trump’s executive orders on immigration. She also criticized Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans for kneeling in protest during the national anthem.

For those stances, Steele was excoriated on social media.

Of course, no one at ESPN would actually say that Steele was taken off her show due to her political beliefs, nor could such a thing be definitively proved from the outside looking in.

However, while no one can prove Steele’s political views are the reason for her removal from NBA Countdown, it’s perfectly reasonable to claim that the reaction to her firing has everything to do with her political views.

After all, here we have a black woman replaced by a white woman, on a show that covers a league which is overwhelmingly black. And yet, where has the sports media outrage gone? Who is accusing ESPN of racism, for pulling one of the relatively very few black voices in sports broadcasting in exchange for just another white person? Who’s talking about Steele’s ability to understand the culture of the sport which she covers much better than Beadle, because she’s black and can identify with their story?

If Steele had established herself as a hardcore lefty, like Jemele Hill and others have, would she be getting that kind of outpouring of sympathy? It’s very reasonable to believe she would.

Still, Steele’s time at ESPN isn’t over. She signed a long-term deal with the company and will likely be put on several new assignments, in addition to her on-site SportsCenter duties. Nonetheless, like Curt Schilling and Rush Limbaugh before her, Steele has once again shown that if anyone attacks political correctness, or liberal politics, while at ESPN they will pay a very, very steep price.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday on some ideas the Trump administration is discussing for the “extreme vetting” of foreign visitors, including asking the subjects to reveal their cell phone contacts, hand over the passwords to their social media accounts, supply financial records, and “answer probing questions about their ideology.”

“The administration also wants to subject more visa applicants to intense security reviews and have embassies spend more time interviewing each applicant. The changes could apply to people from all over the world, including allies like France and Germany,” the WSJ reports.

According to The Hill, the ideological probe could include questions such as “whether visitors support honor killings and whether they regard the ‘sanctity of human life.&apos;”

The WSJ reasonably expects civil liberties activists to object to these changes in vetting procedures and also worries that other nations could retaliate with similar requirements on Americans seeking visas.

Although the Wall Street Journal states that the “full scope” of these extreme vetting measures has not been discussed with the American public yet, the article notes that many of the proposed changes were discussed in widely-reported congressional testimony by such high-profile officials as Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.

For instance, the Atlantic tore into Kelly for telling the House Homeland Security Committee in February, “We want to say for instance, ‘What sites do you visit? And give us your passwords,’ so that we can see what they do on the Internet. If they don’t want to give us that information, then they don’t come.”

This comment was described as “horrifying” to privacy advocates and potentially “beyond most interpretations of the law,” even though the Atlantic conceded such questions are already asked “occasionally and informally” by border security agents in the U.S. and elsewhere – including immigration-friendly Canada.

One privacy advocate told the Atlantic that extreme vetting for every traveler might transgress against the low standards for “reasonable suspicion” in quizzing foreign visitors. Of course, if the standards are not applied to every visitor without much regard for country of origin, the Trump administration will likely run afoul of the activist judges who conjured hazy “anti-Muslim bias” arguments to block President Donald Trump’s order to suspend visas from six or seven countries that pose exceptional security risks.

Every step taken to focus vetting on high-risk populations, to employ scarce security resources more wisely and minimize the inconvenience to travelers, increases the chance that the enhanced vetting system will be denounced as unfair and discriminatory.

The U.S. government has taken a great deal of heat for missing social-media indications of radicalism after terrorist attacks. Not only is there bureaucratic apprehension about suffering another “lone wolf” attack from someone who turns out to have a long history of surfing jihadi websites, but no doubt, there are agents throughout the national security apparatus who think it is very reasonable to catch potential terrorists by scouting their online activity.

As the Atlantic piece noted, Israel’s invasive but remarkably effective screening procedures have been influential on American reformers for a long time, but they have also been criticized by privacy advocates within and outside of Israel. Some of those activists worry that American adoption of invasive Israel-style measures will give them more global legitimacy and inspire more countries to employ them.

Conversely, those who desire stronger security against extremists might applaud the proliferation of “extreme vetting” since more countries using the procedures would make it more difficult for threatening individuals to move around the world.

Another concern raised by the Wall Street Journal is that extreme vetting will harm the tourism industry because visitors will be nervous about handing over “cell phones and social-media passwords at the border.”

Bloomberg News relates fears of a “lost decade” for the $250 billion travel industry under President Trump, due to his executive orders, the new restrictions on passenger electronic devices aboard flights from certain airports, and extreme vetting measures.

“Mr. President, please tell the world that while we’re closed to terror, we’re open for business. Imbalanced communication is especially susceptible to being ‘lost in translation’ – so let’s work together to inform our friends and neighbors, who could benefit from reassurance, not just who is no longer welcome here, but who remains invited,” read a letter from U.S. Travel Association to President Trump.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3e98adf6:3488dd1:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Jared Kushner, a senior advisor to President Donald Trump and the President’s son-in-law, boasts a thin resume in diplomacy.

The businessman and former New York Observer publisher has emerged as one of the most quietly recognizable figures in the President’s major foreign policy plays – and as a guiding force behind major domestic initiatives as head of the new Office of American Innovation. The President has made big promises betting on Kushner’s ability to deliver, among them the resolution of these five surprisingly delicate problems for a 36-year-old real estate mogul:

Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Dispute

Shortly before his inauguration, President Trump told The Times of London that he planned to give “good lad” Jared Kushner expansive powers for helping resolve critical international disputes, particularly brokering peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Touting Kushner’s “innate ability to make deals” in a separate interview, Trump guaranteed that Kushner would “secure an Israel deal which no one else has managed to get.”

Trump has assured that Kushner “knows the region, knows the people, knows the players” and will be a critical broker in resolving conflict in the region.

On Inauguration Day, Trump went even further: “If you can’t produce peace in the Middle East,” he told his son-in-law, “nobody can.”

Kushner’s family boasts personal ties to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but Kushner himself has not previously involved himself in Israeli politics. The Israeli government appeared open to relying on Kushner as a chief U.S. envoy. “We would be so happy if someone could bring peace to the Middle East. We welcome him,” Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said at the time.



Eradicating ISIS from Iraq and Syria

Less of a diplomatic mission than a military one, Kushner appears to have assumed the task of helping pave the way for a peaceful, united post-Islamic State Iraq. Kushner traveled to the war-torn country this week, alongside chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford, to meet with Iraqi leaders and visit a key outpost near Mosul, the largest Islamic State stronghold in the country.

Kushner met with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, whose spokesman said Kushner, Dunford, and the Iraqi officials discussed “the continuation of the cooperation to eliminate ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and also the training and arming of the Iraqi Army.”

On Tuesday, Kushner and Dunford visited an Iraqi base near Mosul, the closest Dunford has been to the fighting (this is Kushner’s first visit to Iraq). According to Reuters, Kushner proclaimed the Iraqi-U.S. military efforts against the Islamic State “very impressive.”

Ending the Opioid Addiction Epidemic

Last week, President Trump appointed Kushner to be the head of the White House Office of American Innovation, a new government agency tasked with… innovation. Among the problems Kushner will be responsible for solving innovatively will be the growing rate of addiction to heroin, morphine, and other opioid drugs in the United States.

As part of his work in the office, Kushner had reportedly been working behind the scenes for weeks with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie before the latter was announced as the new frontman of an anti-drug initiative in late March. While Kushner has remained largely silent in public on the topic, Christie has vowed to dedicate effort to the initiative.

Bridging the Divide Between the Trump Administration and the Muslim Community

As with a number of other major international visits, Kushner sat in on an Oval Office meeting earlier this year with Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman. According to a Buzzfeed report citing leaders attending the meeting this week, Kushner also led a conversation with Muslim-American leaders shortly after the election.

The Buzzfeed report claims Kushner met with “a prominent imam, a civil rights attorney, the director of a nonprofit that studies violent extremism, and two venture capitalists,” and the meeting “went smoothly,” in part due to Kushner’s “friendly tone.”

There is little more information on whether the meeting was the first in a series or what the objectives of that meeting were. As Kushner’s star has risen following Trump’s election, however, the President appears to be trusting Kushner more and more in precisely these settings: roundtables with prominent individuals focused on how to solve problems. And in this case – between advocacy by Muslim interest groups against Trump and media disinformation on Trump initiatives to keep the country safe – a gentle hand may be the key to fostering cooperation.

Maintaining Friendly Ties to the Government of Mexico

While Kushner’s foreign policy responsibilities appear largely tethered to the Middle East, he emerged an unlikely diplomatic tool for the President to use in his relationship with Mexico.

In January, the Chicago Tribune cited an administration official as confirming that Kushner had played a pivotal role in resolving a short-lived disagreement between Trump and Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto. By March, when Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray arrived in Washington, Videgaray met with Kushner before visiting the State Department, as is typically done.

The Washington Post reported that Kushner involved Videgaray in the drafting of remarks by President Trump regarding the wall Trump promised to build on the U.S.-Mexico border and that the chief diplomat helped Kushner and Trump edit a speech that was well-received by Mexican authorities and reportedly garnered Kushner praise behind the scenes.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3e7d2247:30623a5:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

As critics cast doubt on whether President Trump’s proposed wall will curtail illegal immigration, the recent success of a barrier built in Arizona suggests otherwise, according to a retired border officer.

A wall built on the southern border near Yuma, Arizona, cut illegal crossings from Mexico into the United States by 94 percent, according to Senate testimony by the former Deputy Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol Ronald Colburn, which was previewed by the Washington Examiner.

In his opening statement during the hearing, committee Chairman Ron Johnson R (WI) outlined the importance of the wall and that it is needed to gain control over the southern border.

“As [Homeland Security] Secretary Kelly testified to the committee in January, ‘the number one threat to the nation is that we do not have control of our borders. Without control, every other kind of threat—drugs, illegal migrants, counterfeit manufactured goods and pharmaceuticals, diseases, terrorists, and the list goes on—can enter at will, and does,” said Johnson.

Colburn proceeded to give an account of the effect that the barrier near Yuma had on illegal crossings.

“Violent bandit activity went from the record 200 attacks and over 1,800 victims the year before, to zero, after fence. The number of violent assaults on Border Patrol Agents also declined drastically,” said Coburn.

The construction of the border barrier brought known drive-throughs, “where smugglers load up vehicles with their contraband of drugs and people and simply drive across the open,” from 2,706 instances down to six. Arrests made by Yuma Sector Border Patrol Agents of went from 138,000 before the wall, to 8,363 after the wall.

The former Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David Aguilar, also prepared testimony for the hearing.

Aguilar outlined several issues that could present problems for the border wall, including: federally endangered species; lands set aside to protect wildlife; privately property where eminent domain may need to be used, and a small Native American nation near the border.

Despite these potential hurdles, Aguilar believes that a barrier on the southern border in essential:

The above noted issues will have to be taken into consideration. But it is important to note that there is nothing more destructive to environmentally sensitive land and quiet communities than the uncontrolled illegal flow of people, vehicles, smugglers, and criminal organizations. The placement of fences and deterrent infrastructure in previously uncontrolled parts of the border have actually allowed for the rejuvenation of areas that had previously been devastated due to heavy illegal pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Fences, barriers, and walls have been instrumental to the Border Patrol’s successes on the border… I believe walls, fences, and border infrastructure will definitely be a part of what the Border Patrol will be identifying as current requirements.”

Bids “on the first design contracts,” were due from companies looking to work on the border wall on April 4, Breitbart News reported.

In the past, North Carolina Tar Heels Basketball Coach Roy Williams has minced no words when it’s come to President Donald Trump, specifically POTUS’s Twitter habits.

Williams once famously said that “our president tweets out more bulls**t than anybody I’ve ever seen.”

However, when asked whether or not his team would visit the White House after winning the NCAA Championship on Monday night, Williams minced away, with a response that left plenty of room for interpretation.

Williams had this discussion with a reporter at the postgame press conference:

Reporter: You said, I guess, on Friday that you’d give an honest answer on Monday about going to the White House and going to see President Trump if you won. Now that you’re here, I’m curious, can’t jinx yourself. So what your thoughts are. Williams: I haven’t had any. I probably screwed it up. I should have told you let me think about it afterwards, because I wasn’t going to jinx myself. We won in ’05; we never got invited. I don’t know if we’re going to get invited this time. That’s a bad way to put it. They invited us in September when they were doing a lot of teams. Well, all my team were already at the NBA training camp and two of them in Europe. So we didn’t go in ’05. And we did go in ’09. But, you know, the office of the presidency of the United States is the most fantastic place you can be. But let me think on it. Again, I don’t know that we’re going to get invited. I really don’t. But I know one thing, we’re putting up a nice banner in the Smith Center that’s hard to get.

That’s hardly the definitive, “honest answer” that Williams had promised if his team won. On the contrary, it sounds like Williams has radically dialed back the rhetoric on Trump since referring to Trump’s Twitter habits as “BS” during the ACC tournament.

In any event, Williams will have some time to think it over. The Patriots will become the first sports team to visit the White House, when they make the trip on April 19th.

A contractor bidding on President Trump’s border wall wants to know if authorities will “rush in” to protect his crew if they come under “hostile fire” during construction, according to an Associated Press story reported by Yahoo News.

Another contractor asked if the federal government could suspend California and other states’ anti-gun laws to allow employees to carry guns, and indemnify them from liability if they are forced to use them.

Since bids were due on Tuesday — and the politics over the construction of the wall are heating up — it should come as no surprise that company owners are concerned for the safety of their employees.

The Chicago Tribune reports that a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that “four to 10 bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes” in San Diego.

The threat of possible violence is very real, as armed Border Patrol Agents are attacked every day — including three times in a single day last month. Past efforts to construct any sort of physical barrier have been met with resistance — mostly from political activists, but also from international drug cartels, border bandits, and the smugglers who profit from trafficking human beings and drugs into the US.

Even though the Border Patrol would have the most immediate jurisdiction in the area, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the agency soliciting the bids, has made it clear that firms must plan on providing their own security.

However, the three main agencies in charge of law enforcement for the region — Border Patrol and the San Diego Police and Sheriff’s Departments — will reportedly enforce a buffer around the construction zone, if deemed necessary, while also respecting the “constitutional rights to free speech and assembly for any peaceful, law-abiding protesters.”

With inflammatory rhetoric coming from every direction — including the Mexican Archdiocese, who declared that any Mexican companies who help build the wall will be considered “traitors” to their country — the company (or companies) who win the right to build it are likely to see more trouble ahead, as some of the contractors have received death threats simply for bidding on the project.

In response to the questions about security, AP reported that CBP said that “the Border Patrol would respond as needed if there is a hostile attack, but companies were responsible for security. The government won’t allow waivers from state gun laws or indemnify companies whose workers use deadly force.”

CBP has indicated that it plans to award the contract by June 1 of this year, and will only announce the winning bidders.

Four Republican representatives announced their plan Tuesday to deny general federal funds from American cities that harbor illegal aliens and frustrate federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.

The move comes after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced his own plans to crack down on these so-called “Sanctuary Cities” by withholding Justice Department grants to which they would otherwise be entitled. Sessions also hinted last week that he would be looking into additional methods of being “detrimental” to these jurisdictions which include some of the nation’s largest communities such as New York City and Cook County, Illinois, home to murder-capital Chicago.

The plan, led by Rep. Steve King (R-IA), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), represents the Congressional answer to the call for wider punishment by Attorney General Sessions, is laid out in a request to be delivered Wednesday morning to both the majority and minority leadership of the House Appropriations Committee.

In addition to these four, the request is signed by 32 other Republican representatives, many of whom have ties to the House Freedom Caucus. The congressmen demand that committee insert language in the bills funding the Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce, Justice, and other agencies that prevents the use of any of those funds in jurisdictions out of compliance with federal immigration laws.

In their request, the representatives cite the tragic 2015 murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco and last month’s gruesome gang rape of a 14-year old girl in a Maryland high school’s bathroom. In both cases, the alleged perpetrators are illegal aliens who escaped deportation, despite having been detained on multiple occasions, due to lax enforcement of federal immigration law.

The congressmen involved have a long history of standing against sanctuary cities and have proposed similar legislation in the past. In light of Sessions’s own pronouncements and a strong focus on the issue from the Administration, however, Tuesday’s proposal holds a new significance.

“The concept of ‘sanctuary city’ policies is in direct opposition to the Rule of Law,” Rep. Goser said in a press release accompanying the request.“I’m pleased to see President Trump and Attorney General Sessions lead on this issue, but the House must also act by using the power of the purse.”

Rep. King pointed directly to the contrast with the past administration. “The lawlessness of the Obama Administration has trickled down to at least 340 local so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions that openly defy federal law and release dangerous criminals,” he said. “It is time Congress acts to protect Americans from 100% preventable crimes, and we can start by enforcing our federal immigration laws.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3e6186f0:302fd83:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie told Breitbart News at a sit-down interview in the congressman’s office he believes the reports of former national security adviser Susan Rice unmasking names of associates of President Donald Trump, collected incidentally and cloaked as a constitutional protection against warrantless surveillance.

“You know? I think there is even more to this story than is being revealed right now,” said Massie, who is the only Republican to have voted against Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) at the beginning of this session of Congress. “For over three years, I have been offering legislation to fix this problem.”

Massie said he agrees with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who told reporters Monday that Rice needs to be brought before Congress and asked questions under oath.

“Oh, I think we should, but if we express all this righteous indignation about these programs? We are obligated to fix these programs,” he said.

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, specifically Section 702, authorizes the federal government to access the communications grids of private Internet and telephone service providers. Instead of an individual warrant for each individual or conversation, the federal government receives annual permission from a FISA judge based on a request signed by both the attorney general and the director of national intelligence.

American citizens cannot be monitored or searched by this process because, unlike foreigners or foreign intelligence agencies, they are protected by the 4th Amendment, Massie said.

When Americans are accidentally caught in the FISA dragnet, their identity is masked as a legal device to protect their 4th Amendment rights, he said.

Massie said he suspects that Rice went into the government database and searched for the names of Americans caught in the drag net, which were accessible through the database.

This is a common practice inside the executive branch and law enforcement agencies with access to the database, he said.

“It is unconstitutional, when they go in and search the database–essentially they are doing a virtual wiretap–as soon as you ID a U.S. citizen,” he said.

Repeatedly, Massie tried to make amendments to funding bills that would have required a warrant for each search for Americans, but those amendments have been ruled out of order, because there is a House GOP rule against attaching policy riders to funding bills, he said.

Now that Rice is the one reported to have abused the surveillance programs, Republican defenders of programs have switched sides, he said.

“I have had Republicans, who are now in the news explaining how this program has been abused, I have had them tell me that there was no way this program could be abused, and it can’t be abused, and I am off my rocker for saying these things,” the congressman said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3e6186f0:302fd82:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Actor John O’Hurley — perhaps best known for his role as Elaine Benes’ boss, J. Peterman, on Seinfeld — has opened up about his storied film career, the election of President Donald Trump, and his new 90-minute song and show business retrospective A Man with Standards.

The former Family Feud host is currently starring in the romantic comedy Swing Away, where he plays an “overzealous American capitalist” inspired by Trump.

“I’ve known Donald for a long time,” O’Hurley told Fox 411 in a recent interview, adding that he’s excited to see someone with business experience become president.

“I’m always a fan of giving a businessman a chance to thin the herd in government because we have this slow growth and our government is just getting too big, to be efficient anymore,” he said. “I want the idea of somebody going in there with a pickax and just chipping it apart.”

“God bless [Trump] for what his challenges are and the resistance that is up against him right now,” O’Hurley added. “I believe in him, I believe in what he’s doing and I wish him the best.”

Echoing comments made previously by actor Mark Wahlberg and Kiss rocker Gene Simmons, O’Hurley said his political views are no more important than those of someone without his celebrity status.

“I always say, whenever I speak politically or speak my political views, I say just because I’m a celebrity, does not mean my opinion deserves to be celebrated. I am just another bozo on the bus,” the 62-year-old star said.

O’Hurley also opened up about his new one-man show, A Man With Standards, which pays tribute to a time in America in which both high musical and moral standards reigned supreme.

“I grew up in the period of the standards and I also was lucky enough to grow up around men, who had standards, manners and back then the manners and the music were really one in the same,” O’Hurley said. “Standards were part of our culture and it’s kind of slipped away as time has gone by.”

Low standards, O’Hurley explained, led to his decision to leave Family Feud in 2010.

“I got tired of people writing to me saying, ‘I can’t watch your show.’ It’s a misnomer calling ‘Family Feud’ because it’s not family,” he said. “It feels like everything became a penis joke and I got a little tired of that. I just felt that there were other ways to be more interesting on television than always trying to push that style of family entertainment.”

At his CEO Business Town Hall Tuesday, President Donald Trump returned to his campaign promise to end the highly unpopular Common Core standards and once again make education policy the domain of local governments.

“Common Core, I mean, we have to bring education more local,” Trump said at the White House. “We can’t be managing education from Washington.”

The president continued:

When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally and they’ll do a much better job… And I like the fact of getting rid of Common Core. You know, Common Core, to me, we have to end it. We have to bring education local, to me. I’ve always said it, I’ve been saying it during the campaign, and we’re doing it.

This month, concerns had arisen about Trump’s commitment to his oft-repeated campaign promise to end Common Core. Toward the tail end of his campaign, Trump’s message shifted from the termination of the controversial standards to school choice.

American Principles Project senior fellow Emmett McGroarty welcomes the return of Trump’s attention to the problematic standards that were quickly adopted by states in exchange for the promise of federal cash and relief from onerous federal regulations.

“More than any other President — or even presidential candidate — ever, Donald Trump has empathized with our citizens, particularly parents, who have seen firsthand the damage done by federal efforts to shape and dictate education policy,” McGroarty said in a statement.

“Today’s comments show that President Trump has not forgotten his promise to end Common Core and return to local control of education,” he added. “He is taking seriously the assurance he made in his Inaugural Address, ‘Today… we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American people.’”

Trump also said his education secretary Betsy DeVos is “doing a terrific job.”

“Highly respected, tremendous track record, but she’s got one of the toughest jobs of any of our secretaries, to me, she’s got one of the toughest jobs,” the president added.

DeVos went to Washington, D.C., to assume her post after working on school choice and school voucher programs in her home state of Michigan. While many in Trump’s base believe school choice is a desirable goal, the view of conservatives and libertarians is that school choice can best be achieved naturally with the elimination of the federal education department.

A recent Heritage Foundation panel of education policy professionals urged the Trump administration and Washington politicians to refrain from making school choice a federal program.

DeVos has drawn concern over some of her decisions and comments since assuming her post. For example, the secretary has surrounded herself with advisers and staff who have ties to Jeb Bush – a vocal proponent of Common Core – as well as to Indiana, where Common Core was repealed but then simply “rebranded.”

DeVos also recently said the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) “essentially does away with the notion of a Common Core,” a statement many grassroots parent activists still battling against the Core in their states have flatly rejected.

Though ESSA still requires the federal education department to approve of state education plans, DeVos, nevertheless, also said in a recent speech, “I share the founders’ belief that those closest to problems usually know best how to solve them.”

Debbie Higginbotham, a spokesperson for Florida Parents RISE, tells Breitbart News DeVos’s comments suggest much ambiguity.

“Secretary Devos’s equating ESSA with ‘federalism’ as it relates to education is the central problem we all face,” she explains. “There is zero provision in the Constitution, deliberately so by the founders, for the federal government to have any purview over education. It was – and is – an issue of local control and sovereignty.”

Higginbotham also argues that DeVos’s claim she is a federalist is in sharp contrast to the ESSA law:

It’s disturbing for the reason that if she holds a true belief in federalism, then she would urge Congress to write a bill that would truly allow the states to: take care of their students with proven, challenging educational standards; eliminate high stakes testing; invite local control of education policy at the school board level; and issue no penalty to the states for replacing the Common Core State Standards with a set of standards of their choice.

McGroarty says Trump’s leadership on the elimination of Common Core in the states is vital from this point forward.

“Every Swamp creature will unite to fight against the president on this, so his leadership will be critical,” he explains. “We look forward to seeing what steps the Trump Administration will take in the coming months to take power away from Washington D.C. and return it to parents.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3ca846c5:2d70656:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The number of migrants illegally coming across the U.S. southern border in March dropped to the lowest level in 17 years, says a leaked agency statement given to the Associated Press.

The statement is included in testimony slated for delivery on Wednesday, April 5, by Gen. John Kelly, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Typically, routine testimony is provided early to the legislators so they can prepare questions for the witness, but it is rarely leaked.

According to the Associated Press:

Secretary John Kelly said the steep decline in arrests is “no accident” and credited President Donald Trump’s approach to illegal immigration… In his testimony for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Kelly said fewer than 12,500 people were caught crossing the border illegally last [in March]. That compares with more than 43,000 in December. Kelly told lawmakers that the number of [Central American] families and children traveling alone — groups that accounted for hundreds of thousands of illegal border crossers in recent years — also declined steeply. Last month fewer than 1,000 children were caught at the border and fewer than 1,100 people traveling as families were found. In recent years most of the families and children traveling alone have been from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

Another report on Tuesday said the data showed a 67 percent drop in migrants seeking to cross the border.

David V. Aguilar, former U.S. Border Patrol and acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that March 2017 figures he reviewed indicate illegal border crossings are down 67 percent [compared to March 2016] …. “It’s actually up to 67 percent drop compared to last year,” Aguilar told the Senate committee.

During his eight-year tenure, former President Barack Obama reduced border barriers and allowed at least 300,000 migrants from Central America to cross the border and get temporary residency, plus work permits and access to Americans’ schools. That wave of migrants helped solidify public opposition to immigration, aided Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and helped cause many extra crimes in the United States.

However, the flow of new illegal immigrants is only a small part of the nation’s immigrant-labor oversupply.

Currently, at least 11 million illegal immigrants are living in the United States, of which at least 8 million hold jobs. Many of the recent illegal immigrants arrive legally as tourists or workers but fail to leave when their visas expire. In 2015, for example, almost 500,000 people overstayed their visas and remained for some time as illegal immigrants.

Also, the federal government annually invites 1 million people to legally immigrate to the United States, and provides work permits to a shifting population of up to 1.45 million salary-cutting white-collar guest-workers, plus at least 200,000 blue-collar contract-workers. The immigrants and contract workers compete for jobs sought by the 4 million young Americans who join the workforce each year.

Overall, the huge inflow of migrants, both legal and illegal, help lower Americans’ salaries and wages by roughly $500 billion per year. In turn, that money is scooped up by employers and Wall Street investors as higher profits.

President Trump has promised to toughen border security by building a barrier along most of the border, and he has already directed border officers to end Obama’s “catch and release” policy. He has also rejuvenated repatriation policies and has promised to curb business’ use of temporary contract workers in place of Americans.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3c1e396e:306e7f0:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Press Secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement Tuesday on the chemical attack in Syria, condemning the “heinous actions” of Bashar al-Assad against innocent people and placing blame on the former Obama Administration for “weakness and irresolution.”

Spicer read the statement to reporters in an off-camera White House briefing:

Today’s chemical attack in Syria against innocent people, including women and children, is reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration’s weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable act.

The attack on northern Idlib province, Syria has so far killed 100 and injured 400, according to a Syrian relief organization cited by the Associated Press. Another report put the death toll at 57. An initial attack appears to have been followed with airstrikes on hospitals treating those injured by the first round of the attack. Humanitarian workers on the ground have reported that the wounds of those being treated and the bodies found lifeless later on suggest the bombs made use of sarin gas, a chemical weapon prohibited by international law. Both Syria and Russia have denied responsibility for the attacks.

Asked about the Administration’s position on Syria in light of comments from the Secretary of State and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Spicer said, “I think we had opportunities in the past several years to look at regime change. I think those are fundamentally–the landscape is fundamentally different than it is today.”

In 2013, an attack in the Ghouta region left nearly 1,500 dead, more than 400 of which were children, and the U.S. attributed it to chemical weapons. The attack crossed the “red line” set by then-President Barack Obama, who had pledged to take action if the Syrian government used chemical weapons. Following the strike, the Obama administration accepted Assad’s claim that Syria had relinquished its chemical weapons arsenal, according to NPR.

Speaking of President Donald Trump, Spicer said, “He is not here to telegraph what we’re gonna do. Rest assured that I think he has been speaking with his national security team this morning and will continue to have that discussion both internally with our national security team as well as with our allies around the globe.”

“There is not a fundamental option of regime change as there has been in the past,” he told reporters, offering instead, “What we need to do is fundamentally do what we can to empower the people of Syria to find a different way.”

Asked about the timing of the attack, Spicer replied, “I think the idea that someone would use chemical weapons on their own people, including women and children, is not something that any civilized nation should sit back and accept or tolerate and I think that is what we’re making very clear today.”

Asked about any potential for Russian involvement, Spicer referred the reporter to the statement, which does not mention Russia, and his confidence in it. He reiterated that the President was briefed on the situation in Syria “extensively this morning by his national security team.”

“We did have alternatives to regime change and they weren’t taken,” Spicer said in response to a question regarding Obama’s “red line.”

President Donald Trump was warmly welcomed by union workers attending the 2017 North America’s Building Trades Union legislative conference, as he promised to restore American jobs.

“I’m not, and I don’t want to be the president of the world. I’m the president of the United States, and from now on it’s going to be America first,” Trump said as the crowd of workers applauded.

Trump criticized American leaders of the past for listening to “failed consultants” instead of the American worker, allowing their jobs to be shipped overseas.

“Washington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves,” he said. “Now it’s your turn and you’re going to be also sharing the wealth.”

Trump boasted that he stopped the Trans Pacific Partnership and would fight to renegotiate other trade deals like NAFTA that threatened American jobs. He also received applause after promoting his decision to start the Keystone pipeline.

“The era of economic surrender is over,” he said.

After taking the stage, Trump singled out each building union, prompting a rallying cry from each group of workers that it represented.

“You’re the backbone of America, with the talent in this room, we can build any city at any time and we can build it better than anyone,” Trump said.

He specifically cited the story of the Empire State Building that was constructed in just 13 months by American workers. That spirit, he asserted, would drive his economic goals going forward.

The workers laughed after Trump showed a lengthy chart of regulations and permits required to construct a highway.

“Nowadays you couldn’t even get a building permit or approval in that amount of time,” Trump said, promising to cut the regulations and permitting.

Trump reminded them that they had a builder in the Oval Office, and urged both Democrats and Republicans to come together for a massive trillion dollar infrastructure spending bill.

“Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who if given the chance can transform these communities,” he said. “You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country and I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3c1e396e:306e7ec:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

California’s State Senate passed SB 54 on Monday, rocketing the state one step closer to becoming an official “sanctuary state.”

Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León’s sanctuary bill passed on a straight party-line vote, 27-12, according to the Sacramento Bee. Strong pushback from law enforcement led to several amendments before the bill passed.

The bill was first introduced as an “urgency” measure, as De León argued the Trump administration presented a threat to those in the country illegally. The Senate President later pulled the “urgency” status to lower the standard for passage, but at the cost of delaying the bill’s implementation to January 1, 2018.

President Donald Trump has put sanctuary cities on notice that they could lose federal funding if they chose to continue to defy federal immigration authorities. In February the President called California a sanctuary state that is “out of control.”

De León declared that “half” of his family were in the United States illegally, and lashed back at Trump during an interview on KPCC 89.3. In the interview he admitted “the vast majority of immigrants” have used fraudulent Social Security numbers.

“SB 54 shields child abusers, human traffickers, and elder abusers from deportation and guarantees their return to our communities, and that’s why our fight must continue,” said State Senator Joel Anderson (R-Alpine) in an email to supporters after voting against the bill. “Over 31,000 Californians signed our petition and helped force the author to amend SB 54 so that murderers, rapists and child molesters would not be shielded from federal immigration authorities, but as long as felons are protected, we cannot stop fighting.”

Anderson called the bill “the greatest threat to dreamers,” according to the Bee.

Maryland has also been working on passing a sanctuary state law. The made national headlines in recent days on allegations that two illegal alien students had raped a young teenage girl in a school bathroom.

Last week, Attorney General. Jeff Sessions warned that sanctuary jurisdictions could lose their portion of $4.1 billion in grants from the Department of Justice if they fail to comply with federal immigration law. He said that more than 200 jurisdictions had refused to honor ICE detainer requests in just one week. “The charges and convictions against these aliens include: drug trafficking, hit and run, rape, sex offenses against a child and even murder,” said Sessions.

SB 54 now moves on to the State Assembly, where it is expected to pass and be signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown.

Using the hashtag #PutObamaUnderOath, best-selling author and political pundit Ann Coulter tweeted that while knowing the truth about Barack Obama’s National Security Advisor Susan Rice allegedly ordering surveillance of President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign aides, Obama should also testify before Congress on the matter.

“Susan Rice testimony now essential, but insufficient,” Coulter tweeted on Tuesday. “Must hear from Obama.”

Coulter also suggested in another tweet that Michelle Obama may be able to shed some light on the White House surveillance activities during her husband’s tenure.

“I don’t know if what she knows is privileged, but we need to hear from Michelle too,” Coulter tweeted.

Rice allegedly ordered surveillance of Donald Trump’s campaign aides during the 2016 presidential election, and maintained spreadsheets of their telephone calls, the Daily Caller reported.

The alleged spreadsheets add a new dimension to reports on Sunday and Monday by blogger Mike Cernovich and Eli Lake of Bloomberg News that Rice had asked for Trump aides’ names to be “unmasked” in intelligence reports.

The alleged “unmasking” may have been legal, but may also have been part of an alleged political intelligence operation to disseminate reports on the Trump campaign widely throughout government with the aim of leaking them to the press.

The surveillance and spreadsheet operation were allegedly “ordered one year before the 2016 presidential election.” According to a Fox News report on Monday, former White House aide Ben Rhodes was also involved.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3b5d76cc:2f5a605:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

California Governor Jerry Brown told Adam Nagourney of the New York Times in an interview published on Tuesday that he does not use the word “resistance” to describe his opposition to President Donald Trump, and finds it inappropriate.

“I don’t use the term resistance … That was a term I associate with the French underground and people who risked their lives. So I don’t know that that’s a fair, apt metaphor for the latest contretemps over policy,” Brown told Nagourney.

Nagourney’s article explores the efforts of Democratic politicians in California — who dominate the state’s politics — to lead the nationwide opposition to the Trump administration. The question of how, exactly, to conduct that opposition is one that divides the state party, and which is already playing into the election to succeed Brown as governor in 2018.

While some candidates, and the state legislature, are pushing for more aggressive confrontations, Nagourney notes, “a more pragmatic dynamic is emerging for Democrats who are more settled in office” and need Trump’s “cooperation.” He mentions lobbying by state and local officials for a share of Trump’s proposed spending on infrastructure projects.

An important example that escaped Nagourney’s attention is California’s reliance on the Trump administration to provide emergency relief. Already, the state has requested aid from the federal government four times since Trump took office, as it wrestles with the damage of heavy winter rains, snow and flooding. Each time, Trump has granted the aid.

Democrats — not just in California — have embraced the term “resistance.” Left-wing Jewish groups are even calling themselves the “Jewish resistance,” even though the original Jewish Resistance Movement was a right-wing militia.

President Donald Trump spoke to a group of CEOs at a White House sponsored town hall to discuss infrastructure spending and his plan to cut onerous regulations.

During the event, Trump displayed a massive chart of the regulatory permitting process for a highway.

Trump shows a list of government regulations, agencies, and permitting required to build a highway -&gt; pic.twitter.com/j9IN6z6vr3 — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) April 4, 2017

Trump previewed his plan to pass a trillion dollar infrastructure spending bill, but said he wanted companies taking the funding to start on their project within 90 days, or they wouldn’t get anything.

He also committed to shortening the regulatory and permitting process from 10-20 years down to just a year.

“We’re going to be able to get rid of 90%-95% of that and still have the same kind of protection,” he said, referring to environmental concerns.

Trump admitted that the massive regulations favored bigger builders who could afford to get through the lengthy process, but said he wanted to open it up to others.

“We’re going to cut a lot of red tape,” he promised.

Several New York CEO’s at the event specifically urged Trump to spend more money on infrastructure in the region, citing the percentage of tax dollars sent to the Federal Government.

“I love New York and in some ways, we’re all lucky that I’m from New York, because New York has unique problems,” Trump said. But he also singled out Los Angeles and Chicago as cities needing more investments.

“I am watching over everybody,” he promised.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3a9c9da9:2e33e6b:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Trump’s administration is ending U.S. funding of the United Nations Population Fund – an agency that human rights activists have linked to the support of population control programs such as China’s coercive abortion “one-child policy.”

The halt to the funding of the United Nations Population Fund – known as UNFPA – comes as Trump is scheduled this week to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

In January, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the “Mexico City Policy,” which concerns U.S. aid for abortions overseas. The president updated the policy by directing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to implement a plan that expands the policy across all global health assistance funding.

The directive means that U.S. taxpayer dollars will no longer be supporting organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program, such as that espoused by China.

A report by the Associated Press states that as a result of the end of U.S. funding of UNFPA, $32.5 million will shift to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has the goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices such as genital mutilation.

As Breitbart News reported in December 2015, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), co-chair of the Congressional Executive Committee on China, observed during a hearing, “The Chinese government is not the only one culpable in these heinous crimes against women and children. The UN Population Fund helped fund birth restrictions, fund forced abortions, and a massive and coercive family planning bureaucracy.”

“The UNFPA whitewashed China’s crimes for decades and continues to do so today,” the congressman continued, adding that on its website UNFPA “justifies its history in China, saying it was ‘tasked by the Executive Committee’ to help China and had to ‘engage with China as a sovereign nation.’”

More than a year ago, China announced that it had switched to a “two-child policy,” one that Smith said only continues the country’s longstanding attempts to control family life:

The “one-child policy” may possibly become a “two-child policy” but China’s police state population control policies will not end anytime soon. The Chinese government retains the power to tell couples what their families must look like and the power to punish those who disobey birth quotas. For the past 35 years the Chinese government has wasted precious human potential and sanctioned state-sponsored violence against women and children–enabled by pro-abortion groups globally and the United Nations Population Fund. No one should applaud China’s announced “two-child” policy; instead we should be insisting they abolish intrusive and abusive birth restrictions forever.

Trump’s reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy was criticized in February by Bill and Melinda Gates, whose foundation has as its focus the support of family planning across the globe. The Gates Foundation is also criticizing Trump’s foreign aid cuts:

“We’re concerned that this shift could impact millions of women and girls around the world,” Melinda Gates told the Guardian. “It’s likely to have a negative effect on a broad range of health programs that provide lifesaving treatment and prevention options to those most in need”:</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3a2e65c8:2d4dc82:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Angela Davis, the 1960’s radical, spoke to adoring students at Texas State University on Friday. She had a lot to say on a wide spectrum of social and political issues.

Billed as a “revolutionary icon” by the student-run newspaper, Davis packed Evans Auditorium for a “Critical Conversation with The Dr. Angela Davis: International Civil Rights Activist, Women’s Rights Activist, Author, Scholar, Historian.”

Dr. Angela Davis just took the podium to a standing ovation in Evans Auditorium #ADavisTXST pic.twitter.com/EdgCWM5Iwo — Anna Herod (@annaleemurphy) March 31, 2017

Davis’ social justice narrative included praise for Black Lives Matter and the Palestinian “plight,” but she slammed U.S. President Donald Trump, capitalism, guns, and immigration policy. She also touched upon gender and women’s issues.

“The Black Lives Matter movement could not have come at a better time,” said Davis, a hero to the movement and once considered a Black Panther activist. She shared her plans to visit with Patrisse Cullors, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter. Davis said she recently met with Black Lives Matter groups in Belfast and London. “This is here to stay.”

She riffed on the need to “resist” Trump’s presidency. “1,459 days (of Trump’s term) to go; 1,459 more days of resistance,” Davis lamented, also alleging “families are destroyed by the Trump administration’s immigration policy.”

To thunderous student applause, Davis asserted the “resistance” coalesced when “Trump was unable to repeal Obamacare” and also when “people flocked to airports spontaneously” on the first day of the Trump administration’s executive order that temporarily restricted travel from seven Middle Eastern countries. That ban was later frozen by a federal appeals court.

In 1969, UCLA fired Davis from her teaching post over her communist party membership. Although she left the party in 1991, Davis told Texas State students “diversity” can mean a difference that makes no difference at all and “I’m not interested in diversifying in the capitalist apparatus.”

Davis decried Trump as a “billionaire capitalist” and his win as “the ascendancy of the corporate (model). “He thinks he’s running a company; he’s always talking about making deals. We’re supposed to be a democracy,” she said, then cracked, “he doesn’t read.”

During her talk, the former militant also declared, “Capitalism and racism have always been intertwined.”

Davis also mused on communist contributions of the 1930’s, asking the college-age crowd, “Why do you think we have unemployment benefits now?” She said, these ideas came from communists and “people don’t know.”

Expressing strident support for the anti-Israel boycott, divest, and sanction (BDS) movement, Davis said, “We need to support” the BDS movement, and added she likes to mention “solidarity with the Palestinian struggle.” That connection, she claimed, has helped us more than we have helped the Palestinian people.

She also voiced strong anti-gun sentiments tied to her feelings against the U.S. prison system. She quipped, “I have to remind myself I’m in Texas.” She asked, “You all have a concealed carry, a campus carry, right?” She said it made her a little nervous. “There are more guns than there are people in the United States of America and there is something really wrong with that.” She said she “happens to think there is a relationship between the availability of weapons and the numbers of people who are in prison.”

“My goal is to disarm everyone, and when I say everyone, I also mean the police,” said Davis, who, in 1970, made the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted List when the feds charged her with murder, kidnapping and criminal conspiracy for purchasing guns later used by men in a prison break that turned into a San Rafael courtroom hostage situation, killing four. Davis fled. Eventually, authorities arrested her. The case became a cause celebre among progressives and she maintained the guns were stolen from her. An all-white jury eventually acquitted her, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

Skyller Walkes, Associate Director of the Office of Disability Services organized the event. Texas State listed sponsors as Disability Services, Office of the Provost and VP for Academic Affairs, Student Diversity and Inclusion, Multicultural Programs Committee, Departments of History and Philosophy, Center for Diversity and Gender Studies, and the Alliance at Texas State. Although it was calendared digitally under the Common Experience, a mandated year-long student initiative, Texas State U. spokesman Matt Flores told Breitbart Texas, Davis’ engagement was not part of that program. Flores said Davis’ $15,000 speaking fee was funded by philanthropic dollars through two discretionary funds, one from the president and the other from the provost.

In 2008, Davis retired from University of California, Santa Cruz, a Distinguished Professor Emerita in the History of Consciousness Department, Humanities Division, Feminist Studies Department. Now, she speaks on college campuses.

In 2017, Niche named UC Santa Cruz the most liberal college in California. Nationally, the campus ranked eighth. Texas State U. placed ninth most liberal college in the Lone Star State.

It was revealed Monday that President Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice allegedly ordered the unmasking of the identities of Trump campaign aides who were reportedly being surveilled during the 2016 election.

The recent reports further prove, at least in part, President Donald Trump’s claims that senior Obama officials had collected intelligence on Trump aids and disseminated it throughout the government. Rice’s involvement — as it relates to her reported role in the unmasking of Trump aids and circulating sensitive information — places the longtime Obama operative at the center of another major political scandal.

Below are five facts from Susan Rice scandals every American should know.

1. Susan Rice allegedly ordered surveillance of Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign aides as part of a political intelligence operation.

Rice allegedly maintained spreadsheets of Trump aides’ telephone calls “one year before the 2016 presidential election,” according to the Daily Caller.

The Daily Caller reports:

“What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday. “The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls.”

2. Rice claimed that climate change was responsible for the deadly civil war in Syria.

“In the years prior to civil war breaking out in Syria, that country also experienced its worst drought on record,” Rice said in October 2015, during a speech at Stanford University. “Farming families moved en masse into urban centers, increasing political unrest and further priming the country for conflict.”

Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed in the conflict since President Barack Obama drew his infamous “red line” in 2012, promising to retaliate against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime if it used chemical weapons on its own people.

3. Rice once declared that there is “no military solution” to the raging conflict in Yemen.

“As in Syria, there is no military solution to the crisis in Yemen,” Rice said in April 2015, during a speech at the Arab American Institute’s Kahlil Gibran Gala.

Seven months before Rice’s speech, President Obama had called his administration’s drone strike-driven military operation in Yemen a success story.

President Trump, however, ordered more airstrikes against al-Qaeda in Yemen in February than any year in Obama’s presidency.

4. Susan Rice said accused deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl served “with honor and distinction.”

In March 2015, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was charged with treason for allegedly deserting his fellow soldiers and abandoning his Afghanistan outpost in 2009.

In a June 2014 broadcast of ABC’s This Week, Susan Rice defended Bergdahl, saying he “served the United States with honor and distinction. And we’ll have the opportunity eventually to learn what has transpired in the past years.”

As Breitbart News reported, six soldiers lost their lives searching for then-Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl after he abandoned his outpost.

5. Susan Rice was the driving force behind a misinformation campaign about the Sept. 11, 2012, Benghazi terror attacks.

Then-UN Ambassador Rice, acting as the Obama White House’s spokeswoman, appeared on five Sunday morning talk shows and repeatedly claimed that the Benghazi attacks had been caused by an anti-Islam video.

Rice appeared on ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox News, and CNN and regurgitated talking points purporting that the protests that had erupted “spontaneously” near two U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya and were a result of a “hateful video” that was offensive to Islam.

But government documents, released following a Judicial Watch lawsuit, reveal that government officials monitoring the attack in real-time did not cite an anti-Islam video as an explanation for the paramilitary attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi.

In May 2015 interview, former Obama CIA Director Mike Morell said Rice’s Benghazi talking points blaming an anti-Islam YouTube video crossed “the line between national security and politics.”

“I think the line in there that says one of our objectives here right on the Sunday show is to blame the video rather than a failure of policy,” Morell said on Fox News’ Special Report. “And as you know, I say in the book that I think that that is crossing the line between national security and politics.”

CNN’s Chris Cuomo cautioned “New Day” viewers Tuesday to beware what he called the “fake scandal being peddled by right-wing media” that is the report that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice was behind the unmasking of identities of members of the Trump transition team.

According to Cuomo, there is “no evidence of any wrongdoing.”

“So President Trump wants you to believe that he is the victim of a ‘crooked scheme.’ Those are his words. And here are our words: There is no evidence of any wrongdoing,” Cuomo said.

He continued, “And, in fact, if anything the [national security adviser] asking for identities was a reflection of exactly how much traffic there was involving Trump people and foreign players. The White House blasting the press for not reporting on another fake scandal being peddled by right-wing media.”

WASHINGTON—Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) signaled she might vote for the constitutional option to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which would make her the second member of the Gang of 14 to do so, and move Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) one vote closer to the 50 that he needs to make it happen.

Last week Collins said Gorsuch was “unquestionably qualified” for the Supreme Court, and that by trying to filibuster President Trump’s chosen successor to Antonin Scalia, Senate Democrats were “playing politics with judicial nominees,” damaging the Senate as an institution and in the eyes of the American people. A bipartisan majority of 55 senators have pledged to vote to confirm Gorsuch.

Now that it is official that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has the 41 votes necessary to sustain a filibuster to block Gorsuch—in fact, he now has 42, with another four undecided—Collins is suggesting she might support the constitutional option.

“First of all, I think it’s important to recognize that there is absolutely no basis for filibustering such an eminently qualified nominee,” Collins said. “And I am very troubled by the fact that the Democrats have put us in this situation.”

Senate Democrats forced through a new precedent in 2013 that filibusters do not apply to lower federal court nominees. In terms of whether she would support a procedural ruling that this precedent—the constitutional option—also applies to nominees for the Supreme Court, Collins added, “If it’s necessary in order to get him confirmed I may have to vote that way, but I certainly don’t want to.”

If Collins votes for the ruling, McConnell needs two of the following four senators to get to 50: John McCain (R-AZ), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Bob Corker (R-TN), and Lamar Alexander (R-TN). Some of them have expressed concerns, but none have taken an express position one way or the other.

Once there are 50 votes, Vice President Mike Pence can cast the tie-breaking vote to invoke the constitutional option, followed by a vote to confirm Gorsuch. A vote on the constitutional option is expected on Friday.

Anti-abortion advocates say there are no longer any “excuses” for Republicans to delay approving legislation that would end Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding.

A letter to Congress signed by 77 pro-life leaders demands a new reconciliation bill to defund the abortion giant.

“There are no excuses for inaction,” the grassroots leaders write.

House Speaker Paul Ryan placed a provision to defund the abortion giant for one year in the American Health Care Act (AHCA). That legislation, however, failed to fully repeal Obamacare and, therefore, did not gain consensus. Now, national anti-abortion leaders want Republicans and President Donald Trump to act immediately to ensure Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding is eliminated in a separate bill.

“For years promises have been made, and the time has come to deliver,” the leaders write. “We urge you to pass a reconciliation bill that redirects Planned Parenthood funds to community health centers before the April recess.”

The abortion industry – aided by its political and media allies – have attempted to create the narrative that Planned Parenthood is a provider of “women’s healthcare,” when its primary service is abortion.

Lila Rose, president of Live Action, explains:

Anti-abortion leaders are seeking to have Planned Parenthood’s current taxpayer funding redirected to other community healthcare centers that provide more comprehensive care and also outnumber the abortion chain’s clinics by at least 20 to 1.

According to the Susan B. Anthony List, “The proposal to redirect taxpayer funding from Planned Parenthood would result in a $422 million increase in federal funding for community health care centers,” which currently serve at least 24.3 million people.

In the Senate, Republican Sens. Susan Collins (ME) and Lisa Murkowski (AK) have stood with Democrats to keep Planned Parenthood funded, stating concerns about women not having sufficient access to health care.

“Some contend that other health providers – such as community health centers – could fill the gap in family planning and other women’s health services if federal funding were to be cut off to Planned Parenthood,” Collins said in 2015. “If we were to defund Planned Parenthood, other family planning clinics in Maine – including community health centers – would see a 63 percent increase in their patient load.”

The Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) reveals, however, that only four Planned Parenthood clinics exist in Collins’ state of Maine, while 172 community healthcare centers that provide more comprehensive care are available throughout the entire state.

Similarly, Murkowski said prior to consideration of the AHCA bill that contained the provision to defund the abortion business, “I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health services that Planned Parenthood provides.”

CLI shows, however, that only four Planned Parenthood clinics exist, as well, in Murkowski’s state of Alaska, while 165 community healthcare centers are available throughout that state.

Trump made four promises to his pro-life constituents:

Nominating pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court

Signing into law the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would end painful late-term abortions nationwide

Defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions and reallocating their funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care for women

Making the Hyde Amendment permanent law to protect taxpayers from having to pay for abortions

“You have a clear path to accomplish this goal,” the anti-abortion leaders continue in the letter. “Pass a reconciliation bill that cuts off the largest funding streams for Planned Parenthood. Moreover, Congress has the votes to get it done now, and President Trump has promised his signature.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3951b5a9:2be52ad:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Department of Veterans Affairs continues to add new jobs available at the agency following its temporary exemption from President Donald Trump’s federal hiring freeze.

The agency is nonetheless a long way from filling what VA Secretary David Shulkin told lawmakers amounts to as many as 45,000 vacant positions, multiple media outlets are reporting.

On March 13, Shulkin issued a memorandum adding 60 job titles to the list of vacant posts, including openings at Arlington Cemetery, in cybersecurity, law enforcement, and criminal investigations, Stars and Stripes reported.

The memo also added more positions at the Veterans Crisis Line, a service that offers confidential support for veterans.

In all, the memo increased freeze-exempt jobs to 156, but “it was unclear… how many more of the 45,000 vacancies could be filled based on Shulkin’s memo. However, depending on how many vacancies there are for each job title, there could be hundreds, possibly thousands, of additional positions exempt from the hiring freeze,” Stars and Stripes reported.

In December, a Government Accountability Office report found that the agency has “systemic, long-standing human capital challenges,” and Congress has called on the VA to increase staff to serve veterans better.

In February, the GAO said the VA would remain on its “high risk” list of areas of the federal government prone to waste and mismanagement and in need of more oversight.

Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA), who sits on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, introduced legislation that would completely exempt the VA from the hiring freeze, but the legislation has yet to be taken up, according to Stars and Stripes.

When asked by National Public Radio about filling such a vast amount of openings at the agency Shulkin said that negative publicity about the agency hampers hiring.

“Well, we have about 360,000 employees in the VA health care system,” Shulkin told NPR’s Morning Edition. “It’s the largest health care system in the country, and we have many job openings.”

Shulkin said;

This is actually something you see across America, particularly in rural America, where there’s a shortage of health care professionals.We’re out actively trying to recruit many health care professionals… and the negative attention that’s been put on VA has hurt the morale of our work force. So what we’re trying to do is get people to understand that when they come to work at VA, this is really a terrific place to work. It’s filled with dedicated professionals, we’re doing great work every day, it’s a way to serve your country and we want people to come join us.

According to the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, 453,000 veterans were unemployed in 2016. The unemployment rate in 2016 was 4.2 percent for male veterans and five percent for female veterans.

“In 2016, 20.9 million men and women were veterans, accounting for about nine percent of the civilian noninstitutional population age 18 and over,” the BLS noted in its press release.

According to BLS, “In 2016, the unemployment rate of veterans varied across the country, ranging from 1.8 percent in Indiana to 7.6 percent in the District of Columbia.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b391aa4f6:2b7f3d4:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On the day the H-1B visa program is open for applications by employers, mostly from the tech industry, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is warning companies not to replace American workers with foreign help.

In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ DOJ laid down a more aggressive tone on the issue of the H-1B visa’s long history of being used to outsource Americans’ jobs to cheaper, foreign workers that are brought to the U.S.

“The Justice Department will not tolerate employers misusing the H-1B visa process to discriminate against U.S. workers,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Civil Rights Division said in the statement. “U.S. workers should not be placed in a disfavored status, and the department is wholeheartedly committed to investigating and vigorously prosecuting these claims.”

While the Immigration and Nationality Act is meant to prohibit discrimination against American workers solely because of their citizenship, the H-1B foreign guest worker visa has defied those rules for decades.

Under the H-1B visa, 85,000 new foreign workers are brought to the U.S. every year, often taking once high-paying jobs from Americans who are fired and forced to train their replacements.

If the H-1B visa program had never been introduced and enacted, computer science job availability in the labor market would be up 11 percent and wages in the tech industry would have increased by five percent, Breitbart News reported.

The H-1B visa remains incredibly unpopular with American voters. As Breitbart Texas reported, only 30 percent of Americans say companies bringing in foreign workers to fill jobs are necessary. Some 44 percent said those foreign workers take jobs away. The vast majority of Americans also said the number of H-1B visas allotted every year to companies should either be decreased or kept at the current levels.

While President Donald Trump has signaled support for legislation that would raise the minimum salary for H-1B visa workers, the White House has not taken any steps thus far to reform the program, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Trump’s nominee to lead the Labor Department, Alexander Acosta, curiously told Congress last month that it was “not the intent” of the visa to replace Americans with foreigners, as Breitbart Texas reported.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that the media was downplaying the news revealing that former President Obama’s national security advisor Susan Rice unmasked the identities of Trump campaign aides during the 2016 election.

“I’m somewhat surprised in terms of the level of interest that I’ve seen from the press corps, one set of developments versus another set of developments,” Spicer said during the White House press briefing on Monday.

Since President Donald Trump accused former President Obama’s administration of spying on his campaign staff, journalists have demanded evidence to back up his claims. Spicer suggested that the media was approaching the issue with a double standard after Rice’s activity was exposed.

“I’m somewhat more from a media standpoint somewhat intrigued by the lack of interest that we’ve seen in some of these public revelations and reporting that has gone in that direction that we’ve seen in some of the other directions that we’ve seen,” he said.

Spicer declined to comment about the new revelations, citing the ongoing investigation.

“There’s a troubling direction that some of this is going in, but we’re going to let this review go on before we jump to it,” he said.

In the aftermath of the news, some reporters suggested that Rice was merely doing her job by unmasking Trump’s National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.

“If victim Flynn hadn’t been ‘unmasked’ — would Trump had fired him? Would it be better to have ‘masked’ man Flynn running NSC?” New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush asked on Twitter. “’Unmasking’ sounds better than ‘we picked a national security adviser who was on the payroll of 2 other countries.’”

Trump has not reacted to questions about the revelations in the press and has not shared his opinion about the news on Twitter.

Spicer said that the administration would not try to assign a motive to Rice’s reported behavior, but wait to see the results of the investigation.

“We’re not going to start going down guessing the motives of something that is not assumed in fact yet,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b38ff0982:27f33a8:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A hacking group with links to the Islamic State released a video urging supporters to assassinate anyone on their list of 8,787 names, which includes celebrities, politicians, religious leaders, and President Donald Trump.

The group, known as the United Cyber Caliphate (UCC) hacking group linked to the Islamic State, urges “lone wolf” attackers to kill anyone on the list, claiming that they will soon publish the home addresses of those involved. 7,848 of the 8,787 people named on the list are Americans.

“We have a message to the people of the US and most importantly your President Trump,” the message reads.

“Know that we continue to wage war against you. Know that your counter attacks only make us stronger. The UCC will start a new step in this war against you. So expect us soon Insha Allah!” the message continues.

It is not the first time that the UCC has released kill lists targeting American civilians. Last June, the organization unveiled a list of approximately 2,000 people with little or no connection to the U.S. government.

Donald Trump has previously been featured in ISIS-related propaganda, with footage of him describing Brussels as a “horror show” used in a video produced by pro-ISIS group al-Battar.

According to Vocativ, a number of pro-ISIS hacking groups are not necessarily committing the hacking themselves, instead taking credit for others work or simply accessing publicly held information. Counterterrorism officials have yet to determine whether the threats presented by the group are credible.

Former FBI agent-turned-lawyer Stuart Kaplan warned last year, just days before the Orlando nightclub massacre, that “lone wolf” supporters of the Islamic State and other jihadist groups pose an especially difficult danger to the population for police to prevent.

“Should a sympathizer get hold of a list and can readily able to identify you as being his neighbor and, then, decides to go out and do something horrific to you, there is no way to calculate the potential or to prevent that,” he told CBS12 at the time.

The new list also comes amidst a number of ISIS-inspired terror attacks in major cities across the Western world, most recently in St. Petersburg, London, and Berlin.

Alabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks told reporters attacks by President Donald Trump and other members of the White House staff upon members of the House Freedom Caucus and fellow Republicans during the recent fight over the star-crossed American Health Care Act have hurt his relationship with the American people.

“I don’t believe that it is very productive for the Trump White House to attack Republicans, and I think that is reflected in how his job performance and personal popularity numbers have been on the decline since he did that,” said the congressman, who had just left a meeting hosted by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) with other members of the House Freedom Caucus about moving forward with reforms to the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

The administration needs to take a different approach. It needs to be professionally done–focusing in public policy and legislation,” he said.

Brooks also said he was uncomfortable discussing what happened at the meeting.

“Donald Trump is a pretty good golfer,” he said. The congressman was referring to Sunday’s foursome at the Trump National Golf Club —Sterling, Virginia — when the president golfed with Paul, White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney, and one other.

I had a great time today with @realDonaldTrump and believe we are getting closer to an agreement on health care! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) April 2, 2017

The legislative vehicle Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) presented as the only way to repeal-and-replace Obamacare was the American Health Care Act, or Ryancare. The House Freedom Caucus was in talks with the White House when Ryan pulled the Ryancare bill from the House floor March 24, nearly 15 minutes before the beginning of a roll call vote that Ryan was sure to lose.

A Capitol Hill source familiar with the House Freedom Caucus told Breitbart News that even after the cancelled vote, members of the HFC have continued discussions with the White House about fixing Obamacare, which Ryan and other members of the House Republican leadership describe as being in a “death spiral,” because of its unsustainable business model.

“I am more than happy to consider any health care bill that will reduce the cost of insurance premiums to American citizens,” Brooks said.

Not only does the Ryancare bill create conditions that will see premiums continue to go up; the bill also creates a new welfare entitlement through income tax credits for Americans with no tax liability.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b376163aa:2582548:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">&quot;This is one of the most ridiculous presidencies I’ve ever seen,&quot; @kingsthings told @JohnFugelsang of his friend Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/17X6fo7n7J

On on SiriusXM’s “Tell Me Everything,” Russia Today host Larry King said “so far” President Donald Trump’s time in office has been “one of the most ridiculous presidencies” he had ever seen.

King said, “It’s almost funny. To run the Environmental Protection Agency, he hires an anti-environment guy. To run the Secretary of Education, he hires someone who doesn’t like education. Doesn’t like public schools. That’s weird, man.”

He continued, “There is something crazed about it. And a lot of his opinions— He cuts State Department by 32%. He gets us out of Climate change Who doesn’t notice climate change? Come on.”

King added, “I gotta admit that so far, this is one of the most ridiculous presidencies I have ever seen.”

WASHINGTON,D.C.—Monday it became official that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has the necessary 41 senators publicly committed to filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court, meaning that now the future of the nation’s highest court hangs on Republicans getting 50 votes for the constitutional option.

Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In conjunction with the committee vote on Gorsuch—who was recommended favorably to the Senate by a party-line 11-9 vote—Coons announced that he would join Schumer’s filibuster.

Coons is a liberal Democrat, but had previously signaled that he might consider some sort of negotiated outcome regarding the way forward for the high Court. So while his announcement was not unexpected, it was still vitally important.

With Coons, there are now 41 votes for a filibuster. It takes 60 votes to stop a filibuster in the 100-member Senate, so Coons became the magic number that puts Schumer over the top.

Under current Senate practice, that body’s rules are interpreted such that President Trump’s nomination of Gorsuch would now die, despite having a bipartisan majority of at least 55 senators who would vote for him if his confirmation comes to a final vote.

Now all eyes are on Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), to see if he can keep enough of his 52 Republicans together to invoke the constitutional option, and restore the 200-year Senate practice of judicial nominees only requiring a simple majority vote to be confirmed to their lifetime appointments.

The White House released its first official photo of First Lady Melania Trump, the Daily Mail reported.

The image shows the first lady in front of the White House residence, wearing a black jacket, black scarf, and showcasing a diamond ring President Trump bought her for their 10th anniversary.

In the image, she looks straight into the camera and is standing in front of one of the arched windows of the residence.

Photographer Regine Mahaux took the photo the day after the inauguration on January 20, the Hill reported.

Melania Trump currently divides her time between Trump Tower in New York City and the White House in Washington, D.C. so her son Barron can finish up the school year at his school in New York.

The first lady recently made her way back to D.C. when she handed out awards at the 2017 International Women of Courage awards ceremony Wednesday at the State Department.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b372a25f8:283e7e4:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Comedy Central is set to debut a new weekly late night series, The President Show, that will see comedian Anthony Atamanuik play a parody President Donald Trump who will address the American people straight from the Oval Office.

The new show, created by Atamanuik, will premier on Thursday, April 27 and will reportedly run weekly if it becomes a ratings success.

“When I was first approached about this show I thought it would be about me, but on further thought, this makes way more sense,” Comedy Central president Kent Alterman said.

Comedy Central released a short video clip on Monday, which offers a glimpse of what audiences can expect from Atamanuik’s parody Trump.

.@LateNightDonald makes a surprising announcement. No, he&apos;s not resigning. #PresidentShowpic.twitter.com/9u5toBgxSh — The President Show (@PresidentShow) April 3, 2017

“They unzipped my pants. They got on their knees, it was disgusting,” Atamanuik says, surrounded by a gaggle of reporters on Air Force One. “And I would get incredible ratings, some of the best ratings, huge ratings. Great ratings, ok? And they’d say, You want to be on the same channel as Noah Trevor, or whatever the guy’s name is. Who cares? Whatever. I said just invite me on and be nice.”

“I’ll have the best guests, the most beautiful women. It will be so funny, the most funny show,” he says.

Atamanuik has made something of a career out of lampooning the president.

The 30 Rock alum has performed his Trump impersonation on The View, CNN’s Newsroom, and on a 40-city Trump vs. Bernie debate comedy tour that aired on Fusion.

“Laughing at the President is a proud American tradition and we hope not to disappoint anyone in that department,” Atamanuik said in a statement. “But our political system is too broken for us to be content joking about one man, even though he is a disastrous silly little toddler boy. Mostly I’d just like to thank Comedy Central for giving us this platform to speak truth to power and if we’re lucky, end up in prison!”

Rand Paul (R-KY) told reporters Monday afternoon that former Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice “ought to testify under oath” after Bloomberg News’s Eli Lake revealed that, during the presidential transition, she deliberately sought to “unmask” President Donald Trump’s associates from intelligence surveillance.

Paul called the reports that Rice made dozens of requests to learn more about the identities of anonymous people thought to be close to the Trump transition team, inadvertently caught on tape during investigations into foreign persons of intelligence interest, “enormous news.”

“If it is allowed, we shouldn’t be allowing it. I don’t think we should discount how big a deal it is that Susan rice was looking at these,” Paul told the assembled reporters.

The Kentucky Senator then cut to the heart of the growing political fight behind what President Trump has called “wiretapping.”

“She needs to be asked, ‘did President Obama ask her to do this?’ I think she ought to testify under oath on this,” Paul opined.

Paul also tried to tie Monday’s revelations about Rice to the slew of leaks on the topic around the time of the handover of the White House. “I think she should be asked under oath, did she reveal it to the Washington Post?” he asked.

Paul, long a critic of this type of warrentless intelligence wiretapping and its potential to capture the communications of American citizens, was quick to tie the issues together. “I don’t think you should be allowed to listen to Americans’ conversations without a warrant,” Paul said. “They are targeting a foreigner, and because they are targeting a foreigner they are gathering all of this information on Americans.”

“A million Americans are apparently caught up in these incidental conversations,” Paul continued. “Everybody in the Trump Administration transition, they could basically look at those conversations.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3684cc81:246f1a0:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Former Late Show host David Letterman says he has been enjoying “doing nothing” since leaving the long-running CBS show, and laughs off people who say his enormous beard makes him look like a “vagrant.”

“People make fun of this beard — they think I look like a vagrant. I’ll tell you something, I have cut my shaving time to zero,” the former Late Night show host told TMZ in an impromptu interview in New York City.

Of his Late Show successor Stephen Colbert — whose ratings have soared in recent months as his show has taken an increasingly hostile tone toward President Donald Trump — Letterman said “he’s a gifted young entertainer.”

Letterman added that “it would kill” him to have to host his old show.

“Everyday, day after day after day, no. I couldn’t keep up,” he said.

While Letterman may be enjoying retirement, he hasn’t let his absence from late night stop him from bashing President Donald Trump.

The former CBS star’s last show aired two months before Trump announced his presidential bid. Letterman told New York magazine last month that the president is “insulting to America.”

“How do you know if Donald Trump is lying? His lips are moving. Thank you!” Letterman said. “But in addition to every other thing that’s wrong with the Trump, he’s ignorant in a way that’s insulting to the office, insulting to America, insulting to human rights, insulting to civil rights, insulting to John Lewis. Trump saying that broke my heart.”

This article was updated to reflect that Late Show airs on CBS.

Fashion model Bella Hadid opened up about her upbringing as the daughter of a refugee in a magazine interview this week, explaining that President Donald Trump’s proposed immigration policy hits “close to home” for her.

“My dad was a refugee when he first came to America, so it’s actually very close to home for my sister and brother and me,” the 20-year-old model — who has posed for campaigns for Fendi, Dior, DKNY and other fashion brands — told Porter magazine for its summer issue, according to preview excerpts in the Daily Mail.

“He was always religious, and he always prayed with us,” Hadid said of her father, Mohamed Hadid, a real estate developer who was born in Palestine and reportedly lived in Syria and Lebanon before immigrating to America. “I am proud to be a Muslim.”

Hadid and her older sister Gigi, 21, have quickly become some of the most sought-after models in fashion.

The two have even worked together on some shoots, including for Moschino’s Spring 2017 campaign.

‘People think we’re the same and that we’ve been working just as long, but I’m two years behind her,” Hadid told Porter of her relationship with her sister. “I still have a long time to catch up!”

The supermodel sisters have also become fierce critics of President Trump’s proposed immigration policies.

In January, the Hadids were photographed participating in a New York City rally to protest Trump’s proposal to temporarily halt immigration from a number of terror-prone countries.

In November, Gigi Hadid came under fire on social media for performing what some critics called a “disrespectful” impression of First Lady Melania Trump during the American Music Awards.

The model later apologized, saying the impression had been done “in good humor and with no bad intent.”

Porter‘s summer issue is due out April 7.

The latest attack against President Donald Trump for allegedly being too close to his and his family’s business interests suffers from a serious flaw: it is based on a trust agreement provision authorized by law and recommended by the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics as well as the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.

The website ProPublica reported Monday that the documents governing the trust that holds Trump’s businesses were changed in February to instruct the trustee to make distributions to Trump when requested. “Trump can draw money from his more than 400 businesses, at any time, without disclosing it,” ProPublica explained.

According to ProPublica, this shows “just how little separation there actually is” between the Trump businesses and the U.S. government.

To anyone familiar with the blind trust agreements signed by government officials, however, this is nonsense. Almost every trust agreement signed by U.S. government officials authorizes distributions upon request of the official for whom the trust is established.

The sample blind trust agreement distributed by the staff of the Senate Ethics Committee is the model document used by senators and their staffs for setting up trusts. It authorizes precisely the kind of requests for distributions that has ProPublica scandalized. Section 7 of the agreement reads:

There shall be no direct or indirect communication between an interested party and the Trusteee with respect to the Trust unless– (A) It related to a request for a distribution from the Trust of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust or…

Importantly, this is the only form of communication with the Trustee that doesn’t require written disclosure with the Ethics Committee. Just like Trump’s trust, the Senate model trust doesn’t require disclosure of requests for distributions.

The Office of Government Ethics, an independent agency within the executive branch, uses very similar language in its model blind trust agreement.

SEVENTH: There shall be no direct or indirect communication between an interested party or 21 any representative of an interested party and the Trustee with respect to the Trust unless the 22 communication is in writing and has the prior written approval of the Director, U.S. Office of 23 Government Ethics, and unless it relates only – (A) To a request for a distribution of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust…

There’s a very good reason why both agreements allow government officials to request distributions from their trusts without requiring any prior disclosure: that’s what the law says. The requirements for a blind trust for government officials are set out in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The law bars most communications between government officials and their trustees but it explicitly allows for requests for distributions.

…except for communications which solely consist of requests for distributions of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust, there shall be no direct or indirect communication between the trustee and an interested party with respect to the trust unless such communication is in writing and unless it relates only [to certain permitted topics].

In other words, the authorization of undisclosed requests from distributions in Trump’s trust agreement is fully in keeping with the law and the government’s standard agreements. The small change revealed by ProPublica brought Trump’s trust into further conformity with the trusts used by other government officials and U.S. senators.

This is just another Gold Easter Egg: a story that falsely depicts something as a scandal because Trump does it when it is, in fact, totally normal.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b36321b3c:24004c4:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Actor Alec Baldwin has opened up about his personal and professional life in a new memoir that reveals the regrets and pain with which he says he has learned to live.

In an appearance Monday on Good Morning America to promote the new book, titled Nevertheless, the 30 Rock alum and newly minted Saturday Night Live star told host George Stephanopoulos that a 2007 voicemail to his daughter Ireland — subsequently leaked to the media — caused a “permanent break” in their relationship.

“It’s thrown in your face every day,” Baldwin said of the audiotape that made headlines nearly ten years ago. The voicemail caught Baldwin calling his then-11-year-old daughter a “rude, thoughtless little pig.”

“There are people who admonish me, or attack me, and use that as a constant spearhead to do that,” the actor said. “It’s a scab that never heals because it’s been picked at all the time by so many people. I think my daughter, that’s hurt her in a permanent way.”

It seems, however, that the Boss Baby star and his daughter have put the incident behind them.

In 2015, they posed in a photo together seemingly making light of the voicemail incident.

If I Were A Pig… I would be Rude and Thoughtless of course! 🐽 A post shared by Ireland Basinger-Baldwin (@irelandbasingerbaldwin) on Jul 26, 2015 at 11:36am PDT

… I&apos;d be rude and thoughtless. That&apos;s the only pig to be. A post shared by Alec Baldwin (@iamabfalecbaldwin) on Jul 26, 2015 at 11:16am PDT

Ireland also addressed the 10-year-old scandal, telling Page Six in 2012 that she thought the situation was “blown out of proportion.”

“The only problem with that voicemail was that people made it out to be a way bigger deal than it was,” she told the outlet in 2012. “He’s said stuff like that before just because he’s frustrated. For me it was like, ‘OK, whatever.’ I called him back I was like, ‘Sorry, Dad, I didn’t have my phone.’ That was it.”

Baldwin has been busy playing President Donald Trump during the 42nd and 43rd seasons of Saturday Night Live. The 59-year-old actor said recently that he was preparing to retire his Trump impression.

President Donald Trump has donated the first quarter of his presidential salary to the Department of the Interior to help fund the National Parks.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke joined White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer who gave the check to Zinke, displaying it on a digital screen in the briefing room.

Zinke said that the additional funds would help maintain infrastructure of some of the national battlefield sites.

“We’re about $100 million or $229 million behind in deferred maintenance on our battlefields alone and that’s on our 25 national battlefields,” he said. “We’re excited about that opportunity.”

According to Spicer the check, that was made out for $78,333 was “every penny” that Trump received since his inauguration as president.

“The Park Service has cared for our parks since 1916, and the president is personally proud to contribute the first quarter of his salary to the important mission of the Park Service,” Spicer said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b35fb00eb:269b7a2:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Mainstream media are watching their Russia election-meddling narrative teeter on the brink of collapse. They’re holding their collective breath hoping it doesn’t topple over, like the world’s highest stakes game of Jenga.

Every week the Russia story crumbles a bit more. Whether it is the loss of credibility of Crowdstrike’s hacking report, or the revelation by WikiLeaks that the CIA can make a cyber attack look like it came from wherever they want, the leftist media can’t catch a break. The FBI and NSA have both testified that there is no evidence that there was any hacking of actual voting, and the WikiLeaks allegations throw doubt on Russia’s involvement in hacking the DNC or Podesta emails. Even if they did, the media and the Democrats still have yet to convince anyone that the emails are the reason that voters chose Trump in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Despite this, the media zealously chase after every angle of the story, mostly using “anonymous sources” and “individuals familiar with the investigation.”

Well, they chase almost every angle on the Russia story — except for the very real connections between the Clinton campaign and Russia.

The media keep the Russia story at the presidential level, failing to provide any sort of context for Trump’s win. The Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the federal and state level during Obama’s presidency, including 9 Senate seats, 62 House seats, 12 governorships, and a startling 958 state legislative seats. Did the Russians have a hand in all of those elections? Or are those election results clear signals of America’s shift away from Obama and Clinton, who promised to be a third Obama term?

In the business world, feverishly pouring resources and time into a bad product in the hopes of validating past investments is called the sunk cost fallacy. Is that what is motivating the mainstream media to keep churning out their Russian “election hacking” coverage? Or is there another reason? Perhaps they are so masochistic as to enjoy President Trump sticking his thumb in their eye via Twitter:

It is the same Fake News Media that said there is &quot;no path to victory for Trump&quot; that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017

While they continue to desperately push stories about Russia, the mainstream media remain practically silent on the story they should be focusing on — the surveillance of Donald Trump and his campaign staff by the Obama administration. Unless the media want to portray Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) as a paranoid schizophrenic (Breitbart News wouldn’t put it past them), we now have strong indications that President Obama and his staff surveilled Trump and staff. This may or may not have been illegal, but certainly was cheating by any definition.

The revelations about this spying are coming fast and thick. On Thursday, Kimberly Strassel outlined some of the key allegations in The Wall Street Journal:

First, there were dozens of documents with information about Trump officials. Second, the information these documents contained was not related to Russia. Third, while many reports did “mask” identities (referring, for instance, to “U.S. Person 1 or 2”) they were written in ways that made clear which Trump officials were being discussed. Fourth, in at least one instance, a Trump official other than Mr. Flynn was outright unmasked. Finally, these documents were circulated at the highest levels of government.

More news is already breaking on on the unmasking front — Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, has been reported as the official who requested the unmasking. This followed a Fox News report that a “very senior” official had made the requests. The headlines about Rice began following a post by Mike Cernovich naming her, along with broadcasts by him on Periscope, Twitter’s video streaming application.

The media’s response to this story was immediate. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the response we’d hope for — a hard-hitting investigation into why Americans were under surveillance completely unrelated to questions about Russian connections. Instead, the media have been attacking Nunes with everything they’ve got.

MSNBC host Joe Scarborough tweeted, “If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman.” He later said on his program “It is so obvious that this guy is getting bullied by the White House.” Will he next say Congress needs millions for anti-bully training?

CNN’s Jake Tapper joined the party with a contentious interview of Nunes, including the stunning phrase: “Some question your impartiality.” For anyone associated with CNN to say that with a straight face is quite astonishing. As a thought experiment, what if we replaced Woodward and Bernstein with Tapper and Scarborough? Would Watergate have played out differently? I expect most of their energies would have been spent unmasking Deep Throat for his audacity in finding and sharing the truth, not to mention the patriarchal sexism of his code name!

The rest of the media has been following suit. From parroting Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) saying that Nunes acted inappropriately, to the general Democrat talking points that Nunes must step down as Intel Chair, the mainstream media would have us believe that ABC News breathlessly reporting that Nunes refuses to step down from the committee is journalism at its finest.

We know that “Nunes must step down” holds as much weight as the Russia story does, so Breitbart News along with our compatriots outside of the mainstream media bubble will continue to follow the Trump surveillance story with accurate reporting and insightful analysis. President Trump will continue to run circles around the biased media as he did this weekend, dominating headlines by lambasting NBC’s “Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd.”

You may be left wondering, “What will the mainstream media do?” They will certainly continue pounding the rapidly fading Russia-Trump story and do their best to avoid the surveillance of Trump story. They will also continue bemoaning their loss of paying customers.

A Gallup poll in September of 2016 found that 68 percent of Americans distrust the media. How would that number look today? Following months of uninterrupted media coverage of unproven Russian meddling, media distrust will likely be higher today than six months ago. In fact, the numbers are probably so bad that the mainstream media will have no choice but to claim Russia hacked the poll.

Former New Hampshire Republican senator Kelly Ayotte told Breitbart News it is not true that Judge Neil Gorsuch would not meet with Senate Democrats while he paid visits to senators after President Donald Trump nominated him Feb.1 to serve on the Supreme Court.

“Judge Gorsuch met with 80 senators,” said Ayotte, who was asked by the White House to shepherd Gorsuch through her old workplace, where she served with all but seven of the senators expected to vote on the Gorsuch nomination before the end of the week.

The Nevada Independent reported Thursday that Democratic freshman Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto said Gorsuch dodged meeting with her:

“Unfortunately, after requesting a meeting with the Judge for several weeks, he has refused to honor this request,” Cortez Masto said. “The U.S. Constitution has entrusted the Senate with the role of advising the President on the highest court of the land and in refusing to meet with me, he has disrespected our nation’s founding principles and pillars core to our democratic institutions.”

Ayotte said she and her staff reached out to every senator, both Republican and Democrat, about meeting the judge nominated to replace Justice Antonin Scalia.

“As for Senator Cortez Masto? We reached out to her beginning in February,” Ayotte said.

The former senator said Cortez-Masto’s scheduler told her that the Nevada senator was unavailable for a month.

Ayotte said that, while the judge is spending time with his family pending his potential ascension to the high court, if there were still Senate Democrats looking to speak with Gorsuch before the vote, she would attempt to make it happen.

Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines 11-9 to approve the nomination and move the nomination to the Senate floor.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b35df72fa:2672a87:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Senate Judiciary Committee, in a party-line 11-9 vote Monday, has passed Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s nominee to replace conservative stalwart Justice Antonin Scalia, setting up a full Senate confirmation vote for April 7.

The vote sets the stage for a clash on Senate rules for Supreme Court nominees. At least forty-one Senate Democrats, now including Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), whose state President Trump won by over twenty points, and Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Mark Warner (D-VA) and Diane Feinstein (D-CA), who announced their opposition to Gorsuch at the hearing, have now expressed their intention to initiate the first partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in American history.

Despite Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), who told the Colorado Independent that he will not filibuster his fellow Coloradan Gorsuch, and three Democrats who have said they will support Gorsuch, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) now appears to have the votes needed to prevent a vote for cloture and a full Senate vote on Gorsuch’s confirmation under current rules.

Senate Democrats changed Senate rules in 2013 to allow a simple majority to trigger a full Senate vote on non-Supreme Court nominees. Increasing numbers of Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), appear poised to use the same “Constitutional Option” for Supreme Court nominees in order to ensure Gorsuch’s confirmation.

During Monday’s final Judiciary Committee meeting on Gorsuch, Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) reiterated Republican willingness to revert to the constitutional option. “We’ve had one successful filibuster of a Supreme Court Nominee, that was that was bipartisan with Abe Fortas. By the end of the week, that will still be the case,” he told the committee with a smile.

Democrats on the Committee used their final opportunity to air their grievances with Trump’s pick for the high court. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) went so far as to call the Federalist Society, an association of conservative lawyers that endorsed Gorsuch, a “special interest group” and launched into an extended diatribe against the validity of judicial originalism, the idea that the constitution and laws ought to be interpreted according to the original intentions of the drafters. Durbin quoted the late liberal Supreme Court Justice William Brennen as calling the very idea judges can find the intention of the Founders as “arrogance cloaked in humility.”

Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), who had held out on supporting the proposed filibuster and was posited as a possible partner in a deal to save the sixty-vote cloture requirement, used the Committee meeting to come out against an up or down vote on Gorsuch. “I am not ready to end debate on this issue, so I will be voting against cloture unless we are able, as a body, to find a way to sit down and avoid the ‘nuclear option,&apos;” he told the Committee.

Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) downplayed the idea the increasingly likely constitutional option to confirm Gorsuch on a simple majority vote is a stark break with Senate tradition. “I disagree with those who say this is the end of the Senate as we know it. This is a restoration of the status quo ante, before our Democratic colleagues erected this artificial sixty vote requirement.”

The Committee also approved Deputy Attorney General nominee Rod Rosenstein with some Democratic support and Rachel Brand, nominee for Associate Attorney General, along a party-line vote.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b356fe882:25d19d7:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Monday on ABC’s “The View,” co-host Joy Behar said President Donald Trump was “nuts” and needed “to be taken out of office.”

Behar said, “Everybody face it, he needs to be taken out of office. He needs to be impeached. He is a menace. You say Kim Jong — what do you call him — Kim Jong-yum-yum is crazy? So is he. So is he. Let’s Get real. Come on. He is nuts and we’re in the middle of it.”

Politico reported Thursday that President Donald Trump, chastened by his experience pushing for the failed Ryancare bill, is moving forward on tax reform with is own economic team in the lead–not Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI):

Just on Thursday, President Donald Trump huddled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, senior strategist Steve Bannon, son-in-law and consigliere Jared Kushner and staffers from the National Economic Council and Treasury to delve into the various policy trade-offs and ways to structure a plan. The key takeaway: The White House is not outsourcing these details to anyone, including the speaker of the House.

The report said White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed this new dynamic at Friday’s news briefing: “The president will put out principles, I’m sure, in terms of what his goals are and drive this as the process moves forward.”

A 14-page paper, obtained by Politico and developed during the presidential transition, is the central blueprint for the president’s tax reform program–and it would push Ryan’s own Border Adjustment Tax off the table.

The president is expected to propose cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent combined with a wiping out of the tax code’s catalog of tax loopholes and deductions Congress created to ameliorate the 35 percent rate for business profits. Another part of the plan is to simply the individual tax rates, again by lowering the rates and removing specialized deductions.

Trump’s corporate and individual tax reforms are significant, but no way near the revolutionary changes contained in Ryan’s Border Adjustment Tax, which shifts $1 trillion in annual tax burden onto exported goods and exporters. That fight has already been going on behind the scenes, as domestic manufacturers and retailers line up allies and resources as they contest for who will be on the hook for one-third of the federal government’s annual revenues.

Ryan read Capitol Hill Republicans into his 200-day schedule that would carry on through Labor Day at the GOP lawmakers’ policy retreat held in Philadelphia in the last week of January. The schedule called for the House to focus on overturning President Barack Obama’s last-minute regulations through the Congressional Review Act, while the Senate focused on confirming the first wave of Trump administration appointees.

March was dedicated to the repeal-and-replace of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

In April, the Senate would confirm the president’s choice to fill the Supreme Court seat made vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and the House would tackle reforming the tax code—a process coupled with the approval of the fiscal year 2018 budget that would consume both chambers.

In Philadelphia, Ryan had not yet revealed that he would hijack the repeal-and-replace of Obamacare with his own bill that fell short of what Republicans had expected and had promised voters in every political cycle since Obamacare became law in 2010. The Ryancare bill alienated conservatives and frightened moderate Republicans hesitant to cast a politically risky vote for a bill that might not pass the Senate.

In the end, the speaker pulled the Ryancare bill from the House floor March 24, nearly 15 minutes from the roll call that would have meant its certain defeat.

If Ryan had a working majority in the House, he would be the man driving the agenda, he but does not have that majority, so the White House is moving forward with its own agenda and its own ideas.

The aborted American Health Care Act has been portrayed as a defeat for the president, who rallied for the bill in campaign-style events outside of Washington and behind closed doors at the White House and on Capitol Hill.

Now that things have settled, it appears that instead of a setback for the president, the failure of the speaker’s health care legislation was really Trump’s liberation.

During the 2016 presidential cycle, Ryan created “The Better Way” agenda as a parallel campaign platform, so that he and his allies could campaign for themselves without mentioning the president’s name nor offer him support.

Now, Trump has found his own better way.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3538bd70:2579793:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In a letter to President Trump, an Ohio Sheriff urged him to send ICE agents to target businesses that employ illegal aliens.

Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones asked President Trump to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers to Butler County, Ohio, to begin a program of “workplace enforcement,” according to Fox 19.

“The American citizens are tired of dealing with this issue, tired of hearing on the news how an illegal alien committed a crime here and just gets to return home, tired of illegal aliens bringing and trading drugs in this country, and tired of losing jobs to companies who are willing to hire illegals and pay them far less wages,” said Jones in his letter to the President. “Our citizens are at risk to their health and physical safety every day that this country allows them to be here.”

Jones then asked President Trump to send in ICE because he believes there will be fewer people living on welfare if businesses cease hiring illegal labor.

“The American people who are forced to survive on welfare is disturbing. If we stop businesses from hiring illegal aliens, more Americans can get and maintain work,” Jones wrote.

In a recent interview with Fox Business, Jones was asked how popular his stance on immigration is in Butler County.

“It’s very popular, it’s very popular in our state. Trump won the state of Ohio even with the Governor of Ohio working against him, and never supported him,” said Jones during the interview.

When the host insinuated that what Jones is doing could be considered “nasty,” Jones fired back saying, “Hey, it’s not for sissies.”

Monday on MSNBC while discussing Senate Democrats opposition to President Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Republicans have “no other choice” than the nuclear option of lowering the 60-vote filibuster threshold for a Supreme Court nominee to a simple majority.

Partial transcript as follows:

REPORTER: Mitch McConnell, the leader is prepared to go nuclear here?

GRAHAM: Yeah. We have no other choice. We’re not going to have a tradition of the senate where they get their judges and President Trump can’t get his.

Dan Gainor, the vice president of Business and Culture at the Media Research Center, talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday regarding the recent best and worst in media, including a Los Angeles Times editorial series bashing President Trump.

Regarding the media in general, Gainor said, “The media has to be more honest, and they don’t want to be. And they don’t really want to be honest about how upset they are.”

Continued Gainor, “What we’re undergoing is what I’ve been calling in my column each week a national tantrum, and the left doesn’t want to wake up, doesn’t want to calm down. They want to celebrate the most radical factions.”

Gainor added, “That’s why you see the skewering that Mike Pence took just because he wants to have dinner with his wife.”

Gainor’s very active Twitter account is here.

President Donald Trump declined an offer from the Washington Nationals to throw out the first pitch on Opening Day. Previous presidents, such as Barack Obama and George W. Bush, had accepted the invites when offered.

Over the weekend, Pete Souza, former White House photographer to President Obama, decided to poke Donald Trump on Instagram. Souza posted a photo of former President Obama warming up for his Opening Day first pitch, a presumed reminder that Obama didn’t decline the offer:

While President Trump did decline the Nationals offer to throw out the first pitch, Citizen Trump did throw out the first pitch for the Red Sox back in 2006.

In an interview that aired on CNN from David Axelrod’s “The Axe Files,” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) shot down the notion that President Donald Trump is anything like former President Ronald Reagan.

Axelrod asked McCain if he saw the president as a “Reagan-like figure.”

“No I don’t,” McCain replied. “And I think it’s pretty clear that there’s a difference between, well, aren’t we killers and the guy that stood there and said, ‘Mr. Gorbachev, take down this wall.&apos;”

“[Reagan] spoke out for the captive nations, he spoke out for the people who were behind the Iron Curtain,” McCain continued. “And after the Iron Curtain fell, there were thousands who said, ‘I heard Ronald Reagan, I listened to the voice of America, I listened to Radio Free Europe — he gave us hope.’ That’s a pretty big difference.”

Susan Rice, who was former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, did not respond to a report from Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake that on multiple occasions, she made requests to unmask United States citizens connected to President Donald Trump’s transition team.

According to Lake, Rice did not respond to an email seeking comment on the story.

The breaking news helps confirm some of President Trump’s accusations that senior Obama officials were involved in disseminating classified information about his transition team to the media, fueling new details about the congressional investigations into Russia’s meddling in the election.

On Monday, Fox News senior correspondent Adam Housley said that the “unprecedented” unmasking took place at the direction of “very high-up” officials.

“A lot of these men and women in the intelligence communities did not want to speak about what’s going on because they were concerned about those methods being known,” Housley reported. “But now, they figure they might as well at least clarify things since Nunes has been leaked to by someone they don’t know or at least they tell me they don’t know.”

Susan Rice has not denied the allegations, saying only, “I know nothing about this” when asked about the reports last month on PBS.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3477ca94:2424dfd:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump signaled his willingness to take on North Korea, regardless of whether China was willing to help the United States.

“If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you,” Trump said in an interview with the Financial Times.

When asked if he could do it without China’s help, Trump replied, “Totally.”

Trump’s remarks signal a tough stance on the rogue nation ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit at Mar-a-lago this weekend. In recent years, American presidents looked to China to help contain the threat posed by North Korea.

“China has great influence over North Korea and China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won’t,” Trump said. “And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don’t it won’t be good for anyone.”

North Korea routinely conducted weapons tests during the Obama administration, but officials took a policy of “strategic patience.”

Trump’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signaled that things would change in the new administration.

“Let me be very clear: the policy of strategic patience has ended,” Tillerson said during a news conference in South Korea last month. “We are exploring a new range of security and diplomatic measures. All options are on the table.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3477ca94:2424df8:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump plans to nominate Carlos G. Muñiz, a former attorney to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, as general counsel to the U.S. Education Department (USED).

Muñiz is senior vice president for the firm McGuireWoods, based in Tallahassee, Florida.

According to his biography, Muñiz “provides senior level insight and advocacy for clients in their interaction with state attorneys general throughout the country and with the executive and legislative branches of Florida state government.”

“Carlos has experience in matters involving myriad industries, including financial services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and education,” his bio further states.

Muñiz also served as deputy attorney general and chief of staff to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. He earned degrees from the University of Virginia and Yale Law School.

Other U.S. Education Department staff who have worked for Bush at his foundation include Neil Ruddock, former regional advocacy director at FEE, and Josh Venable, who is now “senior advisor to the secretary” at USED.

Bush lost the GOP primary in 2016, in part because of his vocal support for the Common Core standards. U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos contributed financially and served as a board member of Bush’s pro-Common Core Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE).</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3477ca94:2424df7:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON – President Trump will look to “reboot” the U.S.-Egyptian relationship when he welcomes Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi to the White House on Monday.

“He wants to use president al-Sisi’s visit to reboot the bilateral relationship and build on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September,” a senior administration official told reporters on background ahead of the visit.

The meeting is expected to focus on countering terrorism in Egypt and the region, as well as U.S. financial support to Egypt to counter it.

The President will meet with al-Sisi in the Oval Office, before leading an expanded bilateral meeting with him in the Cabinet Room. He will then have a working luncheon with the Egyptian president in the State Dining Room.

It will be the second time they have spoken since Trump’s inauguration. The two spoke via phone on Jan. 23.

It will be the first time in seven years since an Egyptian head of state visited the White House, according to David Schenker, Aufzien Fellow and director of the Program on Arab Politics at The Washington Institute.

“The April 3 Oval Office meeting between Presidents Trump and Abdul Fattah al-Sisi promises to be a warm homecoming. Although the two leaders have met only once previously – prior to the U.S. elections on the sidelines of last year’s UN General Assembly – they have by all accounts established a good rapport,” he wrote recently.

Schenker said their bond appears to be based on counterterrorism. Egypt is facing an insurgency from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in the Sinai Peninsula that is claiming dozens of Egyptian security force deaths per month on average.

ISIS, though having an estimated 600 fighters in the area, has wreaked havoc in the Sinai. According to Schenker, its successes there include the downing of an Mi-17 helicopter in 2014, destroying an M60 battle tank and sinking an Egyptian patrol boat in 2015. It has claimed it bombed a Russian passenger jet, killing 224 civilians.

A big question for Trump is how much he may provide to Egypt in terms of financial support to tackle this problem as well as terrorism in the region, amid concerns of human rights abuses.

The U.S. currently provides $1.3 billion in annual foreign military financing, and al-Sisi could request additional military funding that will enable it to purchase legacy weapons systems using U.S. financial assistance commitments.

The Obama administration curtailed some aid to the country in 2015 after al-Sisi’s military coup against Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi.

Trump has indicated he has wanted to cut foreign assistance, but the senior official said a “strong and sufficient level of support” to Egypt will continue.

“We’ve had a longstanding relationship with substantial foreign military assistance and economic support. That support has continued and we anticipate it will continue into the future,” the official said.

“We’re in the budget process right now, and those discussions are ongoing as to how it will be broken out but we are going to maintain a strong and sufficient level of support to Egypt,” the official said.

There is some concern that Egypt has not been cracking down as hard as it could on ISIS, and is instead more concerned with buying weapons for a future conventional war.

“To wit, the Egyptian military continues to favor purchasing tanks, F-16s, and missiles with its FMF instead of equipment better suited for counterinsurgency and border-security operations,” Schenker wrote.

As for human rights issues, the official said they are always “first and foremost in our discussions,” but said the administration’s approach is to handle such sensitive issues discreetly.

“Our approach is to handle these types of sensitive issues in a private, more discreet way that we believe is the most effective way to advance those issues to a favorable outcome,” the official said.

Trump is also expected to press al-Sisi to advance political and economic reform in Egypt, the senior administration official said.

“[Al-Sisi has] called for reform and moderation of Islamic discourse, initiated historic and courageous economic reforms, and sought to reestablish Egypt’s regional leadership role,” the official said.

“President Trump also supports al-Sisi’s ambition to develop a comprehensive counterterrorism approach that involves military, political, economic as well as social efforts. But President Trump also wants to increase the focus on economic and commercial cooperation,” the official said.

“Building a more stable, productive economy is a critical step to ensure long-term stability in Egypt,” the official said. “There is no question that the transition in their economy will be difficult in the long run, Egypt will be stronger if it follows through on its homegrown reform plan.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3477ca94:2424df6:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” House Freedom Caucus Member Sen. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) urged President Donald Trump to work with the freedom caucus instead of establishment Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.

Gohmert explained how Trump and the Freedom Caucus came to agreement on two separate occasions during the Obamacare replacement negotiations, but establishment Republicans rejected them.

“The president’s administration will either succeed or fail over the next 30 days,” Gohmert stated. “He can work with people that got him there that defended him when others like Ryan and the establishment were running scared, or he can work with us to help him fulfill his promises.”

President Donald Trump approved a declaration of a “major disaster” in California over the weekend, freeing up federal funds for flood relief in several rural counties in response to requests from Governor Jerry Brown and local residents.

In a press release on Sunday, the White House stated:

Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump declared a major disaster exists in the State of California and ordered Federal assistance to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides during the period of February 1 to February 23, 2017. … Federal funding is available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides in the counties of Alameda, Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, Contra Costa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Glenn, Humboldt, Kings, Lake, Lassen, Marin, Mariposa, Merced, Modoc, Monterey, Napa, Nevada, Plumas, Sacramento, San Benito, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Tuolumne, Yolo, and Yuba. Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.

The Los Angeles Times notes that President Trump’s declaration extends federal relief first offered in January.

Despite California Democrats’ determination to “resist” President Trump’s broader agenda, the president has granted the state’s requests for emergency relief.

However, the administration has also warned “sanctuary cities” in California that they will lose millions of dollars in federal grant money for law enforcement if they continue to refuse to cooperate with or honor federal immigration law.

CAIRO (Reuters) – Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi left Cairo for Washington on Saturday where both sides will seek a renewed relationship after tensions over Sisi’s crackdown on opponents.

As well as meeting President Donald Trump, Sisi will see the top officials at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, where he will pitch for help with his country’s’ ailing economy.

The trip will be Sisi’s first U.S. state visit since being elected president in 2014 as former U.S. President Barack Obama had never extended an invitation. Sisi was elected a year after leading the military’s ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood’s president Mohamed Mursi after mass protests.

Talk show host Chelsea Handler called President Donald Trump a “f*cking loser” at a benefit for the Los Angeles Public Library Saturday night, as she joked that Trump’s bestselling book The Art of the Deal had made a significant “impact” on her life.

“I think the way we have come together is so inspiring,” the 42-year-old Chelsea host said at the Young Literati Toast in Los Angeles, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

“I would have hoped that would have happened before the election, but I’ll f*cking take it because it’s so much better to be friends with people you would never talk to before just because we all know that Donald Trump is a f*cking loser,” she added.

The Saturday night event, held by the Library Foundation of Los Angeles to benefit the L.A. Public Library, saw a number of celebrities — including Silicon Valley star Kumail Nanjiani, Veep‘s Timothy Simons and Fresh Off the Boat actress Constance Wu — read excerpts from books that have inspired them.

“I was browsing through the books in the library and came across a book that would change the course of my life forever,” Handler reportedly said about The Art of the Deal, Trump’s 1987 bestseller. “The story of this man’s struggles, successes and setbacks were exactly what I needed because of the impact it has made in my life.”

According to THR, the money raised at Saturday’s event will go to pay for the establishment of so-called Student Zones at the library, where children can have access to computers, school supplies, and tutoring.

Handler has been a fierce critic of the president, and has extended her criticism to members of Trump’s family.

At the Sundance Film Festival in January — where the talk show host led a Women’s March protest against Trump — Handler said she would never interview First Lady Melania Trump because she can “barely speak English.” The First Lady reportedly speaks five languages.

In March, Handler attacked Trump’s unborn grandchild in a tweet but misspelled the word “genes,” leading Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to respond to her with the correct spelling.

Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “MediaBuzz,” Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the media are focusing on stories that aren’t real instead of President Donald Trump’s accomplishments.

Huckabee Sanders said, “The media constantly wants to talk about something that doesn’t exist instead of something that does. We’ve spent the last couple of months doing major policy initiatives and rollouts in the forms of executive orders, rolling back regulations, creating an environment where businesses are confident in hiring again. We have heard from CEO after CEO, small business owners that they are excited about this president they are excited about the economy. And yet, the media refuses to cover that. They’re more than happy to talk about a story, frankly, that is just fake and it’s time to move on.”

President Donald Trump defiantly took to Twitter Sunday, decrying widespread media speculation that he was backing away from his campaign pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare after the failure of Ryancare.

Anybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal &amp; Replace of ObamaCare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2017

The president and his aides had been steadfast in his efforts to get a healthcare bill through Congress despite the unpopularity and flaws of the “American Health Care Act,” spearheaded by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) before it was forced to be withdrawn for lack of support among various elements of the House Republican Caucus on March 24.

In criticizing the House Freedom Caucus in a tweet this past Thursday, Trump appeared to be referring to the Caucus’s instrumentality in preventing the House Republican Majority from settling for the unpopular Ryancare. “The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, &amp; fast,” the president tweeted.

Sunday’s tweets, however, indicate confidence on Trump’s part that his party can still be unified behind a plan to repeal and replace former President Obama’s still unpopular Affordable Healthcare Act. The president appeared determined that a plan amenable to the desperate current of opinions that have emerged within the Republican Party over health care.

Talks on Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2017

The tweets were backed up by a report in the Wall Street Journal that, in the hours following the tweets, President Trump met with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), along with his Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, at his Trump National Golf Club in northern Virginia. Senator Paul had been among the fiercest critics of Speaker Ryan’s bill as it made its way through the lower chamber. “They’re discussing a variety of topics, including health care,” White House deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the Journal.

While some in the GOP have expressed their desire to move on to other legislative priorities, the president’s latest comments on social media stand counter to mainstream media suggestions that health care reform, and by extension Trump’s ability to govern, is dead in the aftermath of Ryancare’s failure.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b313d251b:1f282a6:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Appearing on this week’s Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson, a former head of internal affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) discusses whether the agency can properly vet 15,000 new Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and officers.

James Tomscheck served as head of CBP internal affairs for eight years during the Bush and Obama Administrations. During that timeframe, he faced the challenge of hiring and properly screening 10,000 people between 2006 and 2008. Following that surge a government watchdog report detailed a dramatic increase in corruption cases involving Border Patrol and ICE agents, Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly reported in February 2013. The report led to CBP adding polygraph examinations to its hiring and screening process.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly ordered the hiring of 5,000 Border Patrol agents, 500 CBP Air and Marine Operations officers, and 10,000 ICE agents and officers in a February memo tasking the implementation of President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration enforcement.

Tomscheck’s interview with Sharyl Attkisson begins at the 10-minute mark in this video.

“I very much hope that those going forward with the initiative look at what we’ve learned when we executed the border patrols search of 2006-2008,” Tomscheck told Attkisson Sunday morning. His department faced the challenges of screening 10,000 new hires during that period.

Attkisson asked the former head of internal affairs about drug dealers and cartel members being hired inadvertently during the surge. “We certainly believe that to be the case,” Tomscheck replied. “We do know that in the thousands of polygraph exams that we administered after the background investigation, more than half of those persons that cleared that background investigation failed the polygraph exam and provided detailed admissions as to why it was they failed the exam; included in that study group of more than 1,000 were persons who admitted that they were infiltrators, that they worked for a drug trafficking organization, either on the US side of the border or the Mexican side of the border, who had been directed to infiltrate CBP and compromise what they do there.”

Attkisson noted that through Tomscheck’s insistence, polygraph screening became a standard in the hiring process. “What we found in those first 100+ exams was genuinely shocking,” he explained. “We found persons failing the polygraph at a higher rate than other agencies, but not dramatically so. What was dramatically different was the nature of the admissions obtained from those persons who had failed. They had included many persons who were actively involved in smuggling, persons who very frequently used drugs were currently using controlled substances and included persons involved in significant serious felony crimes.”

Attkisson reports frequently on border-related issues including corruption within the agencies. In June 2016, Breitbart Texas Editor-in-Chief Brandon Darby and Ortiz reported on an interview with Attkisson on Breitbart News Daily (Sirius XM Patriot 125) with Stephen K. Bannon.

Sharyl Attkisson made the shocking assertion that Mexican cartels have infiltrated the U.S. military and U.S. law enforcement agencies–and she is correct. Her assertion is backed up by years of Breitbart Texas reports showing that some U.S. soldiers have worked for cartel efforts to smuggle humans and drugs and that far too many in U.S. federal law enforcement agencies have fallen into working for Mexican cartels.

During the interview with Bannon, Attkisson discussed corruption by drug cartels of members of both the military and Border Patrol:

On the other hand, I think about the military guys, and they may think, is this a victimless crime? It’s really not illegal to come to this country. The two Mexicans they had been transporting last week had each been removed from the US three times before. And maybe they think, why shouldn’t I make some money on the side doing something the government doesn’t really mind. They don’t mind if the illegal immigrants come here. I think they know about it. And it’s people inside Border Patrol and inside the military who have long been involved in smuggling drugs, as well as smuggling humans. They’re well aware of it. They don’t talk about it much but it’s well known inside. I’ll be doing a story in the Fall about corruption inside the Border Patrol which is just out of control. There’s so many agents. The cartels place people inside Border Patrol now, smugglers place people inside Border Patrol get them hired there. It’s a big issue.

Corruption of CBP law enforcement agents and officers by drug cartel members continues to plague the agency. In November 2016, Homeland Security Investigations agents arrested a Border Patrol supervisor, Eduardo Bazan, on charges of accepting bribes and participating in fake drug seizures, Breitbart Texas’ Ildefonso Ortiz reported.

As part of their investigation into Bazan, HSI used informants and defendants to identify one of the fake seizures that had been carried with the alleged help of Bazan, court documents revealed. Following that new information, HSI agents interviewed Bazan on October 31, about the seizure. During that interview, Bazan denied any involvement in the scheme. Agents the tracked down an incident report that they used to determine Bazan’s role in the case. During a second interview on November 1, Bazan told agents that he had played a role in the fake seizure and had been paid for it, court records revealed.

In November 2015, Ortiz reported on the arrest of Border Patrol Agent Joel Juna for his alleged role in a cartel beheading in South Texas. Despite the capital murder conviction of his brother, Gulf Cartel Commander Eduardo “Comandante Pajarito” Luna, a jury failed to find enough evidence to convict the Border Patrol agent and found him not guilty. “At the time of Joel Luna’s arrest, authorities discovered inside a safe a badge, a duty-issued rifle, a jeweled handgun with the words Cartel Del Golfo and Pajarito inscribed on them, $90,000 and various drugs,” Ortiz wrote. The jury found this evidence to be enough to convict him on two counts of engaging in organized crime.

Federal authorities arrested a CBP officer in Brownsville, Texas, for his role helping drug cartels smuggle drugs through ports of entry. The jury found Jose Luis Zavala guilty and Judge Andrew Hanen sentenced him to six-and-one- half years in prison.

In September 2016, Breitbart California’s Michelle Moons reported on the arrest of CBP Officer Jose Luis Cota for his alleged role in receiving sex and cash for smuggling drugs across the border.

With that said, Tomscheck said the move to hire more agents and officers is a positive step. “I don’t think that there’s any question that there needs to be an increase in staffing to make the border more secure,” he told the Full Measure host. “Whatever type of physical barrier you place at the border, there needs to be a physical presence of persons to apprehend those persons that scale the fence or the wall; whatever barrier separates the two countries. That can only be accomplished with a sufficient number of agents and officers positioned at the border to make those apprehensions.”

His advice to the Trump Administration, “Move very cautiously. If there is a reduction in the security protocols to screen and vet applicants, I believe we will give compromise to the agencies future.”

I just watched Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, get eaten alive by Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace.

Not only was it an ugly and painful sight but it was also a very dispiriting one.

Here is the guy who was carefully selected to be in the vanguard of President Trump’s war on the Green Blob which, for decades, has been doing untold damage to liberty, the scientific method, and the economy.

And he can’t even answer a few basic and obvious questions about why the job he is doing is necessary, important, and right.

Wallace asked him about the UN’s view that it was 95 percent likely that more than half the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activity.

Pruitt sweated, stuttered, and floundered.

Wallace asked him about NOAA’s claim that 2015 and 2016 are the hottest years on record.

Pruitt had no convincing comeback.

Wallace asked him the age-old question beloved by climate alarmists: “What if you’re wrong? What if CO2 is causing dramatic climate change and we as humans are responsible?”

Pruitt just didn’t know how to respond.

There should have been nothing complicated or unexpected about these questions. They are the kind of thing any half-way decent interviewer might have asked, be he a hostile one or a semi-friendly Fox News one playing devil’s advocate.

And if Scott Pruitt had had even the most cursory briefing and media training in his new role, he should have been prepared for them.

Not only should he have known the most effective answers to give; but he should have been so confident in the rightness and truth of his cause that he should have been able to seize the moment and make the points that really need to be made about President Trump’s environmental policy: that it is being enacted for the good of science, for the good of the economy and the core mission of Making America Great Again.

How could Scott Pruitt not do this?

Any one of us on the skeptical side of the argument could have pointed him to dozens of leading scientists — and hundreds if not thousands of papers and articles — that could easily have enabled Pruitt to say what needed to be said.

He could have noted the incompetence, corruption, and mendacity of the heavily politicized IPCC; the dishonest manipulation by organizations like NOAA — indeed especially NOAA — of the raw temperature data; the utter meaninglessness of the “hottest year evah” claims so often made in the liberal media.

And he could easily have batted off the “What if you’re wrong?” question by making perhaps the most important point of all that needs to be made about the “war” on “carbon”: that what it all comes down to is cost benefit analysis. To whit: the trillions of dollars being spent every year on the possibility that there might be a problem, a) could be spent much more usefully elsewhere and b) are doing more harm than good.

Pruitt was incapable of doing this though because, trained lawyer though he is, he is simply not on top of his brief.

This is disgraceful. It’s an embarrassment and a shambles. Worst of all, it’s an entirely needless concession to the enemy.

See how it’s being reported by the Soros-funded propaganda site Think Progress.

Even Fox News can’t believe that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, doesn’t accept the basic scientific finding that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to recent global warming. Pruitt may have thought the Murdoch-owned network that has led the way on attacking climate science for two decades would be a friendly audience. He was wrong. Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace thoroughly debunked Pruitt for defending his absurd claim that CO2 is not “a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.”

And on this occasion, the Soros attack dogs are quite right to be yelping so excitedly.

I’ve reported before on the worrying signs that Scott Pruitt may not be up to the job of EPA Administrator.

His performance on Fox seems only to confirm it.

If the Trump administration is serious about dealing with the vast and out-of-control Climate Industrial Complex which has done so much harm to the U.S. and the world these past few decades, then it is going to need to seriously up its game.

It’s not enough to talk the talk. Not when there are so many individuals and institutions — 99.99 percent of the EPA, for one — which are determined to sabotage every one of the President’s good intentions.

Unless the Trump administration can frame the war on the Green Blob as something more than merely a sensible cost-cutting exercise or — as Pruitt is determined to think of it — a reassertion of states’ rights, it is almost certainly doomed to lose it.

There is so much corruption, dishonesty, rent-seeking, bad science and malfeasance on the greenie side of the argument that, really, it represents a barn-door-sized target.

To miss at this point wouldn’t merely be stupid. It would be totally unforgivable.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b31218386:1f12cc3:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The White House will light up in the color blue Sunday evening in honor of World Autism Awareness Day.

“I invite all Americans to Light it Up Blue, which Melania and I will do at the White House,” President Trump said in an announcement Friday, according to The Hill.

“I call upon all Americans to learn more about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by those with autism spectrum disorders, and to do what they can to support individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families,” he added.

Press Secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump promised “the late wife of his friend Bob Wright that he would illuminate the White House in blue if he won the election,” according to the Associated Press.

Bob Wright and his wife Suzanne, who passed away in 2016, founded the Autism Speaks advocacy group in 2005, which has a blue logo.

“Spicer says it’s in honor of the Wrights that the White House on Sunday will help draw attention to a ‘great cause,&apos;” AP reports.

“On World Autism Awareness Day, we highlight the importance of addressing the causes and improving the treatments for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),” Trump said.

“We also recognize the importance of identifying ASDs early in a child’s life and of understanding the obstacles faced by people living on the autism spectrum.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b31218386:1f12cc0:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump golfed with Sen. Rand Paul this afternoon, together with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.

“We had a great day with the president. Played some golf, and we talked and we talked about a little bit of health care,” Paul told reporters after the game. “I continue to be very optimistic that we are getting closer and closer to an agreement on repealing Obamacare.”

The group golfed at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virgina, not far from Washington, D.C.

Paul remains one of the toughest opponents of the House drafted bill to replace Obamacare, asserting that it doesn’t sufficiently repeal the bill. Earlier in the week, Paul met with journalist Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report to discuss the future of the country.

“Intriguing lunch in hill office of America’s best senator, Rand Paul,” Drudge wrote afterwards on Twitter. “He’s bold, brave and has somehow kept his heart in such a corrupt city.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b3105f8c6:1c87130:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Sunday on MSNBC’s “PoliticsNation,” Newark, NJ Mayor Ras Baraka (D) said President Donald Trump’s administration’s threat to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities was ” trying to intimidate” them into becoming “fugitive slave catchers.”

Baraka said, “I think that them targeting sanctuary cities is a way for them to tell mayors and other folks around the country: one, that they’re sticking to what, I think, is a very unconstitutional and un-American policy. And trying to intimidate us into being what I’ve called ‘fugitive slave catchers’ that run around and do their bidding in our cities. And if we refuse to do that, then it makes it difficult for them to continue their policy because they don’t have the resources to kind of run down all the undocumented residents locally.”

Partial transcript as follows:

HALEY: No one is talking to me about the president’s tweets. No one is talking about any of those issues.

DICKERSON: So should foreign leaders, the president tweets something, they should ignore it?

HALEY: I think the foreign leaders are picking up the phone and calling him if they have an issue. That’s what they’re doing with me. They are calling me, not texting me saying, what was this tweet about.

DICKERSON: In diplomacy, words often get tangled and mixed and people obsess about the importance of words. So say going into the president’s meeting with the president of China, he has in the past said, “we can’t continue to allow China to rape our country.” Those are pretty strong words. How is a foreign leader coming to a visit supposed to weigh those words in advance of their meeting?

HALEY: You have face-to-face meetings. This is all about relationships and trying to find some level of trust. When it comes to the issue of North Korea, it’s something we’re very concerned about. China is very aware of that. I think you saw Secretary Tillerson go to Beijing. I have talked with my Chinese counterpart and told them we need to see actions on the side of China. I think the president and also the Chinese president will talk about what those actions will be so we are working together and not watching North Korea do their own thing and China support it. These face-to-face meetings are extremely important. These conversations are extremely important. That’s when you get all the chatter out of the way and when you focus on getting things done.

DICKERSON: The president’s tweets are basically chatter?

HALEY: I don’t know, you’d have to ask everybody else. I don’t hear about them. I don’t talk about them. I don’t have them interfere in everything I’m doing. So to me it’s chatter. I don’t focus on.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2f688b6d:1ab31e1:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks argued President Trump’s tweets against the House Freedom Caucus were “amateur hour, another kindergarten mistake. First of all, he’s not going to do it. He’s not going to run people against somebody in two years. Second, if he did, it would be highly unlikely to be successful.”

Brooks stated, “The decision to send these tweets and to threaten people like [Representative] Mark Sanford (R-SC) and other members of the Freedom Caucus was amateur hour, another kindergarten mistake. First of all, he’s not going to do it. He’s not going to run people against somebody in two years. Second, if he did, it would be highly unlikely to be successful. Even Franklin Roosevelt, at the head of his popularity, he once tried to run against a local person, and lost, all the way, across the board, because people like their — they like their local member. And then, meanwhile, he — the Freedom Caucus guys are loving this today. They are the little guy standing up to — the little guy representing their district. And then their manhood has been called into question. So, they can’t back down now. So, I found it completely counterproductive.”

He later added, “[House Speaker Representative] Paul Ryan (R-WI), I respect a lot of his policies, but I do think he’s a bit locked in the 1980s intellectually. But the problem, the core problem here is still with Donald Trump. He doesn’t have a theory of what Trumpism is. And he does not have a strategy for converting his populist campaigning into some sort of legislative agenda.”

During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump stated that Judge Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination “is about more than his incredible qualifications. It’s about preserving our Republic.”

Transcript as Follows:

“My fellow Americans, it’s an exciting time for our country. Our new Administration has so much change underway — change that is going to strengthen our Union and improve so many people’s lives.

In the next few days, the Senate will be taking a very important step — one that will protect the rule of law and democratic way of life that is absolutely a birthright of all Americans.

And it involves one of my most important actions as President. That was nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia.

Judge Gorsuch is incredibly qualified. He has a sterling record. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals.

But Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is about more than his incredible qualifications.

It’s about preserving our Republic.

In their great wisdom, the Founders placed legislative power in its own separate branch of government. Elected representatives from all across the country come together. They host hearings, they listen to the concerns of the people, and then, they try to write laws that address those concerns and make life better for all Americans. It’s a process that is meant to take time and energy to ensure that every new law will better serve our wonderful citizens. That’s how our democratic process works.

The duty of judges, therefore, is not to re-write the laws — but to uphold the laws, and to apply the Constitution as written.

That is the solemn duty of every Justice on the Supreme Court — and this is what Judge Gorsuch will do.

In recent years, we’ve seen more and more judges make decisions not based on the Constitution or the rule of law, but based on their preferences, their personal views, or even their political opinions.

Each time a judge substitutes their own opinions for an unbiased reading of the law, they damage our democracy. They put their own will above the will of the people. And they undermine the legislative process that has always been the heartbeat of our democracy.

The Senate will soon have the chance to help preserve our democratic institutions for our children — by voting to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

Judge Gorsuch is going to serve our people by devoting himself to our beloved Constitution. The Senate saw this firsthand in hours of Judge Gorsuch’s impressive testimony. In every step of the process, what has been clear to all is that Judge Gorsuch is a man who respects the law. He defends the Constitution. And in doing so, he will protect our freedoms.

With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, America will be a more free, fair, and just Nation for all of our citizens.

Thank you, and God bless you.”

It was no secret during the campaign that Donald Trump was a narcissist and a demagogue who used fear and dishonesty to appeal to the worst in American voters. The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a “catastrophe.”

Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck.

…

In a matter of weeks, President Trump has taken dozens of real-life steps that, if they are not reversed, will rip families apart, foul rivers and pollute the air, intensify the calamitous effects of climate change and profoundly weaken the system of American public education for all.

…

What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation — these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his scorched-earth outsider campaign; indeed, some of them helped get him elected. But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2f3186f5:1a74c3a:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” House Intelligence Committee ranking Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said it is “way premature” to conclude that members of President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

“I don’t think we can say anything definitively at this point,” Schiff said. “We are still at the very early stages of the investigation. The only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for us not to get to the bottom of this. We really need to find out exactly what the Russians did. Because one of the most important conclusions that the intelligence community reached is that they are going to do this again to the United States. They are doing it already in Europe. So we can say conclusively this is something that needs to be thoroughly investigated but it’s way premature to be reaching conclusions.”

Sunday on “The Cats Roundtable” on New York AM 970 radio, former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-FL) told host host John Catsimatidis “leadership” from President Donald Trump would be “helpful” to get Republicans to unite behind a common agenda.

Bush said, “We haven’t come up with a compelling, unifying agenda that can replace that. And that’s where you see the struggles in Washington right now. The healthcare debacle is a good example of that. And presidential leadership would be helpful here. There’s a lot that could be done that I think has broad-based support.”

He added, “If he could focus on these positive things, our brand then could be solidified, I think. Being against what the other guys are for is not a sustainable political position ”

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union on Sunday morning that he “can’t say whether anything was masked or unmasked properly” after visiting the White House on Friday to see the same the surveillance documents that committee chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) saw last month.

It was an unusually muted response from Schiff, and suggests that the documents substantiate Nunes’ claims that the Obama administration conducted surveillance on members of the Trump transition team, and unmasked the names of U.S. citizens improperly before the intelligence was disseminated throughout the government. He merely said that he did not “agree with the chairman’s characterization” of the documents, but did not elaborate or say Nunes was wrong.

Schiff also added that he remained upset that the documents had not been shared with him before Nunes shared them with the White House, and he raised suspicions about the way in which the White House had obtained the information.

In addition, Schiff backed off claims he made last month on MSNBC that there was “more than circumstantial” evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. When Tapper asked him point-blank whether there was “collusion,” Schiff said: “I don’t think we can say anything definitively at this point.”

Schiff’s failure to contest Nunes’s claims directly, and his refusal to repeat his conclusions about Russian collusion, add subtle support to two arguments: first, the contention by two senior former Obama administration intelligence officials that there is no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia; and second, the contention by President Donald Trump that he and his team were the victims of improper surveillance and leaks by the outgoing Obama administration.

MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts cautioned Democrats Saturday, saying they are in a “fever dream” and letting themselves “get the cart before the horse” over the report that President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor retired Gen. Mike Flynn asked for immunity in exchange for his testimony in the investigation into Russian ties to the president.

“It is wild speculation,” Roberts warned of asking for immunity meaning certain guilt. “I think that there are many Democrats who are watching this who might be in a fever dream over what is taking place here because they are letting themselves kind of get the cart before the horse on this.”

“I have a prediction to make,” Pirro said in her opening statement. “While the left acts like children who just can’t get over the fact that Hillary lost the election and simply won’t stop their abusive invectives against the man who was constitutionally elected, calling him ‘not legitimate,’ and his cabinet ‘scum bags,’ that man is doing the job we hired him to do.”

She continued, “He is building up and modernizing the military, as well as strengthening law enforcement.”

“[W]e have a crazy system here where we have a president who is tweeting things on the basis of very little knowledge, but that isn’t a problem for him,” Pelosi told host Joy Reid. “So, really I think that there should be some adults in the Republican Party who would say, ‘Please, you bring dishonor to the office of the president by making it look like it’s a personal acquisition of yours.’ No, it is a public responsibility.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio should be forced to share his mayoral home with MS-13 gang members instead of being allowed to impose a “sanctuary city” policy which releases gang members into New York neighborhoods, says i ndependent mayoral candidate Bo Dietl.

“How dare this mayor says ‘We won’t allow ICE or the FBI to do their job,&apos;” Dietl said, shortly after de Blasio upped his opposition to the enforcement of federal immigration laws. “If ‘Big Bird de Blasio’ wants them [ilegals] in New York, I will tell you what I would do, send the MS-13 gang over to Gracie Mansion.”

He continued:

de Blasio has no idea what he is doing regarding this issue … We should not allow felons and criminal illegal gang members like MS-13 to be in this country. When they go to Rikers Island [jail], these criminals should be turned over to ICE.

Public concern about MS-13 has risen amid a crime wave by illegal alien MS-13 members in New York’s Long Island.

Dietl’s stinging criticism of de Blasio was accompanied by a promise to work with other politicians if he gets elected as mayor in November.

“I really believe that I can work really well with the governor and stop the antagonistic attitude of this mayor to the governor and to the president,” Dietl said Thursday morning in a Press Conference outside Governor Cuomo’s New York office. “We got to realize one thing — whether you like Donald Trump or not, he’s our president for the next four years. There is a word called ‘compromise’ and [de Blasio] needs to compromise with the President and the governor of this great state.”

Dietl stated as mayor, he would go to Washington to sit down with President Trump and work with the fellow New Yorker on issues such as immigration enforcement and obtaining federal funding for affordable housing and infrastructure.

“I’ll say to him, ‘Mr. President, you love this city. The Brooklyn Bridge is falling and what we need is federal funding from Washington.’” Dietl said. “Wouldn’t it be good to get as much money as we can out of him instead of being antagonistic with him?”

The press conference began with Dietl continuing his push to ask the Governor to open an independent investigation regarding the mayor’s campaign finance violations, despite de Blasio has been cleared by both New York’s federal U.S. Attorney and the Manhattan District Attorney’s office.

“This is not over. Just because they didn’t have enough to indict him on criminal charges, there is enough evidence to take de Blasio down on civil charges and make him return that money he raised and fine him,” Dietl said, while reading a two-page letter he sent to the Governor.

“I want the Governor, who is against corruption to not let de Blasio get away with it. New York City is not a pay-to-pay city. Let keep it clean from corruption,” Dietl said.

“New York City needs a mayor for all the people, not just people that will give him money like the big union backers,” Dietl said. “New York will not stand for a mayor as corrupt as him. He talks about the tale of two cities, well he is on the tale of the rich side.”

He added, “Why are we re-electing him. Once he gets re-elected, de Blasio is going to become more lazy, he won’t even show up to work. What has this mayor done the past three and a half years to give him the credit to now be re-elected.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2c2e130d:1943fa7:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee told a Thursday forum at the Washington-based watchdog Judicial Watch that starting April 1 his committee and staff will hold President Donald Trump and his administration accountable for producing requested documents.

“I would hope the new president would get more aggressive and demand that these departments and agencies provide the documents that Congress is seeking,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), who took over the committee at the start of the previous session of Congress. “I don’t think they are off to a good start.”

Up until the end of March, the chairman said he indulged the Trump administration’s need to settle in, he said.

The chairman was careful to note that regarding new requests the committee sent to the administration, the response has been prompt and cooperative, such as with inquiries into the Government Services Administration lease of the Old Post Office building to the Trump Organization, now operating the Trump International Hotel there. “That was disposed of right on time.”

Chaffetz said that all requests to the President Barack Obama administration are still active, and before the inauguration, he sent a letter to then-incoming White House Counsel Donald McGahn informing him that he expected the Trump administration to have a better record complying with congressional requests than Obama’s. “We expect these to be fulfilled.”

The problem is that many of the same people who obstructed congressional inquiries before Jan. 20 are still in place after Jan. 20, he said. “The non-political appointees, who were giving us the stiff arm in the past and they’re giving us the stiff arm now.”

There is now a culture of non-disclosure and uncooperativeness inside the executive branch that has to change, he said.

“It is just stunning the creativity and reluctance to provide a basic document, and I have not seen anything change in the first 70-odd days,” he said.

“We are still in court over Fast and Furious,” he said. “Fast and Furious was this gun-running scheme, where the administration, knowingly and willingly, gave the drug cartels nearly 2,000 weapons. They did this on purpose. Really bad idea.”

Chaffetz went on to say:

Instead of showing us the documents and showing us the information and coming clean on what they admit was a really bad operation that led to the death of an untold number of people–you had the attorney general himself personally–I am foreshadowing here because we have not released this–almost on a daily basis, personally get involved in exactly what they were going to provide to Congress, not provide Congress, as he personally on a daily basis went out there to try to manipulate the truth.

That attorney general was Eric Holder.

Another example of one of the committee’s open investigations is the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on American personnel and facilities in Benghazi, Libya, he said.

In that case, the Utah congressman said a Utah National Guardsman spoke to him privately about his tour of duty in Libya that ended shortly before the attacks.

Chaffetz said he arranged to meet the soldier in a Secured Compartmented Intelligence Facility, or SCIF, in Utah. After that conversation, the congressman went to Libya himself to check out the situation.

“It was not the safest decision I ever made,” he said. Security personnel would not allow him to sleep overnight at the American embassy in Tripoli.

“I got back, and I started to pepper the administration,” he said.

When Chaffetz returned, Obama administration officials repeatedly mislead him about facts on the ground there, seemingly unaware that the congressman had learned the facts on the ground there by being there himself.

“They were in total denial,” he said. “Almost every single fact that I learned there they denied.”

The frustrations dealing with the Obama White House were not just political, but also institutional, he said.

There is an inherent conflict of interest when the House of Representatives must rely on the executive, the Department of Justice, to enforce its subpoenas and prosecute individuals working in the executive branch.

Most times, requests to the executive are dead letters until Congress or a third-party, such Judicial Watch, convinces a judge to order the bureaucrats to comply, he said.

“It shouldn’t have to be that way,” he said.

A Friday breaking Fox News report on surveillance of President Trump’s team that began before he became the Republican presidential nominee claimed a very senior intelligence official was responsible—as well as for the unmasking of the names of private U.S. citizens.

The report cited sources which also indicated that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) knew of the existence of the information in January, but one or more intelligence agencies blocked him, and there were only two locations where he could view the information that he called “very troubling.”

On Thursday, the New York Times began reporting what they claimed were the identities of two White House officials who were the sources of the information disclosed to Nunes.

Nunes met with sources on White House grounds on the day before he announced to reporters striking news that he had seen new and disturbing information indicating intelligence officials under the Obama administration “unmasked” the names of Trump team members who were incidentally surveilled.

On Saturday President Donald Trump tweeted:

Wow, @FoxNews just reporting big news. Source: &quot;Official behind unmasking is high up. Known Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017

..not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated.&quot; If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017

The Friday Fox News report cited “a number of sources” with claims that not only were the two White House officials not the sources of the information shared with Nunes, but that Nunes knew of the information in January, and that the agencies where the information came from had blocked Nunes from gaining access to it. Further, the report cited officials within the agencies who said they were frustrated with the spreading of names for political purposes.

“Our sources, who have direct knowledge of what took place, were upset because those two individuals, they say, had nothing to do with the outing of this information,” Fox reported.

“We’ve learned that the surveillance that led to the unmasking of what started way before President Trump was even the GOP nominee,” reported Adam Housley. “The person who did the unmasking, I’m told, is very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world and is not in the FBI.”

“This led to other surveillance which led to multiple names being unmasked. Again these are private citizens in the United States,” said Housley. “This had nothing to do with Russia, I’m told, or foreign intelligence of any kind.”

The two named in Thursday’s reports as the sources of the information in those stories were not Nunes sources. “It was a navigation situation and the reason why they had to navigate, I’m told, is that Nunes learned about this unmasking and who this was, taking place back in January.”

“It took, obviously, a number of weeks to try to figure out a way for him to see this intelligence, because the agencies were stonewalling, we’re told, to allow him and others to see it,” said Housley. “This is all coming from folks that are in these agencies and frustrated with the politics that is taking place in these agencies.”

“We’re told that the main issue here is not only the unmasking of the names, but the spreading of names for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security and everything to do with hurting and embarrassing Trump and his team,” reported Housley.

“Fox also learned that an individual with direct knowledge that after Nunes had been approached by his source, the agencies basically would not allow him in at all,” said Housley.

Nunes and the White House have faced heated questions from the press about Nunes’s viewing of the information on White House grounds; however, the Fox report added that there were only two places where Nunes could have viewed the information. One was at the agencies where the information came from, which the reporting notes would have put the source at risk, and the other location was on the 18-acre White House grounds. Housley noted that the Old Executive Office Building is on White House grounds. He also specified where information after hours and where highly sensitive information may be accessed.

During Saturday’s “AM Joy” on MSNBC, House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) argued that the GOP has an “anti-woman” and anti-LGBT agenda.

“[The Republican] agenda is very similar to [President Donald Trump’s]. If you look at their budget over the last few years, if you look at their opposition to anything to do with the environment, to climate change, and the rest, if you look at their anti-woman agenda, LGBT agenda, you name it, they’ve been there sooner, longer and in some cases, worse,” Pelosi said to Joy Reid.

President Donald Trump plans to sign a bill to repeal Obama-era broadband privacy rules.

Republicans in Congress revoked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) privacy rule against strong opposition from Democrats who regard the rule as essential for consumer privacy. Conservatives call the law duplicitous and unnecessary. Republicans and telecom industry groups argue that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), not the FCC, traditionally protected consumer privacy.

The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the FCC under the Obama administration. The regulation required internet services providers (ISPs) to protect consumer data more stringently than content providers such as Google and Facebook. The FCC required internet providers to obtain consumer consent before using location data, financial information, health, information, and web history for advertising.

Breitbart News spoke with Phil Kerpen, president of American Commitment, about his organization’s opposition to the FCC’s broadband privacy rule. Kerpen told Breitbart News that the criticism against removing this regulation is unwarranted.

“This is a deliberate disinformation campaign from the usual suspects from the tech-left and the media, and they’re completely misrepresenting the issue, and the conservatives are falling for the fake news narrative,” he told Breitbart News. “Up until 2015, the FTC protected consumer privacy, and then the FCC Net Neutrality order eviscerated the consumer protections at the FTC by pre-empting FTC’s jurisdiction. The FCC then came around and hammered ISP’s with draconian regulations that do not apply to Google or Facebook.”

“This is especially concerning, considering they have considerably more access to your personal data than Comcast or Verizon,” Kerpen explained. “It’s insane that Google and Facebook have a near duopoly in the advertising game and they have less stringent rules in terms of what they can do with your private information.”

The president of the American Commitment said that Google is trying to rig the system against ISPs. “Google has this whole array of left-leaning groups defending their favorite regulations that put them in their favor,” he claimed. “If you recall Gigi Sohn, the counselor to former Chairman Tom Wheeler, resigned from the FCC and she’s now at the Open Society Institute, and she’s working with George Soros, and they’re pushing a lot of money to these narratives. There’s a reason that former Chairman Wheeler waited until the last possible minute to institute these regulations. They knew these were very easy headlines to write, such as ‘Republicans in Congress Undo Privacy Rules’ specifically to create this distortion campaign to make it harder to get rid of Net Neutrality.”

Kerpen added, “This whole fight against the ISPs is a sideshow, by far the biggest threat to consumer privacy is Google that has trackers on over 60 percent of all websites. Google owns YouTube, and they have trackers everywhere, and they’ve shifted the focus of the debate to issues that don’t regulate Google.”

Katie McAuliffe, executive director of Digital Liberty, told Breitbart News, “This is nothing more than another Obama-era regulation that needs to be removed.”

McAuliffe told Breitbart News that this broadband rule was another power grab by the Obama-era FCC. She said, “Obama’s FCC broadband rule was a power grab under the guise of privacy.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2b6d319e:188c1ce:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump proclaimed April as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, following in the footsteps of his presidential predecessor President Barack Obama.

“We recommit ourselves this month to establishing a culture of respect and appreciation for the dignity of every human being,” Trump said in a statement.

The proclamation noted that on average there are 300,000 instances of rape or other sexual assault crimes committed every year, and vowed that his administration would fight to protect people from sexual violence. He also committed to fighting child pornography. The statement also called for young people to hold their peers accountable and adults to teach men and boys to prevent violence.

“Our families, schools, and communities must encourage respect for women and children, who are the vast majority of victims, and promote healthy personal relationships,” the statement read.

On Wednesday, First Lady Melania Trump also gave a speech calling for “the international community to stand up against violence toward women and children and declared the need for promoting women’s empowerment” at the State Department’s International Women of Courage Award ceremony.

Trump’s committment to the issue of sexual assault drew predictable hatred from the left and Never Trumpers.

“I wonder if Trump would encourage this same support of the 16 women who have publicly accused him of sexual assault,” wrote Huffington Post editor Emma Gray on Twitter. Gray wrote an article at the Huffington Post headlined “Accused Sexual Predator Proclaims April National Sexual Assault Awareness Month” as she complained that Trump’s statement “removes almost all references to rape culture.”

“When I read Trump declared April, ‘National Sexual Assault Awareness Month’, I thought it was an April Fools joke,” CNN commentator Ana Navarro snarked on Twitter.

“Trump declared April National Sexual Assault Awareness month. In related news, Putin named April National Don’t-Stand-By-Open-Windows month,” wrote actor George Takei on Twitter.

“Irony just stabbed itself in the heart with a pair of dull scissors,” tweeted Kashana Cauley, a writer for The Daily Show.

“Grab Em By The Pussy Month will be in May,” wrote MSNBC anchor Christopher Hayes.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2b1abdc9:16548f6:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Actress Tina Fey hosted the American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) celebrity-studded “Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU” fundraising telethon Friday, where she ripped President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

In a searing three-minute comedy routine, Fey slammed President Trump’s proclamation Friday declaring April as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.

“Earlier tonight, in what is surely an April Fools’ joke, the president proclaimed that next month will be National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, so now we know what he gave up for Lent,” the former Saturday Night Live star said.

Riffing on reports that Vice President Pence declines to dine alone with women who are not his wife, Fey said, “Luckily, Mike Pence isn’t allowed to go down and shut Planned Parenthood unless his wife goes with him. So if we can just keep Karen busy scrapbooking, we can all still get Pap smears”:

The fundraising telethon, which streamed live on Facebook, also featured Tracy Morgan, Amy Poehler, Jon Hamm, Mahershala Ali, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Tituss Burgess.

At one point, “alternate universe current first daughter of the United States” Chelsea Clinton was introduced, and she addressed “voter suppression.”

“The right to vote is the bedrock of our democracy,” Clinton said. “It gives us, each and every citizen, a voice in how our government works. Sadly, this fundamental right is under attack all across the country. Dozens of states have passed laws in recent years making it harder to vote. These laws disproportionately affect minority groups, the poor, and the elderly. Millions have been disenfranchised by voter ID laws alone.”

Clinton also urged people to continue to resist Trump’s political agenda.

“I’m not giving up,” she said. “I hope that none of you are giving up because we know that our right to vote is fundamental, precious, and worth fighting for”:

In a video promoting the ACLU telethon, celebrities insisted that the nonprofit organization has “been preparing for this fight” against the Trump administration:

The ACLU has been leading the legal fight against President Trump’s immigration executive actions.

Former National Security Adviser and retired Lt. General Mike Flynn caused quite a stir by offering testimony to Congress and the FBI in exchange for immunity on Thursday.

Many jumped to conclusions, often the same reporters who insisted requests for immunity by members of Hillary Clinton’s inner circle were routine and entirely meaningless. Here are five things known with certainty about the Flynn case at this time:

Requests for immunity are not admissions of guilt. We should get that out of the way right up front since so many people who know better are getting it wrong. It is certainly fair to comment on immunity deals or talk about the impression they convey. The details of the immunity agreements for certain figures in the Clinton email scandal were downright bizarre, and arguably impeded the investigation, rather than enhancing it. Clinton partisans argued that other immunity grants were routine and implied absolutely nothing untoward.

One reason Flynn’s immunity offer brought such a wave of innuendo in response is that Flynn himself said last year, while discussing the Clinton email scandal, “When you are given immunity, that means you have probably committed a crime.” Bringing his own words back to haunt him is irresistible for his critics.

Furthermore, President Trump said essentially the same thing about immunity deals when talking about Clinton. Bringing his words back to haunt him is absolutely irresistible for the media.

But no, as Business Insider points out in one the above-linked posts about Flynn and Trump being haunted by their words, “a request for immunity does not amount to an admission of guilt,” and “a person granted immunity may still be criminally prosecuted for crimes revealed in the testimony as long as the activity is confirmed with independent evidence.” The difference here is that the media didn’t want to jump to conclusions about what any of those Clinton immunity deals meant.

Flynn’s attorney said he desires immunity to escape a “highly politicized witch hunt environment.” The statement issued by Flynn’s attorney Robert Kelner on Thursday explains why Flynn offered to testify in exchange for immunity. According to Kelner, Flynn “certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.”

After recounting the details of Flynn’s lengthy “life of national service,” Kelner states the media is “awash with unfounded allegations, outrageous claims of treason, and vicious innuendo directed against him.”

“He is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by Members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated,” Kelner points out. “No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.”

Flynn’s most serious legal jeopardy may involve contacts with Turkey, not Russia. Flynn’s offer involves testimony about contacts with Russia, and his tenure as National Security Adviser ended because of a conversation he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, but nothing illegal about that conversation has yet been demonstrated. The more serious problem for Flynn could be his connections with the government of Turkey.

Clinton-era CIA Director James Woolsey said last week that Flynn met with Turkish officials last summer to discuss Turkey’s long-desired extradition of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused of masterminding the July coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Woolsey claims he walked into the middle of a conversation between Flynn and Turkish officials in New York, in which the idea of staging a covert operation “in the dead of night to whisk this guy away” was discussed. Woolsey has variously described this conversation as either “startling and illegal,” or “naive” and without “credibility.”

Flynn has “registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before Election Day that may have aided the Turkish government,” according to Fox News. The White House has said President Trump was not aware Flynn was working for the Turks.

Fortune describes the precise allegations Flynn may end up facing over Turkey:

On March 7, after being fired as National Security Adviser, Flynn belatedly filed a FARA disclosure that revealed that, through his firm, Flynn Intel Group, he had worked in 2016 on behalf of Inovo BV, a firm based in Netherlands and owned by a Turkish businessman with links to the Turkish government. Flynn’s firm was paid $530,000 by Inovo. Flynn’s FARA filing (available here) revealed that the September 19 meeting occurred and that Gülen was discussed. But the filing claims that Flynn’s work was on behalf of Inovo, not the Turkish government, and that it concerned merely “the political climate in Turkey” and “doing business in Turkey,” related to the export of natural gas. But Woolsey’s statements to the Journal and CNN, and the FARA filing now suggest this was either false or a woefully incomplete account of the client and the purpose of Flynn’s work—that Flynn was actually advising the Turkish government about the extrajudicial removal of a green card holder from the United States. Turkey’s foreign minister and the son-in-law of Erdoğan, the country’s energy minister, were Flynn’s interlocutors that day about putting Gülen “out of action.”

FARA is the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and it would appear to be the clearest example of a law Flynn might be charged with violating. However, former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, now a writer for National Review, said on Thursday that Flynn was “unlikely to be prosecuted” for his late filing as a foreign agent.

A few Flynn-Russia contacts could still prove troublesome. Flynn’s communication with Ambassador Kislyak may have resulted in no legal charges – he was dismissed because his account of the conversations to the White House, particularly Vice President Mike Pence, was not completely accurate. Yet questions have still been raised about a $33,000 speaking engagement for the state-controlled Russia Today news agency and $23,000 of speeches he gave to Russian firms. Democrats have alleged these speeches may have violated the Emoluments Clause.

Flynn’s offer of testimony for immunity has not been accepted yet. The Senate Intelligence Committee reportedly told Flynn it was “not receptive” to his offer “at this time” on Friday.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said there are “many more witnesses and documents to obtain” before any immunity request from Flynn would be considered.

Schiff took the opportunity to pronounce it was a “grave and momentous step” for a former National Security Adviser to the President of the United States to ask for immunity from prosecution,” but he gave no sign of granting it.

A spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) said on Friday there has been a “preliminary conversation with Michael Flynn’s lawyer about arranging for Flynn to speak to the Committee,” but the discussion “did not include immunity or other possible conditions for his appearance.”

Schiff said the House Intelligence Committee would defer to the Justice Department, which at the time of this writing has given no indication it will offer Flynn immunity.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2a3e3d2f:15577c3:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Sex Pistol’s Johnny Rotten, real name John Lydon, complimented President Donald Trump in an interview with National Public Radio on Friday.

“When the conversation turns to President Trump, Lydon is provocative as ever,” the reporter said in introducing Lydon’s remarks.

“I think he’s absolutely magnificent,” Lydon said. “He’s a total cat amongst the pigeons.

“It’s got everybody now involving themselves in a political way,” Lydon said. “And I’ve been struggling for years to get people to wake up and do that.”

NPR spoke to Lydon, the singer with the iconic 1970s punk band, on the occasion of the release of “Mr. Rotten’s Songbook,” a compilation of lyrics of all the songs he penned.

Lydon also illustrated the 300-page book, according to NPR.

“I’ve got all these nice little anarchists running around with swords,” Lydon said, describing the drawings, “and the black and red anarchist flag. And of course, the Union Jack.”

Rotten became a U.S. citizen in 2013 and has previously praised Trump and criticized the “left-wing media” in this country.

“What I dislike is the left-wing media in America are trying to smear the bloke as a racist, and that’s completely not true,” Lydon said in an interview in London on Monday and reported by the Washington Times.

“There’s many, many problems with him as a human being, but he’s not that, and there just might be a chance something good will come out of that situation, because he terrifies politicians.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2a3e3d2f:15577c2:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump is expected to sign a pair of executive orders on Friday afternoon aimed at identifying and combatting abusive foreign trade practices.

The orders direct the government to launch a large-scale study of the massive and persistent U.S. trade deficit and instruct regulators to strictly enforce U.S. anti-dumping policies aimed at preventing foreign manufacturers from undercutting U.S. companies with unfairly low prices. They mark the latest step in the administration’s efforts to bolster U.S. manufacturing and prevent trading partners from taking advantage of the U.S.’s free trade stance.

The signing of the orders comes a day after an eruption of trade policy intrigue surrounding a leaked draft memo from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to members of Congress. The memo outlined proposed changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement that were far less sweeping than Trump’s statements on the campaign trail appeared to imply. Hours after the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News reported that the memo signaled a softening of the administration’s stance on NAFTA, White House press Secretary Sean Spicer said the memo did not reflect the administration’s views.

“That is not a statement of administration policy. It is not a statement of administration policy,” Spicer said.

The memo was leaked to journalists by members of the U.S. Senate, according to people familiar with the matter. Despite the statement from Spicer, the memo showed that some in the Trump administration are pushing to soften its stance on trade issues, these people said.

In a briefing with reporters on Thursday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that one of the orders instructs Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative to work together to conduct a sweeping review of the causes of U.S. trade deficits. While trade deficits with some countries–particularly those with oil exporting countries–are to be expected and not the result of abusive practices, persistent trade deficits in manufactured goods may be the result of unfair trade practices.

Examples of abusive trade practices include manufacturers selling goods below their cost of production and unfair subsidies aimed at undercutting U.S. manufacturers.

The report produced by the study will be the basis for the administration to implement policies cracking down on these abuses, according to Commerce Department officials.

The orders come a week before Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. While China is the largest source of the U.S.’s trade deficit, Ross and Peter Navarro, director of the National Trade Council, insisted Thursday that the directives were not aimed at China in particular. Sources in the administration say the orders could allow Trump to avoid detailed trade discussions with the Chinese leader by citing the ongoing study.

The second order will address the failure of U.S. agencies to collect anti-dumping penalties. Foreign manufacturers often avoid paying these by exporting to the U.S. through under-capitalized shell companies that lack the funds to pay the penalties. The order will require foreign companies exporting to the U.S. to have financial resources that can be drawn upon to pay penalties for trade abuses.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2a3e3d2f:15577bf:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Rosie O’Donnell’s apparent preoccupation with President Donald Trump’s family members kicked up a notch this week when the actress offered First Lady Melania Trump some unsolicited marriage advice.

On Wednesday, Mrs. Trump’s Twitter account @FLOTUS posted the following message: “I urge you to not be afraid to fail, as failure will never have the power to define you, as long as you learn from it.”

To which the comedienne responded: “which is y u need to divorce him. take ur son n parents and FLEE [sic].”

@FLOTUS – which is y u need to divorce him – take ur son n parents and FLEE — ROSIE (@Rosie) March 29, 2017

O’Donnell has been very outspoken about her disdain for the president, and their infamous feud dates back nearly a decade. She has previously called Trump an “orange piece of sh*t” and a “bully” who is “not even qualified to run a game show.”

The former View co-host has spent months attacking Trump’s family members.

After President Trump’s election victory, O’Donnell shared a video on social media that questioned whether or not Trump’s youngest son, Barron, was autistic. O’Donnell eventually apologized to Melania Trump for posting the video.

In February, O’Donnell led a protest outside the White House ahead of the president’s first joint address to Congress.

“We have seen what you have done, sir. We have seen your connection with Russia. The game is over,” O’Donnell said then, later vowing: “We will get him out!”

Former Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow to discuss a range of issues, including leaks and sabotage by the so-called “Deep State” to damage President Trump’s administration, sanctuary cities, and more.

Tancredo discussed eliminating sanctuary cities via a bill he has pushed in Colorado, stating, “Look, this isn’t that hard to try and figure out here. ‘Think about this,’ I said. ‘You’re a mayor, and for some reason, you decide to announce that anybody that escapes from any jail or prison in the United States, if they can get to your city, you will provide them sanctuary. That is to say, if they come into contact with your police department, you will not report it to the authorities. And let’s say people do escape, and people actually do get to your city, and they commit mayhem when they get there.&apos;”

He continued, “Now, do you not think that because the bill actually requires, [it] would make people who voted for this and the authorities in these cities personally liable? And so, I said, ‘Don’t you think that, indeed, that is what’s happened – that anybody who does something that stupid, any elected official should, should not be held liable when something occurs, like what is happening throughout this country?&apos;”

“Literally thousands,” he went on. “I know it’s hard to believe this because we’ll see snippets, we’ll see one or two stories about somebody who’s been killed, other acts of mayhem committed by people who are here illegally, who are in sanctuary cities, who have come to the attention of police in those cities, but they were never turned over to ICE. And I said, ‘But there are literally thousands of people who have been killed in this country – thousands. So think of the families. Think of what has happened here because of this idiotic politically correct policy that people want to put in place.’ And you are absolutely right. It is not popular.”

Continued Tancredo, “It is something we could go after. If we don’t get it from the legislature, I encourage people here in Colorado and anywhere else in the nation – there are twenty-three- or-four states that allow the initiative process – I would put it on the ballot everywhere I could because it’s a winner, and it should be done. You know, it’s a good thing to do to stop sanctuary cities.”

Tancredo went on to cite a Colorado tragedy from 2008 involving an illegal immigrant driver:

A 3-year-old boy who died in an ice cream shop was buried Wednesday by heartbroken family members, friends and strangers touched by his death. Marten Kudlis and two women were killed in a chain-reaction crash last week in Aurora. The two women were in a pickup truck, making a left turn at Havana and Mississippi, when they were broadsided by a speeding sport utility vehicle. Their pickup truck was shoved into a Baskin Robbins shop and Kudlis, who was sitting by the window waiting for ice cream, was thrown out by the impact. The toddler died at the hospital. The two women — Patricia Guntharp, 49, and Debra Serecky, 51 — died at the scene. At the start of Wednesday’s service, held at the chapel at Fairmount Cemetery, Marten’s father cried, “I really loved him.”

Charges were not resolved until 2010 when Francis Hernandez received a lengthy sentence:

Even though the man accused of killing his little boy was found guilty and may face more than 100 years in prison, Marat Kudlis was not a happy man on Tuesday. “This guy is a baby killer,” said Kudlis, the father of Marten Kudlis, who was killed in a crash at an Aurora ice cream shop in 2008 along with two others. The boy was 3 years old. Francis Hernandez, 25, was convicted on 19 criminal counts related to the crash, including vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of an accident involving death, and child abuse resulting in death. Hernandez moved here with his parents from Guatemala when he was young and was in the U.S. illegally. He had been arrested for numerous traffic offenses and other violations, but authorities failed to deport him.

Recalling the incident Friday, Tancredo, seemingly choked up, said, “This guy had been arrested six times in that same jurisdiction for various things, from DUIs to drug possession but never, ever turned over to ICE. Now, you tell me that someone isn’t liable under those circumstances. How they sleep with themselves, how they sleep, I don’t know how they look at themselves in the mirror. These politicians that have voted for this stuff, how do you live with yourself when you know your decisions have led directly to the death or other forms of mayhem being committed in your jurisdiction – because of your decisions? It’s astounding to me how they can live with themselves.”

During an interview with author, “Stone Cold Truth” host, and Trump adviser Roger Stone Jr. on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher,” host and comedian Bill Maher argued that it appears that President Donald Trump “and his crime family” were “installed” by the Russians “to loot and destroy” the United States of America.

Maher said, “It looks like Donald Trump and his crime family were installed by Russia to loot and destroy America.”

Maher also asked Stone if it bothered him that “we’re so in touch with the Evil Empire these days?”

On March 25, in the wake of the failure of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), President Trump tweeted a warning and a prediction: “ ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!”

In the first part of this series, we considered Trump’s warning: The question of whether or not Obamacare will “explode.” And our tentative answer was that the national political system, almost certainly, will seek to prevent, or at least contain, any such explosion.

Okay, so now let’s turn to Trump’s prediction that “we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people.”

Trump has, indeed, made some bold promises about his healthcare plan. He has said, for example, that it will be “much less expensive and much better.” And if the failed AHCA fell far short of those aspirations, well, Trump can point out that it really wasn’t his bill; it was the House Republicans’: As he said in the Oval Office on March 24, after AHCA went down, “There were things in this bill I didn’t particularly like.” And as for his own future signature effort on healthcare, if and when that comes, he said, “I’ll tell you what’s going to come out of it is a better bill.”

Indeed, at a March 28 reception for a bipartisan group of senators at the White House, the President, eyeing Sen. Charles Schumer leader of the Senate Democrats, then said, “I know that we are all going to make a deal on healthcare. . . . I have no doubt that that’s going to happen very quickly.” He added, “Hopefully it will start being bipartisan because everybody really wants the same thing.”

Well, not quite everybody, as we saw in the AHCA debate. But here’s what Schumer wants: On the issue of Obamacare “exploding,” he has said, “For the President to say that he’ll destroy it or undermine it, that’s not presidential. That’s petulance. And it’s not going to work.”

And as for working with Republicans to improve Obamacare, Schumer has been blunt as to his basic precondition: “If they would denounce ‘repeal’ . . . then we’ll work with them on improving it and making it better. They can’t continue to want to repeal.” So it’s obvious: If Trumpcare is defined only as health insurance, it will end up looking a lot like Obamacare.

It’s possible, of course, that Trump will choose, in the end, not to work with the Democrats on Obamacare changes. And what will happen then? The Republican Senate Leader, Mitch McConnell, gave the most useful perspective: “I think where we are on Obamacare, regretfully at the moment, is where the Democrats wanted us to be, which is the status quo.”

Such an assessment will cause a lot of glum faces in Republican ranks, as well as declarations of never-say-die defiance. And yet as we shall see, a “great healthcare plan” was never going to come from a rejiggering of insurance. That is, tinkering with finance, alone—shifting, say, more from public to private—is not going to generate a program that’s “less expensive and much better.”

In fact, even a favored solution on the right, interstate competition for health insurance, wouldn’t have much net effect. And why not? Because it would lead to insurance cherrypicking; that is, “young immortals” nationwide would, indeed, get cheaper insurance, because everyone wants to sell insurance to people who aren’t likely to need it.

And yet those savings would mostly come at the expense of the older and sicker, who would have to pay for more to fill up the insurance pool, even as policies became harder to find. (Additionally, of course, the taxpayers could be forced to chip in, further underscoring the point that interstate competition, by itself, wouldn’t save money for the overall system.)

So we can see: If the issue is only moving dollar-numbers around, not much will have changed: For older folks, their health needs won’t be any different just because youngsters can buy less expensive insurance; oldsters that the greatest expenses will all found.

We can also say that a focus on finance—that is, insurance—is never going to address the ultimate problem that confront the health system. That ultimate problem, of course, isn’t money, but rather, health itself.

We can illuminate this point easily enough, by citing a common and dreaded illness, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Today, AD makes no distinction between Obamacare or Ryancare. That is, if a patient is diagnosed with AD—as 5.5 million Americans will be this year—there’s no cure, nor any really meaningful treatment, no matter how much money or insurance the patient might have.

To be sure, a rich, or well insured, AD patient will get better care than one without such resources. But given the current lack of a cure, the patient’s ultimate fate is the same, whether the care is gold-plated or copper-plated. Today, in all AD cases, what’s missing is hope—the hope that comes from a cure. Thus we can see: The key variable is not finance, it’s science. That is, whether or not a cure is available.

Of course, common decency—and patriotism—tells us that we want AD victims of all income levels to be treated with compassion; they are, after all, our fellow Americans. As Trump said during the campaign last year, we’re not going to let them “die sitting in the middle of the street.” And yet sadly, we must conclude that our compassion, essential as it is, will not have all that much impact on the patient’s prognosis—all such care is, to be cold about it, ultimately futile.

Now we can make a further point: Care for AD patients, especially those with dementia, is going to be expensive, no matter what the funding source, public or private. That is, it will be costly. Yes, we must beware of unfeelingly bureaucratic public hospitals that are merely warehouses for the dying, but we must also beware of cost-cutting private facilities that are profit-centers for some bean-counter with a spreadsheet. So we can see: Any system that cares for AD victims will be expensive and yet, at the same time, require a great deal of public scrutiny and supervision to protect the public interest.

Indeed, the labor-intensivity of AD care, absent a good treatment or cure, is what makes such care costly; we can think of all those healthcare workers changing bedpans. Economists have a useful concept to describe this phenomenon: Baumol’s Law. We can sum it up readily: If it’s labor intensive, it will be expensive.

And yet there is an escape from this upward cycle of rising costs. And that escape can be summed up in a word that’s far different from finance. And that word, of course, is science.

Medical science, in fact, is a twofer: It offers relief from the human terror of disease, as well as from the terrible fiscal cost of disease. And we can illustrate this point with a story ripped from the latest headlines: On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug, Ocrelizumab, that is the first medication that finally offers true hope to MS patients. MS, of course, is a terrible wasting disease that affects 400,000 Americans. And if, as with AD, MS sufferers are simply financed by health insurance, private or public, they don’t have much to look forward to. And, of course, the taxpayers can look forward only to massive costs.

To be sure, Ocrelizumab isn’t cheap; it’s projected to cost $65,000 a year. And yet if the drug’s creator, Dr. Stephen Hauser of the University of California, San Francisco, is correct when he says that newly diagnosed MS patients will be able to “look forward to a full life without significant disability,” then the drug will likely pay for itself, as MS patients continue on with their productive lives.

Hope for millions? Cures that pay themselves? Surely we can agree: Now that’s a great healthcare program.

In fact, the news of medical miracles, or at least their prospect, is near-continuous. Recently, scientists in the United Kingdom have figured out how to convert spinach into working heart tissue. That’s right, the green leaf might soon become the new heart.

Meanwhile, at Ohio State, they’re working on creating synthetic blood. And at Case Western Reserve, also in the Buckeye State, they have figured out how quadriplegics can use thought to regain motor control. And in a Manhattan emergency room, they’ve already installed telemedicine portals that, almost literally, enable doctors to be two places at once, thereby dramatically shortening waiting times from hours to minutes. Moreover, there’s even new hope for Alzheimer’s: Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia are developing a possible ultrasound therapy for AD patients.

To be sure, we don’t yet know if any of the approaches described above—will prove effective. Yet still, the history of our collective medical success against other awful maladies—from the bubonic plague to polio to Ebola—gives us ground for cautious optimism. So why not AD, too? And everything else, even new human hearts made of spinach!

So now the real essence of “a great healthcare plan for the people” is starting to come into focus. That is, of necessity, it would put the focus on science, not finance. Yes, of course, finance is necessary, but money by itself won’t cure a thing.

We can sum up the reality: Money is transactional; if cash goes from Smith to Jones, or vice versa, and nothing else, the net benefit of society doesn’t change. By contrast, science is transformational: It transforms both Smith and Jones. The issue is simple: It means extending people’s productive and independent lives. And science has been proven to do that: In 1900, the life expectancy of the average American was less than 50; Today, it’s nearly 80.

Moreover cures transform costs—downward. Aside from the obvious individual gains of better health, there are also societal gains. If we recall that Baumol’s Law speaks to the high cost of labor intensiveness, then we can grasp that a cure for AD would save billions and, over time, trillions on the cost of nurses and caregivers.

The reality of the transformative power of medical science should thus be obvious to all. And yet strangely, for the most part, science has been missing from the Washington, DC, healthcare debate. We might ask ourselves: In the recent fight over AHCA, did the idea of “cures” ever come up? That is, Republicans were trying to save money on healthcare, and yet the notion of helping people to be healthier by curing disease wasn’t part of the debate. As Trump might say, Sad!

One astute Republican observer who gets the point about the transformative power of technology is the veteran politico Alex Castellanos. Two days after the defeat of AHCA, he compared medical progress to computer progress:

Message for Republicans: You don’t replace manual typewriters with bigger manual typewriters. You open up the system to evolve and create laptops and mobile devices. You open up health care to innovate and lower costs by evolving new treatments and cures.

Interestingly, the Trump administration seems to be moving in this direction. On March 27, top White House aide Jared Kushner, the President’s son-in-law, was tapped to lead a White House Office of American Innovation, focused on modernizing the federal government with the latest private-sector thinking. One of Kushner’s specific missions is to think through an overhaul of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and we can all agree that that’s a great place to start.

So here’s one idea, from Dr. Joseph V. Gulfo, MD, of Fairleigh Dickinson University’s Lewis Center for Healthcare Innovation and Technology. In an interview, Gulfo summed up his idea in two words: wearable technology. That is, let’s be sure that all our aging heroes in the VA system have access to the sort of ever-present monitors that could keep them healthier and living longer.

We’re all familiar with consumer health-monitoring devices, such as Fitbit, and any number of wearables and apps, but Gulfo goes further: “With real hospital-equipment-level wearables, we could track vitals, those whose who are not compliant with their regimen [for prescription meds], and those in need of rehab.”

Gulfo adds that such a system of wearables could be implemented quickly, since most of the technology is already available. “We could have one for every veteran, probably within a year. That could be a Trump administration goal.” Translation: If Team Trump is hungry for a quick win that real people would notice, this could be it.

Moreover, we can see in such a program a vision of economic renaissance for US manufacturing: The VA embraces wearable technology, and, at the same time, it stipulates, Buy American.

To be sure, Gulfo’s idea, promising as it might be, is just one of many. But the common thread running through any plan for true healthcare greatness is science, along with its close cousin, technology.

In fact, it’s science that actually cures, while finance merely pays. Paying is important, but curing is more important. So if Trumpcare is ever to be seen as anything different from Obamacare, it will start with science, and then cures.

It’s through a Cure Strategy that we will know that Washington is putting the health of Americans first.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b27dfadfa:13ed869:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Fox News correspondent Adam Housley reported Friday that a well-known and “very senior” former official in the intelligence community, not associated with the FBI, directed the unmasking of private Americans working for or with President Donald Trump’s presidential transition team.

“Unmasking is not unprecedented, but unmasking for political purposes … specifically of Trump transition team members … is highly suspect and questionable,” an intelligence source told Fox News. “Opposition by some in the intelligence agencies who were very connected to the Obama and Clinton teams was strong. After Trump was elected, they decided they were going to ruin his presidency by picking them off one by one.”

Housley said his sources inside the intelligence community reached out to him after mainstream media reports Thursday flagged two White House aides as the sources bringing information to Rep. Devin Nunes (R.-CA), the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

Thursday’s mainstream media narrative was that Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis called Nunes to the White House grounds March 21, where they passed classified information to Nunes that confirmed Obama administration surveillance of the Trump camp. Then, March 22, Nunes went to the White House to present classified information to the president.

This narrative and the Nunes back-and-forth with the White House was ridiculed as an elaborate ruse or proof that Nunes was acting in a bizarre way.

The Housley report is that Thursday’s narrative was not true–and that Cohen-Watnick and Ellis were not sources at all; rather the two men came to the aid of Nunes, who had other sources but needed to use a Sensitive Compartmented Intelligence Facility (SCIF) that was not associated with the whistleblowers’ own agency.

The sources told Fox News that surveillance of the Trump campaign began before Trump became the Republican presidential nominee July 19, and the surveillance had nothing to do with Russia, Housley said.

Intelligence agencies are banned from collecting intelligence on Americans without permission from a judge, but in the course of authorized surveillance Americans are caught in the net. These names are supposed to be masked or disguised, so that their rights are preserved. What Fox News is reporting is that these names were either put in the clear or given flimsy masks, so that their identity was obvious.

The sources also told Housley that Nunes learned about the surveillance and the unmasking in January, before Trump entered the White House, but members of the intelligence community have been uncooperative as the chairman searched for a SCIF, where he could conduct his own deep dive into their portent. Finally, he was able to secure use of the White House SCIF inside the Old Executive Office Building, on the White House grounds, but not in the “White House.”

Fox News investigative reporter Malia Zimmerman also worked on this report.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2771629e:1387e9f:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

What is with this curious — now deafening — silence from former President Barack Obama on these charges that his administration spied on a political opponent at the very height of a presidential campaign?

Since President Trump first leveled the incendiary charges in early March, there have been thousands of press articles and endless hours of speculation on cable television about the high-level accusations.

Every word, character, and symbol of punctuation from Mr. Trump has been parsed and sussed and diagrammed.

Yet, from media darling Barack Obama (about whom the accusations were made!)? Not a peep.

This is no small thing we are talking about here. We are talking about a sitting president’s administration using the terrifying powers of espionage of the United States government to conduct an intelligence operation against a political opponent before, during and after that target was elected president of the United States.

So much for “peaceful transfer of power.”

This would be 10 times more serious than Watergate. We are talking a constitutional crisis the likes of which we have never seen in modern times.

And all anybody around here seems to want to talk about is the exhaustively investigated — yet still unsubstantiated — conspiracy theories about Mr. Trump’s supposed ties to Russia.

Well, what about Mr. Obama? Did he actually morph into Russian President Vladimir Putin himself? Did he turn the White House into the Kremlin?

Those are much graver charges than whether somebody has “ties” to the Russians. And so many of the questions about Mr. Obama’s involvement in spying on his political enemy remain unanswered.

Actually, they remain unasked at this point.

And before you dismiss these questions as crazy tweets from a crazy dictator, remember that Mr. Trump’s national security adviser was fired after he was — indisputably — wiretapped and unmasked during the time he was serving on Mr. Trump’s transition team. This alone would be utterly unbelievable in a world before Oliver Stone’s movie “Snowden.”

So, what say you, Mr. Obama?

Crickets.

The only statement from Mr. Obama was a carefully worded non-denial issued by a spokesman.

“A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,” the statement began.

This would seem to merely confirm that Mr. Trump was being investigated by the Obama Administration — but that Mr. Obama’s fingerprints would not be found anywhere on that investigation.

And, yes, this is the same corrupt administration that featured the attorney general meeting in a private plane on a tarmac with the husband of the woman who was supposed to be Mr. Obama’s successor — while she was under investigation by the FBI.

The Obama spokesman’s statement went on to say: “As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.”

Here again, they are playing a silly game. Instead of answering the real question, they are hiding behind the loose and imprecise language of Mr. Trump’s tweet where he shorthands the whole accusation in less than 140 digits by saying “Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower.”

Any logical human knows what Mr. Trump meant by this. I don’t think any serious person actually thought Mr. Obama himself in a hard hat and work gloves with wire snips was in the walls at Trump Tower twisting wires together.

Obviously, Mr. Trump meant that he and his campaign and transition team had been spied upon by U.S. intelligence services at the behest of — or with knowledge of — the sitting U.S. president.

Monumental charges. Yet no denial from the former president.

On Mr. Obama’s Twitter feed, he has opined about Chuck Berry, International Women’s Day and even Valentine’s Day. But not a peep about the serious charges lodged against him.

This, at a time when we are told that Mr. Obama plans to lead the political resistance against Mr. Trump. He should begin by “resisting” these charges.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer ripped into the media on Friday for continuing to ask questions about a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia, noting that there’s been no evidence of that.

“Everyone who’s been briefed on this subject, from Republican to Democrat to CIA — former Obama administration’s [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper, [CIA Director John] Brennan, you name it — all of the people come back with the same conclusion…that there’s been no evidence,” he said at the White House press briefing.

Spicer said if anyone was trying to engage with Russia, it was Hillary Clinton.

“It was Hillary Clinton, who was the architect of the last administration’s failed reset policy — she told Russian state TV that it was designed to strengthen Russia. That was their goal: to strengthen Russia,” he said.

“She used her office to make concession after concession, selling off one-fifth of our country’s uranium, paid speeches, paid deals, getting personal calls from Vladimir Putin. I think if there’s — really want to talk about a Russian connection and the substance, that’s where we should be looking,” he added.

Spicer was referring to how in 2010, then-Secretary of State Clinton was one of nine to sign off on Russia’s purchase of a controlling stake in Uranium One, an international mining company headquartered in Canada. Around the same time, a Russian investment bank paid Bill Clinton $500,000 to give a speech.

“When you talk about connections to Russia, the only connection that anyone’s made with President Trump is multiple years ago he hosted a pageant there and he’s — some of the — you know, he owns condos around the world and some of them were sold to some Russians and I think he sold a house to one several years back. That’s his connection,” he said.

“So when you compare the two sides in terms of who’s actually engaging with Russia, trying to strengthen them, trying to act with them, trying to interact with them, it is night and day between our actions and her actions,” he said. “And yet no one questioned what she was doing or how she was handling it.”

Critics of President Trump have argued that his campaign aides colluded with Russia to help him get elected.

While intelligence officials have assessed that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. elections in favor of Trump by hacking into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton aide John Podesta and leaking embarrassing emails, there has been no evidence that Russia affected the outcome of the election or that there was collusion with Trump campaign officials.

The FBI is investigating the matter, and the House and Senate intelligence committees are also investigating it. But Clapper told NBC News on March 5 that no evidence existed that showed any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

“Not to my knowledge,” he said, when asked if any evidence existed. Clapper said there could have been information found since he left the government on January 20, but as of then, “We had no evidence of such collusion.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2755d2a3:11fa79e:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

It’s been nearly two months since the Federal Reserve said its long-running general counsel Scott Alvarez will retire this year and no replacement has been named.

The process of naming a new general counsel is complicated by widespread expectations that current Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will not be reappointed by President Donald Trump after her term expires in 2018, according to people familiar with the situation.

“No one wants to take the job of being ‘Janet Yellen’s lawyer’ only to be shown the door when Trump appoints a Trump-y chair,” said a Federal Reserve official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Alvarez’s retirement will bring an end to his 36-year career at the central bank. He has been general counsel for the last 12 years, guiding the Fed through the financial crisis and the implementation of the regulations stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.

Although Alvarez’s tenure as general counsel spanned three different Fed chairs, it is widely expected inside the central bank that the next Fed chair could seek to reshuffle the senior staff as part of an effort to shift policy away from the post-crisis regulatory stance of Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke.

“If you look at the administration’s executive orders on financial regulation, it’s clear that they intend to go in a new direction–and that will likely mean a lot of changes in places like the legal division,” according to a person familiar with the matter. As a result, the person said, the next general counsel may wind up serving a very short term.

“A lot of people want the job–just not yet. The top people are gunning to be the replacement for Alvarev’s replacement,” another person at the central bank said.

Big changes are afoot at the Fed. In addition to the coming retirement of Alvarez, Fed governor Dan Tarullo has announced he will retire as soon as next month. Tarullo has served as the de facto head of financial regulation at the Fed despite never being formally appointed as the Vice Chair for Supervision, a new position created by the Dodd Frank Act but never filled by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has not yet named a Vice Chair for Supervision or a successor for Tarullo.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2755d2a3:11fa79d:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Kendrick Lamar has released the music video for his new song “Humble,” which sees the California rapper go from golfing atop a car to portraying himself as Jesus Christ at the Last Supper.

The Dave Meyers and the Little Homies-directed music video begins with Lamar rapping about making money as we see him lying on top of a pile of cash next to half-naked women putting dollar bills into money-counting machines.

The camera constantly cuts in and out of that scene and one in which Lamar is seen wearing a bishop’s robes, standing in the middle of a dark building.

Then come the song’s chorus, “Hol’ up, bitch, sit down. Hol’ up lil’ bitch, hol’ up lil’ bitch. Be humble,” as the Grammy-winner sends a golf ball flying from atop a car parked in the middle of a massive storm drain.

The chorus continues to echo as the camera pans to show Lamar sitting at a table surrounded by what appear to be his apostles in an apparent rendering of the Last Supper.

Lamar’s head is on fire in the next few scenes, as the rapper name drops former President Barack Obama.

“This shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy. I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy,” he raps.

Obama and the “King Kunta” rapper have history, as Lamar was a frequent guest at the Obama White House.

“Humble” is the second song in as many weeks from Lamar. Last week’s “The Heart Part 4” trashed President Donald Trump as a “chump.”

“Donald Trump is a chump, know how we feel, punk. Tell ’em that God comin’. And Russia need a replay button, y’all up to somethin’,” Lamar raps on the political track. “Electoral votes look like memorial votes. But America’s truth ain’t ignorin’ the votes.”

The Trump White House seems quietly to be enjoying the Russia hacking “scandal.”

Certainly it has its day-to-day frustrations, especially for Sean Spicer, who has to face the press corps and its obsession with meaningless minutiae.

But the joke is on the journalists. They are spending so much time on the non-story that they are missing what President Donald Trump is actually doing. He complains on Twitter about the coverage, but the truth is that the distraction is very useful.

The “scandal” is no longer about Russia. Now it is about how House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) found information backing up Trump’s claims that his team was under surveillance by the Obama administration.

Was Nunes approached by whistleblowers who came to his congressional office? Or were the whistleblowers sent by the White House to Nunes? It makes no difference at all, but the media think they are onto something very important.

CNN called it a “cover-up,” without specifying what, exactly, Nunes was supposed to be “covering up.” And the answer is: nothing.

Even if — for argument’s sake — the White House had approached Nunes rather than the other way around, the worst that could be said about it is that Nunes behaved like a partisan Republican. If so, he is no more partisan than ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), who is abusing his position to launch conspiracy theories against the GOP.

The core of Schiff’s case, as presented at the House Intelligence Committee last Monday, is a lie — namely, the false claim that the Republican Party altered its platform at the behest of Trump aides in order to appease the Russians. As Byron York of the Washington Examiner has demonstrated, the Republican platform was “was actually strengthened, not weakened” against Russia.

Schiff is still pretending that some other evidence will emerge on Trump-Russia ties. But the idea Russia colluded with the Trump campaign is ludicrous, for three reasons.

The first is there is no evidence whatsoever to support that claim. Obama’s own James Clapper and Mike Morell even said so — though it took Trump’s tweets about “wiretapping” to flush them out of hiding.

Second, the Russians could not have known that Trump would win, and would not have targeted Clinton alone when it seemed that she could exact punishment once she took office.

The third reason is that Hillary Rodham Clinton was arguably the most pro-Russian official since Alger Hiss. From the Russian “reset,” to giving up missile defense, to the one-sided New START treaty, to the uranium giveaway, to the loss of the Middle East, and to the loss of the Crimea (which happened on her successor’s watch, while she remained silent), Clinton ran the State Department almost like a post-Soviet satellite.

Indeed, if Donald Trump really wanted to appease Russian President Vladimir Putin, it would be hard to find anything left with which to appease him. The Russians saw Trump’s criticism of NATO as useful, and applauded him. But they likely preferred Clinton.

Already, Trump has been much tougher on Russia than Obama ever was. From blasting Russia at the UN Security Council over the eastern Ukraine, to threatening to tear up the New START treaty, Trump has opposed Putin — and it shows. Trump foreign policy adviser Sebastian Gorka, formerly of Breitbart News, is also a vociferous critic of Russia.

So the Russia “scandal” is much ado about nothing. But it keeps the media distracted from what Trump is really doing — such as taking a chainsaw to Obama’s regulations — and it keeps the Democrats from developing an actual message.

The beauty of it all? Aside from Trump’s tweets, the media and the Democrats are creating this distraction themselves.

SiriusXM host Alex Marlow welcomed billionaire businessman Mark Cuban of ABC’s Shark Tank to Breitbart News Daily on Friday.

Marlow asked Cuban about his “Radical Transport” Kickstarter campaign to create hoverboards with two key features previous products lacked: they will be made in the U.S., and they will not explode.

“It’s made in the United States. We have a few parts we have to import, that we couldn’t make here. It’s going to be assembled in Dallas, so it’s going to be made with a lot more care,” Cuban explained.

“We’re UL-approved, which the previous boards out of China were not,” he noted. “Everything is redesigned. It’s all-new intellectual property. The previous hoverboards, they were designed to push the price down, be as inexpensive as possible, and appeal to as many kids as possible. We’ve taken a completely different approach: All-new intellectual property, a whole new design. It’s a lot more responsive. It’s a lot safer from a manufacturing perspective.”

“It’s a lot more oriented toward high-performance riders, if you will. Believe it or not, there’s a group of people who don’t just want to ride them around the house or the driveway. They want to do tricks and kind of be an alternative to skateboards. That’s the market we’re going after, so they’ll be a little bit more expensive, too,” he said.

Cuban said that in all of his companies, “we’re not allowed to buy anything overseas until we’ve priced it here in the United States first.”

“There are some products we just can’t get here, like with the Mavericks, I can’t get my T-shirts all made here. They’re twice as expensive. But anything else, all the tchotchkes, whatever we give away, it always has to be priced here in the United States, just in case something’s changed. If it’s even close, the tie goes to the U.S.A. company,” he said.

Marlow saluted Cuban, a supporter of Hillary Clinton in 2016 and critic of President Donald Trump, for appearing on Breitbart News Daily.

“I like facilitating dialogue between people who disagree,” said Marlow. “You’d be shocked at how hard it is to get Hillary supporters to come on a show like this and talk to me.”

Cuban in turn applauded Marlow and the Breitbart News Daily crew for welcoming such guests when they do appear.

“I agree with you. I take the same approach. I don’t need to go and talk to people who agree with me. We already agree,” he said. “I learn from people who disagree with me. I call it checking my hole card: you know what you have underneath there, but you’re always checking to make sure you’re still being consistent in your thoughts. I want people to challenge me. That’s how I get smarter. That’s how I learn.”

“I try not to be an ideologue about anything. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong, and I’m willing to evolve. Coming on a show like this is a great opportunity for me,” he added, stressing that he was not a partisan for the left or the Democratic Party, but an independent.

Cuban agreed with Marlow that the healthy exchange of ideas was vital, especially in a time when so many people are living in ideological bubbles or actively calling for the suppression of speech with which they disagree.

“I don’t know if there’s necessarily a ‘crackdown’ on free speech, but I do agree with you that we kind of insulate ourselves and tend to live in our own little bubbles,” he said. “We tend to see the news with which we agree. To me, that’s a real problem. It was a problem during the election, and it continues to be.”

“When we have two people that disagree or groups that disagree, if we can have an open dialogue, we both get a chance to get a little smarter, and that’s always a good thing,” he said.

Cuban said he could not divulge the details of his private meeting with White House strategist and former Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon months ago.

“The heart of the matter is, I’ve known Steve since the late 90s, early 2000s, when he was in the entertainment business, so it was just a chance to catch up,” he said. “He ran a company called The Firm, which did a lot of work in Hollywood, so I had occasion to meet with him. We have a good relationship. But again, like us, we don’t have to agree on everything, but we can certainly discuss it all.”

Marlow asked if President Trump’s success was inspirational as Cuban pursues his own political ambitions or if it “terrifies you that Trump is the president.”

“I would say it inspires me because we’re so different,” Cuban replied, after laughing at the phrasing of the question. “I think the commonality is that we’re both businesspeople, but we take a completely different approach to how we do business. If you’ve read anything I’ve said, I haven’t been a big fan of his approach. I have been a fan of some of his economic policies.”

“I’m trying to be open-minded and see what works and what doesn’t work,” he said. “A lot of my – I wouldn’t call them political aspirations, but more willingness to get out there and talk more about these things – is just from my desire to learn and my desire to do what’s best for the country.”

Cuban added that as an entrepreneur, he has “a desire to try to help create as many jobs as possible.”

“These days, more than ever, politics and entrepreneurship intersect,” he observed.

He thought it was not quite right to say that he and Trump are similar in background and personality but diametrically opposed politically because there are issues upon which they agree.

“I believe in lower taxes. I believe in more efficient government. I believe in reducing bureaucracy. I believe that we shouldn’t have lobbyists who can go in or former government workers who can come back and lobby. So in a lot of respects, we’re very much the same,” he said.

“I disagree with him on trade, but I think he’s evolving his trade position. You know, he’s backed off on NAFTA. He’s backed off on the border adjustment tax stuff, at least from initial appearances. He’s not been as aggressive on trying to not work with other countries,” Cuban said of Trump.

“I think there’s a lot of things that we’re on the same page about, but those are more conservative values, I think, than they are Donald Trump values. Where I disagree with him vehemently is that he doesn’t do a good job of communicating, and I don’t think he has great leadership skills. I say that based off of a long history in investing in companies and working with a lot of different corporate leaders. That’s where I really take issue with him,” he explained.

Cuban strove to make a distinction between President Trump’s ability to draw large crowds at his rallies and the kind of leadership skills to which he was referring.

“Going to a rally is part of an entertainment and part of a social gathering. More power to him, right? Whether there’s 15 or 50,000, more power to him for bringing them in, more power for getting them excited. He is a good marketer. He gets credit for that,” Cuban allowed.

“But once you get the job – this may not seem like a great analogy, but trying to get an investor, whether it’s from Shark Tank or me or anybody investing in your company, that’s an accomplishment. But once you get the investment, you have to run the company profitably,” he continued. “You have to be able to execute on the things that you’ve said the company is going to do.”

“Donald Trump going out there and holding rallies. That’s him bringing in the investors, the voters. Now that he’s been elected, it’s time for him to execute and be a leader and try to take the entire country – not just the people who voted for him – to a place that’s best for the United States. That’s the challenge for him right now, from my perspective,” he said.

Cuban observed that Trump “didn’t campaign as a politician, but he’s becoming a politician.”

“I think there’s a variety of business leaders, from Bill Gates to Warren Buffett to – not Mark Zuckerberg, but Sheryl Sandberg, people that I respect as businesspeople. Howard Schultz,” he added, offering some examples of the leadership style he believes Trump should emulate.

“Put aside their politics. They’ve taken companies that have tens of thousands – even Rex Tillerson, right? People have taken companies with tens of thousands of employees, and despite the varied political viewpoints of those employees, have put them working together towards a common goal that has led to significant accomplishments for the company and for the people at that company,” he said.

“That’s the position he’s in right now, that he’s got to achieve. That’s where a lot of people had hoped he would be able to deliver with business acumen and business skills as a leader. I don’t believe he has,” Cuban said of Trump.

Marlow asked if Cuban would agree Rex Tillerson was a “bold pick of the president, to put a CEO into the secretary of state position.”

“I have no problem with it. I thought it was a good pick, simply because Rex has managed 75,000 people,” Cuban said. “I had no problem with that pick at all. But now, look at whether Donald Trump, President Trump, is letting Rex Tillerson do his job. We haven’t seen Rex Tillerson stand up and say, ‘This is my vision for the State Department.’ We haven’t seen him stand up. Where he’s stood up and spoken has almost been a contradiction to what the president has said in terms of policy.”

“And so you’re starting to see that bifurcation, those challenges between the people that he’s picked for these cabinet positions and the positions they’re taking when they’re out there doing their jobs and the positions the president has taken when he’s tried to communicate with the people. That’s a problem. That’s a leadership issue,” he argued.

Turning to some specific issues, Marlow brought up health care, which he noted Cuban has referred to as a “right.” He asked Cuban to explore that logic by explaining why people don’t have an equivalent “right” to food and housing.

“Let’s take a step back,” Cuban began. “First of all, we all have to eat, we all need a place to live, and we all get sick. We all play that genetic lottery. No one dies healthy. You’re going to get sick. Everybody you know is going to get sick.”

“The decision we make as a country is, how much are we going to help people when they get sick? Because when someone gets sick and they don’t have the means to pay for their health care, we pay for it anyway,” he contended. “You pay for it. I pay for it. All taxpayers pay for it, one way or the other. There’s nobody who gets sick and we just let die. There’s nobody that gets sick and there’s no economic consequences.”

“So from my perspective, the question isn’t is it a right because it’s in the Constitution, or why not food, why not everything else. The question is, what’s the best economic course for the United States? What’s the best economic course for the American people?” he asked.

“The reality is, given we all have to pay for everybody’s health care – whether it’s directly or indirectly – I’d rather see us just take on this problem and say, ‘Let’s do it’ in the most cost-efficient manner.”

“And because health care, really, we all face the same genetic risk. We all face the same randomness of life risk, where you can be in an accident, et cetera, when you’re able to spread the cost among everybody for – not all healthcare issues; if you sprain your ankle, that’s on you. If you break your finger, that’s on you, right? But if you get a chronic illness, if you get a serious illness or life-threatening illness, that’s something I think we should all share the cost in because we all face the same unknowns and the same risks,” he said.

“And when we have people that fall through the cracks, and we don’t pay for them, we end up paying more indirectly. When someone has to go to the hospital because they don’t have insurance – and by the way, I think the insurance companies should be out of the mix altogether – but when someone needs health care and they don’t have the ability to pay for it, in our communities, we end up paying for it one way or the other. That means my property taxes go up. That means sales taxes go up in order to pay for a local hospital, local medical services, et cetera,” he said.

“I would rather just all of us recognize that these are shared risks and share in paying the costs – not for all healthcare issues, like I mentioned, but for chronic and serious injuries and healthcare problems. For everything else, just leave a free and open market. You’re taking the greatest cost away from the insurance companies,” Cuban said.

“Now, the insurance companies will hate it because they’re making twenty percent,” he added. “They make a twenty percent VIG off of all those costs. Their net income might only be about seven percent, but when insurance companies are doing $180 billion or $160 billion in revenue, that could fall to $30 billion. So they’re going to hate this idea.”

“But the reality is, we all pay for each others’ health care, directly or indirectly,” he stressed. “As a businessperson, as an entrepreneur, I’d rather just say, ‘What’s the best way to solve the problem of health care?’ rather than just putting it all into the government as, ‘Okay, you come up with Obamacare or an alternative.’ I don’t think that’s the right way to do it.”

Another issue Cuban has been involved with is student loan debt.

“We’ve got a problem, and I’ve been speaking about this for years,” he said. “I said the same thing to Obama when Secretary Clinton came out with her suggestion that all student loans should basically be dismissed and college should be free. I said that was a bad idea. I told her that was a bad idea.”

“Right now, I think the cost of tuition has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, simply because there’s too much easy money to be borrowed for tuition,” he explained. “Now, I have no problem with Pell grants. I have no problem with basic loans, up to $5700, I think it is. But what’s happening now is, private lenders are lending to families thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollars per year in some cases. And because that money is so easy to borrow, it’s really easy just for colleges to continue to increase their tuition.”

“I’m not suggesting that we dismiss all loans that students have, even though that’s what some people would like,” he emphasized. “But what I am suggesting is, if we’re going to arrest the increases and inflation in college tuition and living expenses, we’re going to have to end the easy money.”

“Whatever the number is, I’d like to see a cap on the amount of money that a family could borrow in any given year and in total,” he suggested. “If you do that, the easy money stops for colleges. They have to become more efficient.”

“Right now, particularly big public universities, they’ll have more administrators making over $200,000 a year than they have teachers or professors making over $200,000 a year,” Cuban pointed out. “The economics are just wrong in universities. They’ll have a sociology building, a psychology building, a business building – none of which has unique features that are required for their teaching purposes, but they’re there just because a donor paid for them. I think all that just creates tuition inflation, and that needs to change.”

Cuban disagreed with Marlow that too many university resources are devoted to liberal arts classes that have few applications in the working world.

“I think right now the argument could be made that liberal arts majors aren’t going to make as much, and it’s far more difficult to get a job,” he countered. “But we’re going to go through a complete change in the nature of work over the next five to ten years.”

“What’s happening with artificial intelligence and its derivatives and robotics, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks – if you work for software, or if you are in a position that you’re doing the same job, or it’s a repetitive job, over and over, or if you’re in a rules-based job – if this, then that – there’s a good chance your job’s going to be displaced over the next ten years,” he predicted.

“As we get more into a machine learning/deep learning environment, we’re going to need more free thinkers who know how to use data than we’ll need people who maybe were bookkeepers or accountants, even some lawyers. Those jobs, because they’re rules-based, there’s not going to be a need for those. We’re literally going to have machines more capable of doing that. It used to be that we told machines what to do. Now we’re asking machines what to do,” said Cuban.

Marlow clarified that he was concerned about students who incur enormous debt earning degrees that offer them no real prospect of repaying the debt through gainful employment. He cited someone he knows personally who incurred $200,000 in student loan debt to earn a Women’s and Gender Studies degree, realized it was of little use to her career ambitions, and started over as a medical student, studying alongside his wife.

“Two questions there,” Cuban responded. “One, she went to the wrong school. She went to a school that was too expensive. She didn’t go to a school she could afford. That was the first issue, and that was her choice. She’s obviously dealing with the consequences.”

“Two, it’s all going to change. We don’t know what the best jobs are going to be in ten years, for the reasons I mentioned earlier,” he continued. “Between robotics and deep learning/machine learning, not to get too technical, the nature of work is going to change. There’s going to be significant displacement. I don’t have a relationship with the administration, but the people I know that work in and around the White House that I have been able to talk to, that’s the overriding theme that I’ve been preaching to them.”

“This goes back to an issue I have with President Trump: he doesn’t have a curiosity to learn. He doesn’t a quest for knowledge,” Cuban charged. “Part of that has led to his excitement over creating factories and what he calls ‘bringing in jobs.’ The reality is – write this down – look at the companies that he is saying are opening up factories, and make a note for their total employment the day he makes an announcement – whether it’s Ford, GM, whoever it may be. And then two years from now, look at the total employments for those companies. I guarantee you, the total number of employees for those companies will be down because the factories that President Trump is so excited about will lead to fewer jobs, not more jobs.”

“Technology marches on,” he mused. “That’s not a bad thing. I’d rather have that technology be hosted in the United States, where we have some level of control over our own destiny, than those factores be created in China where they are being created, and they are changing the cost and the nature of work there already. The point being that unless you recognize the changes and disruption that are coming in the very short term, it’s going to be very difficult to say, ‘Okay, this is the type of classes you should take.’”

“And so I’ve said publicly, I don’t have a problem with a women’s studies major if they’re smart, if they’re inquisitive, if they’re willing to continue to learn. I tell this to all my friends and their kids, et cetera, and my own kids – my oldest is 13 – the greatest skill that you can have is a thirst for knowledge, loving and learning how to learn because things are going to be changing so dramatically over the next ten years in terms of technology that we don’t know what the best jobs are going to be. So we’re all going to have to continue to learn how to find new skills,” he said.

“Now, your wife and her friend, they’re in great shape. You talk about, going back a little bit to health care, if it was up to me, one of the programs I would start is a program that paid to have more doctors because if we’re going to push down the cost of health care, we should subsidize the cost of medical school – not to any amount that the school would charge us, but offer your wife $50,000 a year, and make it available not just to her, but so that instead of there being 90,000 med students in school in any given year, there are 180,000 med students in school in any given year. We spend the $900 million or $1 billion a year, whatever it may be, knowing that that increased competition, because we have more doctors, is going to push down the cost of medical care,” said Cuban.

“Those are the types of things that I think, if we start to anticipate what’s coming down the pike in the future, we can be smarter and have an impact on health care, on insurance costs, on medical costs. There’s just so many things that we can do. Again, I’ll go back to the president: these aren’t the types of conversations that are being held in the White House. They’re looking backwards to the way things used to be and trying to recreate those, as opposed to looking forward to the way things should be,” he said.

Department of Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth, an Obama appointee, is treating the February 24 leak of a draft DHS document central to the separate decisions by two federal judges revoking President Trump’s travel ban on March 15 differently than he did the April 2, 2015 unauthorized leak of private information about Rep. Jason Chaffetz from the employment files of the Secret Service. One day after the Chaffetz leak, DHS announced an OIG investigation. More than one month after the leak of the draft DHS document, published in a February 24 Associated Press story written by Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell, DHS is silent as to whether an investigation has been or will be launched. On April 2, 2015, the Daily Beast reported that “House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, who oversees the Secret Service, never disclosed that he had applied for and was rejected from the agency in the early 2000s,” in an article written by reporter Tim Mak. Mak did not disclose in the article how he first learned of Chaffetz’s application to the Secret Service, which has been a part of the Department of Homeland Security since 2003. One day later, on April 3, 2015 CNN reported, “Senior staff from the House committee that oversees the Secret Service have asked the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General to look into allegations that U.S. Secret Service employees circulated private personnel information about committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz.” “Chaffetz’s office confirmed that the House Oversight Committee chairman applied unsuccessfully to a job with the Secret Service in 2003,” CNN reported, adding: The Secret Service referred CNN to the investigation being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General as to whether any policies were violated. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson apologized to Chaffetz in a phone call Thursday night for the congressman “being put in the situation that he had to acknowledge a matter that should have been kept confidential,” according to DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron. Johnson also called for an investigation into the matter, Catron said. “We conducted this investigation from April 2, 2015 to August 21, 2015,” the final report, “Investigation into the Improper Access and Distribution of Information Contained Within a Secret Service Data System,” made public on September 25, 2015 by DHS Inspector General John Roth—an Obama appointee who has held over into the Trump administration—noted. DHS Inspector General Roth’s quick pursuit of an investigation into the unauthorized leak of Congressman Chaffetz’s employment application to the Secret Service stands in stark contrast to his silence, and the department’s silence, on its reaction to the unauthorized leak of a draft DHS document, published in a February 24 AP story written by Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell, that was cited as key evidence in the separate decisions by two federal judges on March 15 to revoke President Trump’s travel ban.

“As a matter of policy, DHS neither confirms nor denies the potential existence of ongoing investigations,” DHS spokesperson Gillian Christensen tells Breitbart News.

While that silence on “the potential existence of ongoing investigations” may be the current policy, it was apparently not the department’s policy on April 3, 2015 when a spokesperson for the Secret Service confirmed the existence of a DHS OIG investigation into the Secret Service leak about Rep. Chaffetz.

Nor does that policy appear to apply to a recent highly publicized DHS OIG investigation related to the implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order 13769—the initial temporary travel bans for citizens of seven Middle Eastern countries–Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Iraq (the only one of the seven countries not included in the subsequent Executive Order 13780).

On February 1, four days after President Trump signed Executive Order 13769, “The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG) announced that it will review DHS’ implementation of the recent Executive Order,“Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.” The review is being initiated in response to congressional request and whistleblower and hotline complaints:

In addition to reviewing the implementation of the Executive Order, the OIG will review DHS’ adherence to court orders and allegations of individual misconduct on the part of DHS personnel. If circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.

The leaked draft DHS document published in the February 24 AP story was three pages in total, and had no letterhead nor any other markings to indicate it originated in the DHS, nor did it bear the name or signature of any current DHS employee. The authors of the story, however, asserted that it originated within the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, an assertion not disputed by a spokesperson for DHS, who did note, however, that it was an “incomplete” and “draft” document and not an authorized official position of DHS.

The leaked document did however, cite another DHS document in an end note as the source of the data described within it, ” DHS I&amp;A Terrorism-Related Activities Study: 16 FEB 17; DOI 01 Mar 11 – 31 Jan 17; DHS I&amp;A Terrorism-Related Activities Study.”

Breitbart News asked DHS to obtain a copy of this document, as well as a description of its classification status, but did not receive a response to that request.

Information about the classification status of that cited document may play a key role in determining the potential level of criminality involved in the leaking of the draft document. If, for instance, it is a classified document, federal laws have clearly been broken. If it is “classified but sensitive,” federal laws have likely been broken. If it is completely unclassified, prosecutors would have a more difficult time proving violation of federal laws, but the leak would certainly be cause for termination at DHS.

“Generally speaking, DHS employees are held to the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct. Any allegations of misconduct are taken seriously and addressed appropriately,” Christensen adds.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b26b059aa:113efb9:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump devoted Friday’s weekly White House address to praising Judge Neil Gorsuch, his nominee to fill the seat of beloved conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, and pushing for his speedy confirmation by the Senate.

“Judge Gorsuch is incredibly qualified, he has a sterling record, he was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals,” the President said, making his case to the nation as a showdown over Senate cloture rules draws closer. “Judge Gorsuch’s nomination is about more than his incredible qualifications. It’s about preserving our republic,” he continued.

The Senate fight over confirming Gorsuch has reached a fever-pitch over the last week, with the two parties running out of room for compromise. As the Trump Administration and Senate Republicans have signaled their willingness to confirm Gorsuch by any means necessary, increasing numbers of Democrats have insisted they will filibuster any attempt to allow an up-or-down vote on the nominee, making it ever more likely Republicans will move to change Senate rules to allow a simple majority to close debate on Supreme Court nominees.

Democrats, who under current rules need only forty-one votes to block a vote on Gorsuch, themselves used the “constitutional option” to allow simple majority confirmations for non-Supreme Court nominees in 2013. Four more Senate Democrats, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV), and Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), confirmed Friday they will move to filibuster and force the constitutional option.

Senate Democrats are finding themselves under immense pressure to close ranks for this unprecedented filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee, first called for by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) last week. Friday, CREDO, a left-wing “super-PAC,” and a bevy of other progressive activist groups put their names to a letter to be delivered to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee demanding any Democratic Senator who fails to join the filibuster against Gorsuch be stripped of all funding from the national Democratic Party apparatus. “Democrats who refuse to defend the Supreme Court from Donald Trump’s racist, fascist agenda should not receive support for their re-election,” CREDO told supporters on its website.

Only nine Democratic and independent Senators remain who have yet to announce their intentions on the Gorsuch Confirmation, by Breitbart New’s count. In order to confirm Gorsuch without changing traditional Senate rules, six of these would need to join the chamber’s fifty-two Republicans and Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Democrats who have expressed their support for Gorsuch.

Republicans have responded with more open insistence that they will do whatever it takes to confirm Gorsuch. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), in a CNN op-ed urging his Democratic colleagues to reconsider their filibuster, was unequivocal. “Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice. The question is whether Democrats will give him the up-or-down vote he deserves,” he wrote.

Even Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who had as recently as Thursday held out hope a compromise might be reached to preserve the Senate’s traditional cloture rules, walked back from reports of a “deal” Friday. “I’ve had conversations with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. That’s all. There’s no gang. There’s no negotiations. Just having some conversations. No deal. No negotiations,” he told the Daily Caller.

Gorsuch’s confirmation vote is now set for April 7.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b265dbd93:1226342:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Friday on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” NBC’s “Meet the Press” moderator Chuck Todd said President Donald Trump must accept “the fact” that Russia interfered in this election or he will be “on the brink of becoming a temporary lame duck presidency.”

Todd said, “You have a presidency right now that I think is, it’s beyond saying it’s in crisis mode, it’s, you know, it’s on the brink, the question is on the brink of what? Is it on the brink of collapse? Is it on the brink of becoming a temporary lame duck presidency? Maybe it feels lame-duckish temporarily right now. You’ve got a stalled agenda. Republicans who have no fear of this president right now. They don’t think there’s a political penalty to buck him. Obviously, the Russia cloud darkens all of the time, and all of these problems right now that they’re dealing with front and center are self-inflicted by one person, the president of the United States who could not help himself with a tweet on this wiretapping nonsense.”

“That essentially helped unravel ten days of all things Russia in their part of this story,” he continued. “Then throw in the fact that he has decided to drive a wedge in his own party by going after the Freedom Caucus. Okay, but he also attacking Democrats at the same time. He has to go find a dance partner and he is alienating both of his potential dance partners on that front. On the normal political scale, he has problems. Throw in the fact that you have a president that cannot accept the fact that Russia interfered in this election. Until he accepts that fact, it will plague him. The world must be panicked that if he is tested right now by a Putin in the Baltics, by North Korea, is the United States prepared to lead in a crisis right now for the world?”

“Pizza Party Ben,” a popular pro-Trump comedy account and friend of former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos, was suspended without warning on Twitter early Friday.

Attempting to view the account, which had nearly 70,000 followers, will return users with a suspension notice, puzzling fans on the platform as to why he was removed.

“This is my only post that was out of the ordinary yesterday,” claimed Ben in an email to Breitbart Tech, citing a tweet he had posted sarcastically declaring, “I’m Muslim now.”

Pizza Party Ben has previously written for Breitbart News.

Several Twitter users both protested and mourned Ben’s suspension on Friday, with many pointing to the account as simply the next victim of the platform’s unusually-high suspension rate for conservatives, libertarians, and free speech activists.

Pizza Party Ben joins a long list of prominent conservatives and libertarians who have been suspended on Twitter, including Milo Yiannopoulos, rapper Azealia Banks, pharmaceutical entrepreneur Martin Shkreli, DNC hacker Guccifer 2.0, a Saudi women’s rights group, a game developer who criticized Islam, another game developer who called for mosque surveillance, a conservative lawyer, and even Twitter’s free speech-based competitor, Gab.

Breitbart Tech reached out Twitter regarding the suspension but have yet to receive a response.

Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh reacted to President Donald Trump’s tweets aimed at the House Freedom Caucus, which is considered by many to be what kept the American Health Care Act, House GOP leadership’s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, from passing the House.

If @RepMarkMeadows, @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts &amp; reform. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017

Limbaugh mentioned a Politico story describing the House Freedom Caucus leadership as “ringleaders” before saying there was a better way to handle the House Freedom Caucus than calling them out on Twitter.

“Now, to this health care business. As I mentioned earlier today, the president has doubled down on the Freedom Caucus, the 30 or so members of the conservative members of the House of Representatives, The Politico and such others in their headline are referring to the three Freedom Caucus leaders as the ringleaders, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, Raul Labrador. The ringleaders? What do you associate ringleaders with? Ringleaders — crime, gangs,” he said. “Exactly right. Bank robbers. The ringleaders of the group were hiding in the getaway car parked one block down the street.”

“So now these guys are being characterized as ringleaders of some gang, some out-of-control gang in the House, and Trump has doubled down on it,” Limbaugh continued. “Look, folks, calling them out like this, I know it’s Trump’s technique; I know it’s Trump’s method. But there’s a better way of doing this. These guys are not the enemy. The Democrats are the enemy. The Freedom Caucus has actually made a pretty big move here.”

Limbaugh went on to cite a Washington Examiner editorial calling the Freedom Caucus’ conditions reasonable and urging the White House, House Speaker Paul Ryan and congressional GOP centrists to accept those conditions.

“That’s the problem with the first effort: It didn’t kill the law,” Limbaugh said. “It sustained much of it and then put in the hands of the secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, the responsibility of removing a bunch of things from it. And the Freedom Caucus said, ‘We’re not really getting rid of it, if we’re just letting the secretary remove it and nothing else happens, then the next time the Democrats win they can put those things back in. We need to take them out by statute.&apos;”

“But it’s clear that the objective here was to get a win,” he added. “The objective was to really knock it out of the park in the first two months, fulfill a campaign promise, say that Obamacare had been repealed and the replace effort was underway, first phase of three. But the ringleaders of the Conservative Caucus were suspicious that this was not gonna end Obamacare, and they had campaigned promising to do so.”

President Donald Trump welcomed a group of American manufacturing companies to the White House on Friday, announcing the results a new survey from the National Association of Manufacturers.

The survey showed that 93 percent of manufacturers had a positive outlook of the future of their industry up from 56 percent in the previous year. The survey includes 13,000 manufacturing members of the association,

The news marked a 20-year record high for the survey, prompting Trump to claim a “new surge of optimism” for more jobs in the United States, thanks to many of his policies.

Jay Timmons, of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that the optimism centered on Trump’s focus on lowering taxes, cutting regulations, and investing in infrastructure. The survey also showed a jump from 26 percent of members saying that the country was on the right track before the inauguration to over 60 percent in the new survey.

“We appreciate your committment to investment and job creation in manufacturing and we’re going to deliver,” Timmons said.

Several leaders of American manufacturers joined Trump for the event, highlighting the jobs they had created in the United States.

“We’re removing job-killing regulations and lifting the burdens on American industry, like I would say have never been lifted before,” Trump said.

He noted that a lot of manufacturing jobs had been moved to places like Mexico and China. Trump previewed his upcoming meeting with the President of China at his estate in Mar-a-lago.

“It’s going to be something, I think, very important, very special, I look very much forward to meeting him and the delegation and we’ll see what happens,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2626bbf8:108b5fa:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Friday during her speech at Georgetown University, former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticized President Donald Trump for his proposed budget cuts to diplomacy and international aid within the agency she once headed.

Clinton said, “I’m here also to say we are seeing signals of a shift that should alarm us all. This administration’s proposed cuts to international health, development, and diplomacy would be a blow to women and children and a grave mistake for our country. Some of you may have seen the recent letter from more than 120 retired generals and admirals to congress and the administration, urging the congress and the White House not to retreat from these programs which represent our values.”

“These distinguished men and woman who served in uniform recognize that turning our back on diplomacy won’t make our country safer,” she continued. “It will undermine our security and our standing in the world. Defense Secretary Mattis said it well when he said if you cut funds to the State Department, that means he has to buy more ammunition.”

If that is indeed the case, Maddow urged her viewers not to let their guards down against public corruption, especially as there are any other numbers of storylines to pursue while the Trump-Russia saga dominates the news coverage.

Partial transcript as follows:

The news today that we may get testimony in exchange for immunity from fired National Security Advisor Mike Flynn who is in a position potentially to know more about the scandal than anybody else, that news today revs this scandal up into higher gear that we didn’t even know we had in our national transmission, and you know, we will — we here at the show and I think on this network, we will cover this as aggressively as anybody. I think it’s been fair to say we have been as aggressive as anybody on this story already and that will remain the case.

But I want to just plant this flag here — there remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are innocent. There remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are not incident — not innocent, but that this scandal does not prove to be an existential presidency-ending conflagration, even if they are found to have committed very bad acts. There remains the possibility that at the end of this, even if these investigations continue to go as badly as they have for the president thus far, there remains the possibility that the end of all of it, he’s still president and then for the sake of our democracy, we have to figure out how we are going to regain our in tolerance for corruption and scandal and throwing our American ethical and political norms out the window.

One of the consequences already of the Russia attack and it’s aftermath is that what otherwise would be presidency ending scandals in any presidential administration are like, whoo page 15, if you get there, man. I mean, when all this is over and who knows how it ends, if we are ever to regain our previous standing as a liberal democracy, right, there’s going to have to be consequences for, you know, the Carl Icahn stuff for the lying to the Senate stuff, for the personal ethics stuff, for the nepotism. Even for the political radicalism that we now see is definitely no big deal because at least it’s not treason.

Whether or not the Russia scandal brings down this presidency and it might, the point of the Russia attack was to knock America down a few pegs in the eyes of the world. They win and we lose if the outcome of all of this — regardless of this presidency — is that we become a country that lets all this other stuff slide, right, we’re even rank corruption becomes normal or too small potatoes for us to worry about it. We cannot let ourselves be the American generation where the standard slipped that badly, right, where that happened. At some point, we’re going to have to get back to zero in terms of being able to be shocked by corruption, nepotism and crime in government. We’re going to have to get back to zero when it’s all done.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b258145c5:f88b47:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Alex Marlow read Dr. Sebastian Gorka a quote from a Washington Post article about Secretary of State Rex Tillerson: “Many career diplomats say they still have not met him, and some have been instructed not to speak to him directly or even make eye contact.” Gorka laughed and dismissed this assertion as “fake news.”

“The secretary has been doing sterling work at the meetings of principals and other similar gatherings. He has been working like an incredibly effective CEO, which is what he was. He is driven to represent the nation as our highest-ranking diplomat,” he said.

“It’s like the stories that have been broiling now for months and months and months. It’s the generation of those who are either inside the machine or outside the machine who do not wish to recognize what happened on November the 8 and think that they have some special right not only to generate false news, but to somehow question the legitimacy of a duly elected administration. It’s just absurdity, Alex,” said Gorka.

Dr. Sebastian Gorka is a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, former National Security editor for Breitbart News and author of books such as Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War.

Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

As women all over the world celebrated Women’s History Month this March, little attention focused on the number of women who form the backbone of President Trump’s National Security Council.

His two deputy national security advisers — K.T. McFarland (pictured above) and Dina Powell, and the person in charge of writing the national security strategy — Nadia Schadlow — are women.

It’s likely the first time that women have held those positions simultaneously — no insignificant fact in a field that’s still male-dominated.

Together, McFarland, Powell and Schadlow bring different strengths to the table.

McFarland is an experienced national security hand, starting at the NSC in 1970, as an 18-year-old college freshman.

“At that time, there were maybe two women who were research assistants, but to be a professional expert on the national security council as a woman, in that era, at the very beginning of the baby boom, that just wasn’t going to be an option for women,” she said.

“It wasn’t that we were discriminated against, it just wasn’t thought of.”

It was a momentous time — Richard Nixon was president, Henry Kissinger was national security adviser. The issues were the Vietnam War, Paris Peace Accords, opening to China, arms control with the Soviet Union, Middle East shuttle diplomacy. McFarland started at the NSC as the nightshift secretary and left in 1976 as a research assistant.

She later returned to government when Ronald Reagan became president, and was one of the highest ranking women at the Defense Department.

Her experience served her well for her first challenge on the job: Building an NSC from scratch, particularly since her then-boss, Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, had never worked in the White House before.

McFarland said she got the call from Trump on Thanksgiving night. Her first call was to her mentor, Kissinger. She then brought him and subsequent cabinet officials in to discuss their experiences.

“Since President Trump did not come into office having a long experience in foreign policy and national security, had never been in government before, had never been in office before, I thought it made a lot of sense for us to start at the beginning and look … at former national security advisers,” she said.

In the meantime, they were talking to Trump every day — he was already meeting and taking calls from foreign leaders.

“It was a heady time, it was an exhausting time,” McFarland recalls.

On January 20, she came into her new office. Her new desk was about 20 feet from where her first desk was, 47 years ago.

She placed a call to Kissinger, so the dispatcher could say, “Henry Kissinger, the White House is calling.”

“He was so moved and so touched,” she said.

McFarland said the first thing Trump asked her to do is look at North Korea.

She convened the deputies at the Departments of State, Defense, and Treasury, the Joint Chiefs, and from the intelligence community, and instructed them to come back in a few weeks with some ideas, and to “think outside the box.”

“Don’t just think about a little bit of sanctions, a little bit of diplomacy. Open it wide, and think of any creative ideas you can and come back to us. And so they did. And what I was very impressed with was they had thought outside the box on a lot of things, and so we were able to craft some really good options for the president on how to deal with North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and that’s the process he’s in now,” she said.

“We’ll do this for other issues as well — China, Russia, Venezuela, we’re going to look at the whole range of these issues for the president,” she added.

McFarland calls terrorism “the challenge of our day.”

She said while there were kamikaze attacks during World War II, today’s terrorists are targeting civilians, not military targets, and are “happy to die as long as they can bring others with them.”

“If you look at the history of warfare, people always wanted to survive,” she said. “This is a threat we’ve never seen before.”

Fellow Deputy National Security Adviser Powell brings to the table 10 years of working on Wall Street and a “get it done” mindset. She first came into the Trump administration as an assistant to the president and senior counselor for economic initiatives.

But it also made sense for Powell, an Egyptian-American who was born in Cairo, migrated to Texas when she was four, and worked in the former George W. Bush administration and Congress on defense issues, to expand her role to the foreign policy realm.

Powell, who wants to stay out of the spotlight, is working closely with McFarland and Schadlow to help build out the national security strategy. She particularly believes in the economic empowerment of women, particularly in the Middle East.

Coming from one male-dominated career field to another, she believes that talent will carry one through — whether it’s from a male or female.

Still, she recognizes that it can be hard for women to be confident in areas where there might not be a lot of other women, and that sometimes there have to be role models to pave the way.

Hers were former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX).

Schadlow, in addition to experience in government as a presidential management fellow, brings to the table experience in thinking deeply about long-term national security planning.

Her first assignment in government was at the Department of the Army, where she was first exposed to the military.

She later became the Pentagon’s first desk officer for Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union, a job that is the equivalent of country director today.

Wanting more career mobility, she left the government for the Smith-Richardson Foundation, where she researched emerging national security threats — which she said was great preparation for her current role.

Her role models include Marin Strmecki, senior vice president at the Smith-Richardson Foundation, but also her mother, who migrated from Italy to give her three daughters more opportunity, and encouraged them to be independent.

Supporting McFarland, Powell and Schadlow is another echelon of accomplished women, such as Victoria Coates, senior director for strategic assessments at the NSC.

Coates (pictured right) is a protégé of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Gov. Rick Perry (R-TX) and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. She last served as Cruz’s senior national security adviser.

She has a Ph.D. in art history, and recently published a book on the history of democracy.

Her role models were her mother, who is a chief compliance officer at a large firm, and Rumsfeld. She also credits McFarland with being a great friend and mentor.

A typical day for them involves lots and lots of meetings.

McFarland said a typical day involves getting up at 5 a.m., getting into office by 7 a.m. and receiving an intelligence briefing of major developments. Some days, she has an additional briefing on specific topics.

Around 10 a.m., she usually goes in to see the president with her now-boss Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the CIA Director and other national security officials for the president’s daily briefing.

“Then the rest of the day, I’m chairing meetings, I’m meeting with people on the NSC staff in the intelligence community, members of the White House staff, and then my day usually goes until seven or eight or nine o’clock at night,” she said.

On one recent day, there were meetings ranging from Montenegro, Kurdish independence, to North Korea.

The job is not particularly family friendly. The main obstacle? Classification issues.

Much of the work can only be done in a secure environment inside the White House. That means mom has to live and work in Washington, D.C.

McFarland’s five children are grown, but Powell, Schadlow and Coates all have young children who live at home outside of D.C.

“You’re still not ever going to have it all — it’s impossible,” said Schadlow, who has three children.

“I wished many times that I was a little more engaged with what my kids were learning in school, and I had the time to do a deep dive and just be part of that intellectual life that they’re experiencing, and in some ways I can’t do it day-to-day, especially now,” she said.

She said while there are more services for working mothers these days, it’s still a challenge.

“Of course there are tradeoffs. My house is always a wreck,” she laughs. “It’s real. It’s a constant balance.”

Coates, who has a 15-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son, says it makes the time spent together more special.

“I went to spring training with my son. We had 36 hours together… but they were 36 really good hours,” she said.

Schadlow said as difficult as it is to be away from family, it can also be a luxury just to focus on work.

“When you’re at home as a working mom, you’re constantly multitasking all day long, managing everyone’s schedules. A lot defaults to the mom, I think, still,” she said. “And here — no cell phones in your office, no way to communicate really day-to-day in the office. It’s really all about your work.”

“I’m so happy to have the opportunity. It’s a luxury to jump in and focus on one thing for awhile, and knowing that everyone at home has sort of agreed to just take care the day-to-day,” she said.

At the NSC, the women say they’ve found no difference in treatment due to their gender.

McFarland calls Trump an “equal opportunity guy.”

“President Trump is an equal opportunity guy in the sense of, I’m in a room, and as I said, I’m in the president’s daily briefing in the morning, and sometimes there’s only one woman in the room, and sometimes the vice president’s national security adviser — also a woman, Col. Andrea Thompson, is there, and the president will look at us and expect us to answer the tough questions just as readily as anybody else,” she said.

“In fact sometimes when the really tough questions come, I look around at my male colleagues who are afraid to say something, and I’m the first one to jump in and say, ‘Well you could think of it this way, Mr. President.’ And often the only other person who jumps right in with me is the other woman,” she said.

Her advice to women in any career field?

“Don’t settle. Don’t settle for second best. And don’t quit, and don’t give up.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b24dbbc1d:f8a791:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON—As senators prepare to vote on the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday highlighted several key facts to the public to inform the nationwide discussion as the Senate increasingly appears headed to a historic outcome one way or the other.

In all of American history, there has never been a successful partisan filibuster from either party of a Supreme Court nominee. The first such attempted filibuster was Justice Samuel Alito in 2006, led by Senate Democrats.

Even then, when Neil Gorsuch went before the Senate in that same year for confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, he was confirmed by a unanimous voice vote without a single dissenting senator. Democratic senators who are leading the charge against Gorsuch now, such a Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy, did not object a decade ago. Several senators from red states who are up for reelection in 2018 were also in the Senate in 2006, such as Bill Nelson and Debbie Stabenow.

When insisting that President George W. Bush must use American Bar Association (ABA) ratings as part of his judicial vetting process, Schumer and Leahy referred to the ABA rating as the “gold standard” for judicial nominees. The ABA recently gave Gorsuch a unanimous “well-qualified” rating for the Supreme Court, which is its highest rating.

Although Schumer recently said that “after careful deliberation” he has decided to oppose Gorsuch, before Gorsuch was named, Schumer told two media outlets that he intended to block whoever President Trump would nominate: first was Rachel Maddow on January 3, and then CNN’s State of the Union on January 22.

Finally, the Washington Post (hardly a rightwing bastion) gave Schumer “Two Pinnochios” for saying there is a 60-vote standard for Supreme Court nominations. The Post noted that two of the current nine justices were confirmed with less than 60 votes. (Alito received 58, and Justice Clarence Thomas was confirmed with 52.)

An American pastor held in a Turkish jail since October of last year for “membership in an armed terrorist organization” has reached out to the U.S. Embassy in that country hoping to communicate his plight to President Donald Trump, according to the American Center for Law and Justice.

On Tuesday, Rev. Andrew Brunson gave the U.S. Embassy in Turkey a statement he hopes will reach the president’s desk.

Will the Turkish government face no consequence for stubbornly continuing to hold an American citizen as a political prisoner? Even though I have a long public track record as a church pastor, they falsely accuse me of being a member of an Islamist terrorist group. I have been imprisoned since October 7, 2016. During this time the Turkish government has produced no proof and has rebuffed numerous attempts by the American government to secure my return to the United States. In fact they are treating the U.S. government with contempt and paying no price for it. I plead with my government – with the Trump Administration – to fight for me. I ask the State Department to impose sanctions. I appeal to President Trump: please help me. Let the Turkish government know that you will not cooperate with them in any way until they release me. Please do not leave me here in prison.

Brunson, a U.S. citizen from Black Mountain, North Carolina, has worked as a Christian missionary in Turkey for the past 23 years.

The ACLJ told his story on its website after his arrest in October and launched a petition drive that has gathered more than 240,000 signatures.

Pastor Andrew Brunson – a U.S. citizen from Black Mountain, North Carolina – was summoned to the local police station in Izmir, Turkey on the morning of October 7, 2016. He believed he would be receiving a long awaited permanent residence card. Pastor Brunson, who is a U.S. citizen, has been living in Turkey for 23 years, running a Christian church with the full knowledge of local authorities. Upon arriving at the station, he was informed he was being deported based on being a “threat to national security,” a common excuse for deportation in Turkey. It became clear that he was being arrested and would be detained until deportation. He was fingerprinted, searched, and had his phone, pen, etc. taken away. He was denied a Bible. But instead of being deported, he was held with no charges for 63 days, during which time he was denied access to his Turkish attorney. He was placed in solitary confinement for part of this time, with his glasses and watch confiscated. Then on December 8th, after being detained for 63 days, things took a dire turn. In the middle of the night, Pastor Andrew was taken to a counter terrorism center in Izmir and then on to court. He was questioned and has been falsely charged with “membership in an armed terrorist organization.” The charging documents state no “evidence has been gathered” against him. A Turkish judge had the option to deport Pastor Andrew, release him on weekly sign-ins at the local police station, or imprison him. The judge chose to remand Pastor Andrew to prison.”

Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) traveled to the Turkish capital Ankara in December where he met with the department of justice officials, Fox News reported.

“For the first time, we learned what these charges are,” Lankford told Fox News. “They were given to me orally.”

Lankford told Fox News that the Turkish authorities alleged Brunson had helped Kurdish refugees — Turkey labels the Kurds an insurgent group — and that the pastor attended a conference put on by Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, whom the Turkish government accused of plotting the 2016 coup from Pennsylvania where he now lives.

“We really, really want to get this case, my father’s case, to President Trump,” Brunson’s daughter Jacqueline Brunson told Fox News this month. “We really feel it would be helpful to have the president’s support and have him personally arguing for my father’s case to get him back home safely to his family.”

The college student told WTVD-TV she’s has been forced to put off her wedding plans, Faithwire.com reported.

“That’s kind of on hold because I want my dad to be able to walk me down the aisle,” she said. “I want him there. He only gets to see me get married once.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2488ebe4:ef583b:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In the mere weeks since taking office, President Trump has faced unprecedented and targeted illegal leaks at the highest level of government. There is a highly orchestrated shadow government undermining his every move. The players are out in force and the plan is clear.

This is not whistleblowing by any stretch. It is sabotage. And it is highly coordinated and includes Hillary Clinton, whose sights are firmly set on 2020. Let us recall she wanted nothing more than to run against Donald Trump. A political neophyte who had never held elected office and a reality TV star to boot, he was her dream opponent. An “easy-peasy” win, a favored term of Hillary’s. In fact, leaked emails reported by Breitbart show the Hillary Campaign coordinating with the DNC to elevate this “pied piper” candidate rationalizing he would be the least palatable to the electorate. This walk-in-the-park scenario was her guaranteed ticket to the White House. Finally. In the annals of American history, it will go down as the greatest of grand underestimations.

Hillary will use whatever means necessary to achieve her goal. To that end, and in an unprecedented fashion, she and her cohorts work tirelessly behind the scenes in a highly coordinated effort to delegitimize this president. And it began bright and early in the morning hours of November 9th.

She is not working alone. With the help of thousands of imbedded Obama supporters who occupy federal civil service positions and dogged obstructionists in Congress, a clear pattern emerges. As always, they have the eager help of the mainstream media.

Hillary may have licked her wounds for a short time following her historic defeat, but she has not been idle. Now she is “coming out of the woods”, a veiled reference to her post defeat meeting with a young woman in the woods near her home. It soon became clear it was all contrived, a great photo op to remind us of all things Hillary. An upbeat photo op of a real trooper designed to belie the orchestrated backroom activities.

In an attempt to remain relevant, she schedules speeches across the land. The “Queen of Resist and Persist” is readying herself for 2020. That the democrats might not be inclined to back her is of little concern to her and rightfully so. After all, they installed Nancy Pelosi once again, despite the shellacking her leadership earned. Democrats have not learned a thing from the voters. From Hillary’s age old perspective, the voters exist to be manipulated and she is confident that this time it will work. She has a plan.

As Hillary eyes 2020, she does so with confidence. Again she is underestimating President Trump, and as always, she underestimates American voters. Seen as little more than a fluke, she believes the machinations afoot to undermine him will result in a failed presidency if not impeachment, ensuring smooth sailing to a victory that was always her for the taking.

Many believe she has the help of former President Obama, who himself campaigned vigorously for her, claiming candidate Trump was dangerous and unfit, even staking his own presidential legacy and reputation on her victory The writing was on the wall, and as we learn more about his interest in undermining Trump, it will likely become clear how determined this man actually was.

There is so much that is positively historic about this election and its aftermath. It appears that massive and unprecedented leaks are occurring on a virtually daily basis. Now we are to believe “they” happened to tap the President-Elect and members of his transition team in an “oops” moment, but at the same time found a new way to have that surveillance information disseminated throughout the intelligence community. That had never happened before. After eight years in office but just days before his exit, President Obama took the unusual step of ensuring this was not only possible, but legal. The man had a plan.

There is no “incidentally” in high powered surveillance. There is no “incidental” at the presidential level. Period. And at no time would individuals be unmasked. I believe the “incidental” was the target, and “incidental” was the cover. This had to be approved at the very highest levels of government.

Then there are the unprecedented massive illegal leaks which on a daily basis allow the mainstream media to spin their wheels about every manner of alleged malfeasance with nothing but anonymous leaks and sources to back their stories. It is all of a piece, all designed to delegitimize, in fact paralyze this presidency. There will never be a paper trail. It will be virtually impossible to prove. The media by and large are imbedded participants in this nefarious operation. But it is an organized attack and it is headed by the highest of the high. How do I know this?

In 1998 when Hillary was documented to have said “Get me anything and everything on Linda Tripp”, she meant it. Two political hacks at the Pentagon were more than happy, in fact eager, to oblige. They broke the law, releasing Privacy Act protected information, and in doing so, cemented public perception of my new villain status. I knew both these lackeys well. They were foot soldiers for the White House. They would never have broken the law without a direct order from the White House. That none of it was true was irrelevant. That I had been completely truthful mattered not at all. That I had never broken the law in my life mattered not at all. Blatantly illegal, but it got the job done. The villain in the sordid presidential saga was not Bill Clinton. It was Linda Tripp.

I sued and won. But it was a hollow victory. There was no getting my good name back. And there was no personal punishment for those who broke the law. I was awarded half a million dollars from the government in a lawsuit that went on for years, ultimately proving the orchestrated malfeasance on the part of those in power.

But this settlement was a small price to pay to completely change the dialogue. It created a new villain out of whole cloth and ensured then President Clinton was seen as the merely adulterous and hapless victim of evil perpetrators, not the cruel serial abuser of women or the menacing and quite powerful obstructer of justice he most certainly was. Their reach was significant, even ensuring my case was reassigned from a sympathetic judge to a Clinton appointed judge. In the hands of yet another FOB, it ensured my anticipated win would not amount to much. Job well done.

It is all happening again today, but on an astronomically more elevated scale. Now many imbedded Obama people all across the government, but most specifically in the Intelligence Community, are doing everything in their power to undermine President Trump. Their goal is to incapacitate him. Unprecedented leaks, fake news and accusations litter the airwaves, the mainstream media just as complicit now as they were proven to be during the campaign.

Once again it changes the dialogue and puts the focus precisely where Hillary wants it to be. She can only do this with the committed assistance of the press. As in 1998, members of the press don’t see their job as reporting the news, but unabashedly making the news. Fake or otherwise, it matters not at all. With such a concerted effort , this administration will spend a great deal of time batting down the ridiculous attacks leaving them with significantly less time to focus on the people’s agenda. And that is precisely the point.

There will be investigation upon investigation. Political hacks will lie, others will swear to it. Nothing will ever be definitively proven, but the damage will be done. It is the old “where there is smoke, there is fire” routine, the piling on ensuring that at best this administration is seen as questionable, at worst as lawbreakers worthy of removal. Our lady in waiting, Hillary Clinton, pictures herself poised to rescue the country from this dangerous man.

Nineteen years ago, I had no voice. Objecting to their powerful portrayal of me as a villain was hopelessly futile, akin to protesting in an enormous vacuum. Effectively silenced by those in power, I soon understood the impossibility for a private citizen to be heard above as powerful an entity as the White House. The mighty voices of the Clintons and the mainstream media were deafening, a runaway train plowing down anyone in its way. It resonated all across the land.

It does not have to be that way this time.

If he continues to take his case directly to the American people, President Trump can defeat the powerful conjoined forces that would destroy his presidency. And make no mistake, this is their goal.

The illegal leakers must be rooted out and fired. In government, everyone spies on everyone else, so this can be done. These people have committed felonies and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Those who incidentally spied on the Trump transition should be held to account. And as to the Fourth Estate, many more outlets exist than giants such as NBC, CNN, ABC, CBS or the Washington Post and the New York Times. He owes these outlets nothing but the routine White House access to which they are entitled.

Continued outreach to alternative and local news outlets and regular forays into the country to address large groups of Americans will allow his agenda to “trump” the media who seek to destroy him. He can quite literally eradicate the nasty filter of those who have proven their allegiance not to the truth, but to a partisan agenda. It will render them irrelevant.

Many members of the media obsess on “the Russians” to the exclusion of virtually anything else. They want, in fact need, a Russia-Trump connection and if there is not one, they will invent one. Recall if you can what level of coverage existed about the questionable deal that sold about 20% of our Uranium to Russia while she was Secretary of State. Or those same uranium investors who then funneled $145,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Or about the $500,000 speech Bill Clinton gave in Moscow. Recall how much interest was shown when it was learned that members of her presidential campaign met “with the Russians”. None of this speaks to the media point of view so it is swept under the rug. If they don’t report it, it didn’t happen. But this is only one prong of the full frontal attack.

The imbedded Obama careerists are sabotaging their own President for political gain. The incidental spying is strongly related as well. The behind the scenes machinations coordinated by Hillary play a large part in achieving her ultimate goal. Her rise, his fall.

Taken together, it is frighteningly reminiscent of the Soviet Union. The nefarious and widely orchestrated campaign against the President by members of his own government is straight out of a Soviet spy novel. As is the KGB-like surveillance of a political opponent, incidental or otherwise in our country. And history reminds us of the Mother of all Fake news, their massive propaganda machine. It ensured news was what they chose it to be, literally defining Soviet Russia for so many years. We are perilously close to that today. In America. President Trump has a voice. He must never stop using it.

Linda Tripp worked in both the Bill Clinton administration and the George H.W. Bush White House. Under Bush, she served as executive assistant to the deputy chief of staff to the president. During the Clinton administration, she first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside the Oval Office. After three months, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster asked Tripp to work for the White House Counsel’s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons in their infamous scandals.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b246d6e53:ec0b5c:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Comedy Central will apparently launch a new television show called The President Show, according to a press release from the cable network released Thursday that mocked President Trump’s tweeting style.

“Late night TV is broken. A TOTAL DISASTER. I alone can fix it!” the official Comedy Central press release touted.

The press release included a Twitter handle — @PresidentShow — but included no additional information about the project.

The President Show Twitter handle boasts that it is the “#1 show on television,” with “many many millions of viewers.”

A separate Twitter handle — @LateNightDonald — has also apparently been created in conjunction with the upcoming series. The handle’s bio reads: “Official Twitter profile for the host of @PresidentShow. Make Night Late Again!”

The “Late Night Donald” account began issuing tweets last week, many of which poke fun at the president.

Can’t wait for #GameOfThrones to come back. Love watching the Lannisters beat up on those LOSER Starks. — Late Night Donald (@LateNightDonald) March 30, 2017

The President Show could be the Viacom-owned cable network’s replacement for The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which was canceled in August after two years of perpetually low ratings.

The Funny or Die-produced, game show-formatted @midnight with Chris Hardwick has been airing in the 11:30 p.m. slot left vacant by Wilmore, immediately following Trevor Noah’s Daily Show.

TV Guide notes that the mysterious project could simply be a Daily Show special, or could be related to Trevor Noah’s planned “Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library,” a library set to open in June in Manhattan that will feature a collection of the president’s “most important and insane tweets.”

A representative for Comedy Central said the network had “no further information at this time.”

A bill to tax illegal immigrants to fund the construction of President Donald Trump’s border wall was introduced by Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL).

The legislation known as the “Border Wall Funding Act of 2017” would impose a 2 percent tax on all remittances going back to Mexico from illegal and some legal immigrants living in the U.S. to pay for the estimated $12 billion border wall.

“President Trump has made it very clear that he intends to complete a wall along our Southern border,” Rogers said in a news release. “As a senior member of the Homeland Security committee, I have long supported the border wall, which will protect Americans.”

As the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) has noted in the past, an estimated $54.2 billion is sent back to the home countries of illegal and legal immigrants living in the U.S. In 2014 alone, $24 billion was sent from the U.S. to Mexico in remittances, leaving that money entirely lost on the U.S. economy.

Meanwhile, South and Central American countries like Guatemala and El Salvador took in more than 15 percent of their overall growth domestic products (GDPs) in remittances from illegal and legal immigrants in the U.S.

Rogers said his legislation is “simple,” saying in a statement that “anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall.”

“This bill keeps money in the American economy, and most importantly, it creates a funding stream to build the wall,” Rogers said.

Immigration hawks have long supported a tax on remittances, which is something Trump first brought up on the 2016 presidential campaign trail.

The Federation for American Immigration (FAIR) is publicly supporting Rogers’ border wall funding plan, with spokesperson Cassie Williams telling Breitbart Texas in a statement that it would not cost the American taxpayer a dime.

“Congressman Rogers’ bill should be supported on both sides of the aisle because it will help reduce illegal immigration and save American jobs at no cost to taxpayers,” Williams said.

Experts like David North with Center for Immigration Studies has long argued for a remittance tax.

“This is something that actually could be done, and it would bring a billion dollars a year into the Treasury while setting up a series of records that state and federal tax officials could use to collect the income taxes that should be paid by illegal aliens and other remittance senders,” North wrote back in April 2016.

While it is likely the Trump Administration would support Rogers’ border wall funding plan, the White House is also weighing the option of cutting domestic spending as well, according to documents obtained by ABC News. For instance, $1.2 billion in grant money through the National Institutes of Health would be stripped to help pay for the wall, as well as $1.5 billion in community development block grants.

Thursday at her weekly press briefing Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called President Donald Trump executive order to roll back President Obama’s climate actions and power plant emissions rules, “sinful.”

Pelosi said, “Clean power plant, shocking, almost sinful, really sinful to be so degrading of God’s creation. The administration’s attack on science and the clean power plant will not bring back jobs to coal country. It will only poison our air and undermine Americans ability to win good paying clean jobs of the future.”

President Donald Trump’s former national security advisor, Ret. Gen. Mike Flynn, has reportedly offered his testimony in the investigation into Russian ties to the president in exchange for immunity, a report says.

Flynn has reportedly asked for immunity should his testimony lead to any finding of wrong doing, according to a Thursday report by the Wall Street Journal.

The Journal claims that Flynn, a retired army general, and Trump campaign adviser, made his offer to the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees through his lawyer. Officials have not yet accepted the deal, the paper says.

Details of what Flynn might be willing to say to investigators have not been made public.

Flynn was appointed as then President-Elect Trump’s national security advisor in November of last year but resigned by February after revelations emerged that he had opened communications with Russian officials, communications about which he neglected to fully brief the vice president.

In his resignation letter, Flynn apologized for neglecting to fully inform VP Pence about the discussions he had with the Russian ambassador saying the omission was due to the “fast pace of events.”

At the time of the resignation, Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the administration let Flynn go not due to any legal issues but due to “a trust issue.” Spicer said that the “level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.”

Flynn is facing pressure from several inquiries into his dealings with Russian officials which include thousands he was paid by a trio of Russian companies for speeches made before he joined Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, as well as his communications with the Russian ambassador.

Flynn’s offer to testify comes as Democrats continue to press for investigations into ties Trump may have had with Russia. To date there has been no direct ties proven between Trump or his campaign for president and Russia.

Partial transcript as follows:

KORNACKI: An announcement by a Democrat — I know he’s one of the more moderate or conservative Democrats — but an announcement by a Democrat Joe Manchin that’s going to vote for this confirmation. What does this do, Howard Dean, to the question of a filibuster on the Democratic side?

DEAN: Nothing. That’s baked n. I expect two or three or four Democrats to vote for Judge Gorsuch. That is what their constituency wants. I can tell you right now if Judge Gorsuch if he’s confirmed by Democrats — that is unless we force McConnell to exercise the nuclear option —if he’s confirmed straight up with 60 votes, 10 of which are Democratic, the Democratic Senatorial committee might as well hang it up ’cause they’ll never raise any money from our base.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b21bc815b:9d7c41:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

During a speech at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden argued that in 2016, the Democratic Party “did not talk what it always stood for, and that is how to maintain a burgeoning middle class.”

Biden stated that he thinks the choice between protecting American jobs and engaging with the world is “exaggerated.” He added, “Look, in a sense, we wouldn’t be having this conversation about American jobs, in the way it’s just been phrased, legitimately, by the president, were it not for 171,000 votes, 171,000 votes in four states, that put us in this position.”

Biden continued that 2016 was the first campaign he could remember “where, my party did not talk what it always stood for, and that is how to maintain a burgeoning middle class. And the truth of the matter is, you didn’t hear a single solitary sentence in the last campaign about that guy working on the assembly making $60,000 a year, and the wife making $32,000 as a hostess in a restaurant…and they’ve got two kids, and they can’t make it, and they’re scared, and they’re frightened.” He further stated that while on the macro level, globalization has been a phenomenal success, but it has “left people behind.” And the global system is something the US needs more than anyone in the world.

Biden later said, “[Y]ou know, all those angry white men, you know, we talk about, that are racist. Guess what? Barack and I won them. Let’s get this straight. It wasn’t racist. They voted for a black man, twice in a row, but they didn’t this time. They didn’t this time, because they look out there, and they’re scared and no one’s talking to them.”

He also stated President Trump “has not created any jobs. He’s not going to create many jobs.” He also argued that it’s a “false choice” to try and decide between focusing on the white working class and being progressive.

It sure ain’t pretty, but this is what “post-partisan” politics looks like. And despite all the caterwauling you hear from the political press here in Washington, that is a good thing.

“Ryancare” or “Trumpcare,” or whatever the hell you want to call it, is dead.

This is not some kind of mark of Satan on President Trump’s forehead. Nor is it evidence that the conservative House “Freedom Caucus” should be booted from the Republican Party. It doesn’t even mean House Speaker Paul D. Ryan should be defenestrated from his fourth floor office window on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol.

All the failure of this bill means — once you mute all the hot blather and red-faced hyperventilating around here — is that this specific repeal-and-replace bill was not appealing enough to get the necessary votes to pass the U.S. House of Representatives.

And that is probably a good thing for America.

After all, the bill was, indeed, “Obamacare Lite.” Certainly there were some very smart provisions in the bill that would have “bent the curve” of the insane long-term overspending of government welfare.

But at the end of the day, the bill mainly just replaced a massive and reckless new federal government entitlement program built by Democrats with a massive and reckless new federal government entitlement program built by Republicans.

Either one of these federal health care Ponzi schemes would have hastened the bankruptcy of America. And the only thing that would come of either one is a bunch of politicians patting themselves on the back, feeling virtuous and proclaiming to the world how generous they are about giving other people’s money to the poor.

Yeah, real sainthood material there.

Instead — in this era of post-partisanship — Republicans cast their votes based on the interests of their constituents, not their party leaders. And, of course, the GOP bill failed.

Had such a bill come up during the “honeymoon” of George W. Bush’s first term in office, Republican leaders in the House would have cracked the whip and jammed it through.

Had it come up during the “honeymoon” of Barack Obama’s first term in office — whose entire 2008 campaign promised a new, post-partisan world — Democrats would have cracked the whip and jammed it through. That is, of course, exactly how Obamacare passed in the first place. Remember? You have to pass the bill before you can see what is in the bill?

So why is everybody around here going absolutely berserk over the demise of the GOP’s repeal-and-replace plan? Is it really because all of these people wanted to see Obamacare repealed and replaced?

No. The only reason all these people are freaking out right now is because they are desperate to blame Trump and Republicans for everything that goes wrong. Specifically, they are desperate to draw attention from the real rumbling political disaster here, which is Obamacare itself. And that bureaucratic monstrosity is only getting worse and affects actual voters.

People around here who are obsessed with political theater are happy to blame Trump and Republicans. So far the only people blamed for the failure of the GOP bill have been those conservative Republicans in Congress who served their constituents rather than their party leaders.

But the real culprits here are the hotly partisan Democrats in Congress who jammed through Obamacare in the first place and then sit around on their hands now as Trump and Republicans try to fix it.

The 2018 elections cannot come soon enough!</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b21bc815b:9d7c3e:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Thursday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh dismissed the possibility of President Donald Trump working alongside Democrats as “fantasy.”

Limbaugh said this fantasy would come to an end when Democrats filibuster the Supreme Court confirmation vote of Judge Neil Gorsuch likely to happen next month, which Limbaugh said will be done out of a necessity for Democrats to fundraise.

Transcript as follows (courtesy of Rushlimbaugh.com):

Now, folks, I did not mean to cause any undue concern here. Let me close the loop, dot the I’s and cross the T’s. This fantasy of working with the Democrats, and the New York Times clearly is hot and bothered. The New York Times, when you read this editorial, they’re clearly in the advanced stages of foreplay. They’re on the verge, they think that it’s gonna happen. I’m gonna tell you, they’re gonna have a cold shower, everybody is.

This fantasy of working with the Democrats is gonna be put to bed on April 7th or whenever the Senate votes on Gorsuch and the Democrats filibuster it. ‘Cause I don’t care what the Freedom Caucus has done, when it comes down to Gorsuch, the Democrats are not gonna vote for the guy. If they have to, they’ll filibuster him. The name of the game is resistance. That’s how the Democrats keep their donations coming in. It’s how the DNC is gonna be reconstituted, resistance, resistance, oppose. Hillary was out there talking about it in San Francisco in the black leather jacket. You think that was an accidental wardrobe choice? Ha. Hardly.

So Trump’s gonna get angry all over again at the Democrats when they filibuster Gorsuch. I was watching Lindsey Grahamnesty on TV today. Lindsey Grahamnesty is a guy, the last thing in the world that he would ever want to do is pull the nuclear option. Preserve the Senate rules. But he was loaded for bear today talking about the Democrats. He said (paraphrasing), “If they can’t vote for Neil Gorsuch, then it’s clear there’s not a single judge any Republican would ever nominate they would vote for.” I’m sitting there saying, are you just now figuring this out? But I’ll take it, if he’s just now figuring it out.

So they’re gonna filibuster Gorsuch. Did you hear what Pelosi said about Gorsuch? I know you guys, I know you get tired of me sometimes being repetitive, but I’m telling you, I only repeat what they say. Did you hear what Pelosi said about Gorsuch? I’m paraphrasing, it’s pretty close. “If you drink water and breathe air, you need to oppose Neil Gorsuch.” I know. I know. The Republicans are blamed for all this pollution out there. And you don’t think anybody takes it seriously.

The question is, why is Nancy Pelosi not laughed and hooted out of politics with a comment like that? Why does anybody give her any credence whatsoever? And yet the media and Democrat analysts talk about that, “She’s brilliant. That’s a brilliant strategy, to blame the guy for dirty water and dirty air.” It’s akin to Republicans want to destroy the planet. Why do Republicans want to destroy where they live? But the Democrats live and die with this stuff. She uses it because it still works, is the problem, and it works with the lunatics that send her money and vote for her.

Imagine, if you like drinking water — it’s not a matter of like; you have to do that. And if you like breathing, Neil Gorsuch is not your judge, as though Gorsuch is gonna try to stop you from drinking water, breathing air, or poison it. It’s just absurd.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b21bc815b:9d7c3d:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A California company fighting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in court has written to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to complain that Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers are still pursuing a case after President Donald Trump’s recent executive order on water policy removed the basis for the lawsuit.

The company, formerly known as Greka Oil &amp; Gas Inc., and now called HVI Cat Canyon Inc. (HVI-CC), was sued several years ago over alleged oil spills near its tar leases in the state.

Unlike most companies, HVI-CC fought back, and the results have been embarrassing for the government. At one point, state officials were found to have destroyed potentially exculpatory evidence. Later, it emerged that an EPA official had allegedly threatened company executives with being raped in prison.

Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order reviewing, with a view to reversing, the EPA’s “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule, which was promulgated under President Barack Obama. WOTUS expanded the interpretation of the Clean Water Act so to include not only “navigable” waters, but also waters with a “significant nexus” with navigable waters, meaning that the EPA had virtually limitless regulatory authority over water — even, critics charged, over rain puddles on private farmland. Earlier this month, the EPA began to implement the order by preparing for new water rules.

The case against HVI-CC rests partly on the claim that the company discharged oil into dry ditches on private property that rarely fill with rainwater. The company’s lawyers, from the Larson O’Brien firm, complained in a letter to Sessions dated March 21, and provided to Breitbart News, that DOJ lawyers are continuing the case even though “the President’s recent Executive Order expressly disavows the legal arguments it is based on.”

HVI-CC’s lawyers asked the Attorney General to “put an end to the resistance to and obstruction of President Trump’s Executive Order by dismissing this case over which the United States has no jurisdiction,” or at least to “suspend the prosecution of the case until the EPA and the Corps complete the review and rulemaking initiated by the Executive Order.”

In a response to Larson O’Brien dated March 28, the DOJ stated that the case would be continuing, at the direction of “management,” and that the position of the government on the litigation had not changed “at this time.”

The DOJ declined to comment for this article.

A source involved in the case speculated to Breitbart News that the reluctance of the DOJ to drop the litigation was further evidence of the existence of a “deep state” effort by career bureaucrats or Obama-era appointees to undermine President Trump and his new policies.

On Thursday, suspicions arose that a EPA press release criticizing President Trump may have been the result of rivalries between agency officials and Trump administration appointees.

Earlier this month, Adam Kredo of the Washington Free Beacon reported that “senior government officials who previously worked under President Obama and remain loyal to his agenda” are opposing Trump from within by altering official communications, counter-acting his directives and selectively leaking to media sources.

The Hill connects ongoing conflict among staff at the Environmental Protection Agency to a press release on President Trump’s executive order on energy independence Tuesday that included a quote slamming the president’s new policy.

The press release included a quote, mistakenly attributed to Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), “With this Executive Order, President Trump has chosen to recklessly bury his head in the sand. Walking away from the Clean Power Plan and other climate initiatives, including critical resiliency projects is not just irresponsible — it’s irrational … Today’s executive order calls into question America’s credibility and our commitment to tackling the greatest environmental challenge of our lifetime.”

In fact, the Hill notes, that statement was made by Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE).

The Hill cites the “rift between many of the EPA’s nonpolitical career employees and the political leaders appointed by Trump” in connection with the press release.

EPA staff reportedly said they had mistakenly released a draft of the statement. However, the agency did not explain why an attack on the president would have been included in any draft of any release.

Last week, the Washington Free Beacon’s Adam Kredo reported an ongoing effort by Obama loyalists to sabotage the Trump administration by, among other methods, altering press releases.

“[H]oldovers from the Obama administration are working to undermine the Trump administration’s agenda through efforts to alter official communications, a number of administration officials confirmed in conversations with the Washington Free Beacon,” Kredo reported.

TEL AVIV — The controversial, largely discredited 35-page dossier on President Donald Trump compiled by a former British intelligence officer served as a “roadmap” for the FBI’s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump’s presidential campaign, the BBC reported on Wednesday.

The dossier, which contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed, was compiled by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans to investigate Trump.

Mike Morell, who served as deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency and twice as acting director, has questioned the dossier’s credibility as have news media reports worldwide.

“The roadmap for the investigation, publicly acknowledged now for the first time, comes from Christopher Steele, once of Britain’s secret intelligence service MI6,” the BBC’s Paul Wood reported.

Wood acknowledged that until now “no single piece of evidence has been made public proving that the Trump campaign joined with Russia to steal the US presidency – nothing.”

But he wrote that “the FBI Director, James Comey, told a hushed committee room in Congress last week that this is precisely what his agents are investigating.”

Wood related that Steele’s dossier “contains a number of highly contested claims.”

But one of the claims in the controversial document was purportedly verified by Wood – that Mikhail Kalugin, a Russian diplomat pulled out of Washington by Moscow, was a Russian agent.

Wood relates that “sources I know and trust have told me the US government identified Kalugin as a spy while he was still at the embassy.”

Of course, in the diplomatic world it is widely known that many top foreign diplomats report back to their home countries about information gleaned in the host country.

Spelling Kalugin’s name wrong, Steele at one point claimed: “A leading Russian diplomat, Mikhail KULAGIN, had been withdrawn from Washington at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement in the US presidential election operation… would be exposed in the media there.”

The FBI is not alone in relying on Steele. Earlier this month, Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on a House intelligence committee, cited Steele as a source repeatedly when he delivered his opening statements at a hearing where he laid out the case for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

The Washington Post reported that after being paid to compile opposition research on Trump by the billionaire’s opponents during the election, Steele “reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work, according to several people familiar with the arrangement.”

Ultimately, the FBI did not pay, Steele, the Post reported.

The Post report continued:

Communications between the bureau and the former spy were interrupted as Steele’s now-famous dossier became the subject of news stories, congressional inquiries and presidential denials, according to the people familiar with the arrangement, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.

In light of the Post report, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley earlier this month sent a letter requesting information on whether the FBI utilized Steele.

In the letter, Grassley questioned the FBI’s intentions over the Steele report:

The idea that the FBI and associates of the Clinton campaign would pay Mr. Steele to investigate the Republican nominee for President in the run-up to the election raises further questions about the FBI’s independence from politics, as well as the Obama administration’s use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends.

Citing current and former government officials, the New Yorker reported the dossier prompted skepticism among intelligence community member, with the publication quoting one member as saying it was a “nutty” piece of evidence to submit to a U.S. president.

Steele’s work has been questioned by former acting CIA director Morell, who currently works at the Hillary Clinton-tied Beacon Global Strategies LLC. Beacon was founded by Phillippe Reines, who served as Communications Adviser to Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state. From 2009-2013, Reines also served in Clinton’s State Department as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications. Reines is the managing director of Beacon.

NBC News reported on Morell’s questions about Steele’s credibility:

Morell, who was in line to become CIA director if Clinton won, said he had seen no evidence that Trump associates cooperated with Russians. He also raised questions about the dossier written by a former British intelligence officer, which alleged a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. … Morell pointed out that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on Meet the Press on March 5 that he had seen no evidence of a conspiracy when he left office January 20. “That’s a pretty strong statement by General Clapper,” Morell said.

Regarding Steele’s dossier, Morell stated, “Unless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can’t judge the information — you just can’t.”

Morell charged the dossier “doesn’t take you anywhere, I don’t think.”

“I had two questions when I first read it. One was, How did Chris talk to these sources? I have subsequently learned that he used intermediaries.”

Morell continued:

And then I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their motivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources and the intermediaries got the money from Chris. And that kind of worries me a little bit because if you’re paying somebody, particularly former FSB officers, they are going to tell you truth and innuendo and rumor, and they’re going to call you up and say, “Hey, let’s have another meeting, I have more information for you,” because they want to get paid some more. I think you’ve got to take all that into consideration when you consider the dossier.

A large billboard on Vine Street in Hollywood depicting Netflix’s Grace and Frankie stars Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda holding purple vibrators is causing quite a stir for commuters.

“Good vibes,” reads the tagline in the giant ad, promoting the third season premiere of the popular comedy series.

The sexually-charged billboard nearly caused a car crash for at least one L.A. motorist.

“Almost rear ended someone cuz it took me too long to figure out what they were holding in this ‘Grace and Frankie’ billboard,” wrote one Twitter user.

In the Netflix series, Tomlin and Fonda play two 70-somethings whose law partner husbands declare their love for each other and leave their wives, turning their lives upside down.

The longtime friends embraced each other on a billboard for the premiere of Season 2. But given the sex toy-centric plot in Season 3 — as the two women start a female sex toy business — the vibrator ad in midtown Hollywood makes sense. It makes even more sense following Netflix’s promotion of the show last week with a short clip featuring Tomlin’s Frankie dancing on the beach alongside a slew of shimmying dildos.

On Monday, Tomlin and Fonda appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to promote the upcoming season.

Fonda took the opportunity to pitch a business opportunity to President Donald Trump; a line of adult diapers she called ‘Trumpers,” which she joked would “help with all the leaks.”

Deputy White House chief of staff Katie Walsh is no longer going to be working in President Donald Trump’s White House, Politico reports.

Politico reported on Thursday afternoon:

President Donald Trump is undergoing his first staff shake-up less than three months into his term, sending deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to bolster the flagging outside groups that were meant to support his agenda, according to a Republican source close to the White House. The move caps a rough stretch for Trump, who has seen his young administration dogged by controversy, his travel ban executive order blocked twice in court, and a health care bill he supported go down in flames.

Walsh, Politico reports and independent sources confirm to Breitbart News, will now be serving as “an adviser both to a pro-Trump nonprofit and the RNC.”

Politico notes that Walsh is a “close ally of chief of staff Reince Priebus,” having served as his chief of staff at the Republican National Committee.

Walsh previously told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview ahead of President Trump’s exclusive interview with Breitbart News in the Oval Office that she was in charge of the president’s schedule, and coordinating the activities of Trump’s unusual circuit of senior aides like Priebus, chief strategist and former Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, and Trump son-in-law and senior adviser to the president Jared Kushner.

Walsh said in the exclusive interview with Breitbart News last month:

As you know, we’ve got a lot of senior folks in the White House who have a great ability to help push the president’s agenda and message and that’s Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, KellyAnne Conway, and others, but there is a logistical piece of that that has to get implemented and so I try and help with that. So I try and do what I can to make sure the right hand is talking to the left hand and everyone knows what everyone is doing, and there is a cohesive operation or effort to make sure, whatever we’re doing, that nothing happens in a silo if you will. So even if Reince is with the president working on something, and Jared is working on an issue related to trade, and Steve is working on an issue related to immigration or something, we try and make sure everyone is still on the same page and working together and moving together as fast as we can.

But rumors surfaced online that Walsh was leaking information about the White House.

“Everyone knows not to talk to her in the White House unless you want to see it in the press,” Got News editor Charles Johnson quoted a “source close to the president” as saying in February. “The only question is whether or not she’s doing it at the behest of [White House Chief of Staff] Reince Priebus or if she’s doing it to advance herself in DC media circles.”

In a meeting with reporters, however, Priebus, Kushner, and Bannon all defended Walsh.

Bannon on Walsh: &quot;She&apos;s the vital link that pulls things together and makes things happen.&quot; https://t.co/Jon62BpL7e — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) March 30, 2017

But Walsh’s quick departure in the first 100 days does not bode well for those responsible for bringing her in. Priebus, many reports in recent days and weeks have shown, is on the hot seat and may find himself in a similar fate to Walsh. Many Trump allies both inside and outside the White House believe that Priebus is not serving the president’s best interests, partially because of his loyalty to House Speaker Paul Ryan and partially because of his inability to deliver big ticket agenda items in the Trump White House and throughout Washington—as well as getting the Trump administration off the ground with basic government appointments filled.

One ex-Trump aide speculated to Breitbart News that Priebus is next.

“Reince Priebus is now a dead man walking,” the aide said. “The firing of Katie Walsh was a sign of desperation.”

However, a White House official told Time Magazine’s Zeke Miller that Priebus is fine.

Sources tell Breitbart News there may be more announcements coming soon as it relates to other senior staff inside the White House. White House press secretary Sean Spicer has not responded to a request for comment on the news that Walsh is being removed from the White House.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2071d53d:7dfe31:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Virginia Republican Rep. Dave Brat told reporters in a hallway just off the House floor that he is confused by President Donald Trump’s tweets attacking the House Freedom Caucus for hindering the president’s agenda—specifically the American Health Care Act, or Ryancare.

“I don’t know who has his ear,” said Brat, who is a member of the House Freedom Caucus and was part of the HFC team negotiating with the White House and the House Republican leadership to amend the Ryancare bill.

“I don’t think he is hearing that we are trying to serve him a victory–right?–Right now, this bill is at 17 percent in the polls, and that’s not a winner.”

The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don&apos;t get on the team, &amp; fast. We must fight them, &amp; Dems, in 2018! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017

Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) pulled the bill from the House floor Friday minutes before it was sure to be defeated.

The Ryancare bill is a modification of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that created Obamacare. Although it was pulled from the floor, it is still active legislation and subject to manager’s amendments from the chairmen of the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget committees, as well as changes made by the House Rules Committee, which reports the bill to the House floor with its final language.

Brat said the key to fixing the American Health Care Act is to correct Obamacare provisions that drove up premiums, but in the current language in the Ryancare bill, premiums would still go up 10 percent or 15 percent.

“Right now, no young person can go out and buy a cheap insurance policy–by law,” he said. “The federal regulations and mandates prevent you from shopping across state lines, which President Trump campaigned on.”

The president campaigned all over the country and told every arena audience that he would repeal Obamacare.

Brat said the House Freedom Caucus is staying true to the president’s campaign promises, which were not reflected in the Ryancare bill.

See my statement on the American Health Care Act #AHCA https://t.co/HPu7MiU8bo — Rep. Dave Brat (@RepDaveBrat) March 25, 2017

Another problem with the speaker’s bill was that it was rushed through in a process that took only three weeks from Ryan releasing the text of the bill to what would have been a vote on the House floor.

“If you have a good process, it will result in a good policy; and then, that’s good politics,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2071d53d:7dfe30:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily, guest Peter Schweizer talked about President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his role in the controversy over meetings between Trump transition team members and various foreign interests.

On Wednesday, Kushner Cos. and the Anbang Insurance Group of China reportedly agreed to end talks about securing investment in an office tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The deal had been criticized as an effort by the Chinese to win favor with the Trump administration.

“The biggest concern that I’ve had is whether Jared Kushner, whether it’s the president’s sons who are running the real estate business, that they are going to be offered or they are going to seek out sweetheart deals with foreign government entities – Chinese, Russian, Kazakhstan, you name it,” Schweizer told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.

“That’s where the vulnerability is, because they will make a killing financially, and a foreign entity will then gain leverage or favors from the Trump administration,” he said.

“These things are very worrisome. Again, there’s no deals that seem to have been sealed, and there’s no evidence that there have been financial transfers,” he noted. “But this needs to be monitored – and monitored, I think, with great intensity because this has been a repeated pattern in American politics.”

Peter Schweizer is a senior editor at large for Breitbart News, president of the Government Accountability Institute, and author of the best-selling Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has indicated that he will support parts of the U.S. breaking away as revenge for President Donald J. Trump supporting Britain’s decision to leave the European Union (EU) and predicting other countries will follow.

“The newly elected U.S. president was happy that Brexit was taking place, and asked other countries to do the same,” he told at a European People’s Party conference, recalling the president’s prediction that Brexit will be “fantastic” for the United Kingdom.

“If he goes on like that,” he said, “I am going to promote the independence of Ohio and Austin, Texas.”

“Juncker has made a complete fool of himself,” commented Brexit campaign leader and former UKIP chief Nigel Farage in a press release.

“He clearly does not understand the difference between the EU and the United States of America. One was formed by consent while the other is being imposed.”

“The US is an organically formed nation with a single language and similar culture, while the cultural and linguistic differences in the EU are immense.

“If this is what Juncker calls diplomacy, he needs to take a long hard look at himself.”

Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, has also been rated poorly as a statesman by Professor Ted Malloch, widely tipped as President Trump’s preferred ambassador to the EU.

Professor Malloch recommended that Juncker returns to his former status as an “adequate mayor” in his native city-state in a televised interview with the BBC. He likened the EU to the Soviet Union and suggesting that, like the Soviet Union, it “needs a little taming”.

The European Commission is perhaps the most powerful institution in the EU. It is a hybrid body, acting as its executive but also retaining the sole power to initiate EU legislation, which overrides the domestic legislation of the bloc’s member-states.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b2071d53d:7dfe2d:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">WATCH: @SpeakerRyan says &quot;the big chunk of money&quot; for the border wall is &quot;next fiscal year&apos;s appropriations&quot; https://t.co/MtqoVkdTZL pic.twitter.com/0rgF3L5cad

In an interview that aired on “CBS This Morning,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told show co-host Norah O’Donnell the upcoming budget legislation required to prevent a government shutdown will include money to the Department of Homeland Security for border security, but it won’t be the main part of the funding for the President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall.

According to Ryan, that will come with next fiscal year’s appropriations bill.

“The big chunk of money for the border wall really is next year’s fiscal appropriations,” Ryan said. “Because they literally can’t start construction even this quickly.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan is still pushing his plan to replace Obamacare, despite the bill failing to earn enough Republican support to move it forward.

In an interview with CBS, Ryan warned his fellow Republicans that if they didn’t work with him to replace health care, President Donald Trump would work with Democrats.

“If this Republican Congress allows the perfect to be the enemy of the good, I worry we’ll push the president into working with Democrats,” he warned.

Ryan said that he didn’t want to work with Democrats and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on health care.

“I don’t want that to happen. You know why? I want a patient-centered system,” he said. “I don’t want government running health care.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1fe7eb41:6eaa9c:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. military has not “relaxed” the rules of engagement (ROE) to avoid civilian casualties in the ongoing fight against the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL), commonly known for using the home of innocent people as shelter and the inhabitants as shields, the top American commander in the region told lawmakers.

On Wednesday, American Gen. Joseph Votel, the chief of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), told the House Armed Services Committee:

The nature of this fight has evolved over the course of the operation on this two and a half year campaign, and our approach has evolved as well. One example of how we have evolved has been our effort to enable and entrust our leaders at the tactical edge with the authorities they need to help our partners win. We have not relaxed the rules of engagement. I have authorized Lt. Gen. [Stephen] Townsend to delegate the employment of rules of engagement to the appropriate level due to the tough urban fight that we knew was coming in Mosul. To be clear, there were no changes… to the rules of engagement that allows us to engage.

Gen. Townsend is the top commander of U.S. ground troops in Iraq.

Votel’s testimony came in response to an allegation by a human rights group that a recent decision to loosen the U.S. military’s rules of combat continues to fuel an ongoing spate in civilian casualties in the besieged Iraqi city of Mosul.

The Amnesty International report explicitly highlights the death of an estimated 150 people in a U.S.-led coalition airstrike on March 17, calling it “one of the deadliest strikes in years.”

Gen. Votel stressed that the U.S. military is investigating the allegation.

Wednesday’s House panel hearing was focused on security challenges faced by Gen. Votel in his area of responsibility (AOR), which includes the Middle East and Northeast Africa as well as South and Central Asia.

Echoing Gen. Townsend, the CENTCOM chief told House lawmakers, “There is a fair chance that our operations may have contributed to civilian casualties [in Mosul]. But I would highlight to each of you that this investigation continues, and there is still much to learn from this.”

Gen. Votel noted that the U.S. had assigned a general officer to dig up the facts of the incident and help the American military address the situation, adding:

While we consider and establish accountability over our actions in this incident, I think is also important to clearly recognize that the enemy does use human shields, has little regard for human life and does attempt to use civilian casualty allegations as a tool to hinder our operations. And so they bear responsibility for this as well.

Nevertheless, Amnesty’s report suggests that a loosening of American military combat rules under President Donald Trump are to blame for the high number of civilian casualties in Mosul.

“The high civilian toll suggests that coalition forces leading the offensive in Mosul have failed to take adequate precautions to prevent civilian deaths, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law,” proclaimed Donatella Rovera, the senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty International, who carried out field investigations in Mosul.

Alluding to the rise in civilian fatalities in Mosul, Votel told lawmakers, “This should be an indicator to you of how intense of a combat situation this is,” later adding, “The investigation [into the March 17 strike] will confirm or deny our initial impressions and highlight the lessons learned.”

The U.S. military believes ISIS may have rigged the building targeted by the coalition on March 17 with explosives after forcing civilians to hide inside.

However, Amnesty insists alleged evidence collected in Mosul “points to an alarming pattern of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes which have destroyed whole houses with entire families inside.”

Gen. Votel declared Wednesday:

These are absolutely tragic and heartbreaking situations, And our hearts go out to the people of Mosul and of Iraq and other places where we are operating. We acknowledge our responsibility to operate at a higher standard. It is my responsibility as a combatant commander to ensure that our forces operate in accordance with those goals and standards. We take every allegation seriously, and we are executing…a well-developed process to assess — and if necessary investigate each of these allegations…we are doing everything humanly possible to prevent these types of events and incidents from occurring as a result of our operations.

The U.S.-led coalition and its Iraqi allies believe Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria are ISIS’s last major strongholds in their ever diminishing so-called caliphate.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1f425ca9:630d71:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Tuesday, President Trump told a group of senators gathered for a White House reception that “we’re doing very well in Iraq” where “our soldiers are fighting like never before.” He said this assessment was based on a long telephone call with Secretary of Defense James Mattis.

Trump’s comments were interpreted by some critics as a slam against the American troops who fought in the Iraq War – if they are “fighting like never before” now, the argument goes, Trump must think the soldiers deployed to Iraq in the Bush administration were not fighting so hard.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed this criticism on Wednesday, saying President Trump was referring to “progress, particularly in Mosul, the way that they have taken back that city.”

“I think that for a long time, there was a lot of concern about Iran moving in and dominating parts of Iraq,” Spicer continued. “I think with the advice and consent of U.S. military advisers, there’s been tremendous progress at moving Iraq forward to an area of stability, and continuing to see the troops there in Iraq standing on their own.”

Spicer said the president pleased with the action that General Mattis and our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are taking to do that.”

“He was very proud of the work that our soldiers are doing over there in Iraq. There is a lot of work, and a lot of progress that is being made,” said Spicer. “The fight against ISIS is going extremely well, and he’s proud of it.”

Critics of Trump’s fight against ISIS dwell on mounting civilian casualties and confusion in Iraq’s military ranks, but Doyle McManus at the L.A. Times wrote on Wednesday that Trump “may actually win the war against the Islamic State”:

Under Obama, who waged a “light footprint” strategy with minimal U.S. troops, Islamic State lost most of the territory it once held in Iraq and almost a third of what it held in Syria. But taking the extremist group’s most important strongholds, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria, was taking longer. Enter Trump. The new president, after claiming he had a secret plan to win the war, told his generals to give him one in 30 days. They responded with an outline — a “skeleton plan,” in the words of Defense Secretary James N. Mattis – that could be described as Obama Plus: more bombing, more troops, fewer restrictions on commanders. “The Obama strategy wasn’t failing, but it was slow,” James F. Jeffrey, a former ambassador (and former Army officer) who’s advising the administration, told me. “This is more — not only more troops, but more willingness to use them. It’s a change of maybe 20%, but it’s an important 20%.”

McManus notes the task at hand is more complex than Trump’s campaign rhetoric about “bombing the s**t out of them,” blowing up “every single inch” of the Islamic State and then bringing in oil companies to rebuild from the ruins. He gives Defense Secretary Mattis credit for influencing White House policy, which now appears to envision aggressive military victory over ISIS, followed by an extended troop commitment to achieve “stabilization.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1f425ca9:630d70:e55a4d93</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

An editorial in the weekly publication of the largest Mexican Roman Catholic Archdiocese, Desde la fe—Catholic Seminary of Information and Training—warned Mexicans that helping President Donald Trump build a wall on the United States border would make them “traitors of the homeland,” Reuters reported.

“Any company intending to invest in the wall of the fanatic Trump would be immoral, but above all, its shareholders and owners should be considered traitors to the homeland,” the editorial said.

Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo earlier this month warned firms it would not be in their “interests” to participate in building the wall, but the editorial accused the Mexican government of responding “tepidly” to those considering the wall as a business opportunity, according to Reuters.

A spokesman for the Archdiocese, Cardinal Norberto Rivera, said the editorial reflects the views of the diocese.

The Desde la fe editorial, which was posted online, said the barrier would increase prejudice and discrimination against Mexican people.

“In practice, signing up for a project that is a serious affront to dignity is shooting yourself in the foot,” the editorial said.

According to Reuters, Mexican cement maker Cemex has said it is “open” to providing estimates on the raw materials needed for the wall but will not take part in the bidding process to build it.

Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua, another business that provides construction materials, has said it might work on the project.

On March 11, The Guardian reported that one in 10 firms bidding on Trump’s wall are owned by Hispanic Americans. Some 600 businesses have expressed interest in the $21 billion project.

“We’re not into politics,” Jorge Diaz, manager of De la Fuente Construction, Inc., said. “We’re not left or right.

“We’re a construction company and that’s how we survive,” Diaz said. “We don’t see it as politics. We just see it as work.”

Next Wednesday is the deadline for companies interested in the project to submit “concept papers” to the federal government, The Guardian reported today.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1dc0b30e:351045:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The myth of “jobs Americans won’t do” is once again on the rise.

And just like the last time you heard about this alleged economic malaise, it is nonsense.

The most recent peddlers of the labor shortage bunk are homebuilders. They say that they could be building many more homes if only they could find the workers to build them. The shortage of workers is creating a shortage of homes, driving up prices and putting homeownership out of reach for more Americans, they claim.

Here’s a sample from CNBC on Thursday:

Thousands of construction workers left the industry during the recession, many of them heading to the energy sector. The assumption was that they would return when energy lagged and homebuilding recovered. They did not. The labor shortage in building actually worsened in 2016 — a surprise to most analysts. “We thought we’d see a flow back of workers from the energy sector,” said Rob Dietz, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders. “The labor shortage has basically grown and accelerated. It’s the top challenge in the building industry right now.” Dietz points to both an immigration and a generational challenge. The workforce is aging, with the typical age of a construction worker now 42. More Americans are going to college now, and so they are less likely to pursue a career in construction. Simply put, young Americans don’t want to build houses anymore. That leaves the business to immigrant laborers. “These jobs, Americans don’t want,” Myers said. “We have a hard-working Hispanic labor force here in Denver that really is the foundation for the construction industry.”

If there’s a massive job shortage in homebuilding, however, wages should be skyrocketing. That’s not happening.

The average hourly wage adjusted of nonsupervisory workers engaged in the construction of buildings was $25.65 in January 2017, according to the most recent data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s an increase of just 7.18 percent over the inflation adjusted January 2007 average of $23.93. In other words, real wage increases in building construction have averaged around 0.72 percent per year over the past decade.

That increase is less than the 8.6 percent real wage gains of nonsupervisory private sector workers overall during the same period.

The fact that construction work wage gains lag behind those of the U.S. workforce is clear and decisive evidence that there is no labor shortage. These aren’t jobs that Americans won’t do–they are jobs that homebuilders aren’t willing to pay for.

With that in mind, let’s get back to CNBC’s report:

Labor is the top concern among the nation’s builders, according to an NAHB survey, and worry over its cost and availability is growing. “Because the building industry is highly decentralized — there are 40,000 homebuilding companies in the country — you do see poaching. There are situations where you can recruit a worker, and they can work for you for a quarter or two, and then they’re working for another subcontractor down the road,” Dietz said. Myers says he tries to build relationships with subcontractors. He has one-on-one meetings to build brand loyalty, but he admits, it often comes down to cold, hard cash.

Imagine that. In America’s capitalist economy, employers are complaining that workers leave to work for competitors because they just aren’t loyal enough. They make their decisions based on “cold, hard cash.”

The picture is even bleaker on a longer time horizon. Way back in 1961, the average hourly wage in construction was $3.48. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $28.35 today. Which means that we’re paying construction workers less today than we were 56 years ago.

So why are the homebuilders arguing there is a labor shortage? Because they want the U.S. to import more immigrants to hold down the price of hourly construction labor.

And they’re barely pretending otherwise. Here’s how CNBC puts it:

Immigrants make up about a quarter of the overall construction workforce, but that share is likely higher for residential homebuilding, partly due to a large number of undocumented workers. Builders say they make sure their contractors are legal to work, but they have less control over the subcontractors who often move from site to site. Even that group is shrinking, as President Donald Trump tries to impose travel bans and threatens to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. “There is a fear to get out into the labor force, I think there is an uncertainty,” Myers said. “I had one of our trades who became a citizen last year ask me if that could be taken away from him. Even for the people who are legal and documented, it’s a factor that is holding back the labor force.”

Myers has it backward. What’s holding back the labor force isn’t a lack of workers. It’s the insistence of homebuilders that they be served a constant stream of cheap labor to keep their production costs down and profits up.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1da5177f:32d58d:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Two more Republicans announced their support on Wednesday for the Supreme Court majority-vote “constitutional option,” following the news that additional Democratic senators have promised to filibuster Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.

Democrats slam the constitutional option as the so-called “nuclear option,” because it would end their ability to filibuster by changing Senate rules to allow a simple majority of fifty-one votes to force a floor vote. Under current rules, approval from 60 Senators — meaning all 52 Republicans plus eight Democrats — is needed to hold a vote.

On Wednesday, Sen. Corey Gardner (R-CO) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA) said they are prepared to vote for the constitutional option.

“Neil Gorsuch will be an associate justice on the United States Supreme Court,” Gardner told the Denver Post. “It’s just a matter of how it happens.”

Toomey told the Philadelphia Daily News, “If that [confirming Gorsuch] means we have to change the Senate rules, it will be a very sad day for the Senate, but if that’s what it takes, that’s what it takes.”

Gorsuch, who has been nominated by President Donald Trump to replace iconic conservative jurist Justice Antonin Scalia, has received praise from across the political spectrum in the past. But Senate Democrats and left-wing activist groups are now criticizing his record as they try to block his nomination.

On Wednesday, Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) both announced they would join Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s promised filibuster to block Gorsuch from receiving a vote on the Senate Floor. At least twenty Democratic senators have suggested they will support a Democratic filibuster.

Heinrich argued that the Senate cannot confirm Judge Gorsuch until the Senate has completed its open-ended investigations into the Trump campaign’s alleged ties with Russia. “It would not be responsible to move forward with President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee until these Russia-related allegations are resolved,” he told the New Mexico Political Report. Kaine, meanwhile, was sparser on the explanation of his opposition to Gorsuch,

Kaine simply made a political argument, telling the Associated Press that the judge’s rulings “do not demonstrate a philosophy that belongs on the Supreme Court.”

The Human Rights Campaign issued a press release calling for “pro-equality” senators to filibuster Gorsuch because he once referred to homosexual marriage as “part of the liberal social agenda” and also joined in a decision denying female hormones to an imprisoned man.

Across the aisle, a parallel group of Republican senators has resigned themselves to using the so-called “nuclear option,” changing Senate rules to allow a simple majority of fifty-one votes to invoke cloture and force a floor vote as opposed to the sixty now required. Two more prominent Senate GOPers said they are prepared to take this step Wednesday: Sen. Corey Gardner (R-CO), from whose state Gorsuch hails, and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA).

The Senate is currently scheduled to vote on Gorsuch’s confirmation, April 7.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1d897b5c:346f47:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is leading a filibuster against Judge Neil Gorsuch, called a press conference Wednesday to further his and his fellow Democrat senators’ commitment to blocking President Donald Trump’s SOTUS nominee.

However, during a 2013 press conference, Schumer took on a different perspective and heartily spoke against the very conduct he and his fellow Democat lawmakers are engaged in, saying Democrats prefer “up-or-down” votes over obstruction, “no matter who’s in power.”

At the time, he stated,”We much prefer the risk of up-or-down votes in majority rule, than the risk of continued total obstruction. That is the bottom line, no matter who’s in power.”

Also on Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz said, “The notion of filibustering federal judges” was largely invented by Schumer.

Wednesday’s press conference, which was led by Schumer and Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), drew attention to the alleged use of “dark money” being spent by special interest group Judicial Crisis Network and to ask for the disclosure of the donors who are funding the $10 million campaign supporting Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court.

Schumer argued against Republican talk of invoking the “nuclear option,” saying that all recent high court nominees have reached a 60-vote threshold. He suggested the same for Gorsuch.

“Republicans should not make it their choice to go nuclear,’ Schumer said. “And if the nuclear option is invoked, it’s because our Republicans in the Senate chose to do so.”

Schumer suggested, instead, replacing Gorsuch with a different nominee—a tactic that would further stall President Trump from filling the seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s passing. Schumer suggested the reason Gorsuch “is having trouble earning 60 votes” is because he “represents the hard-right special interests wing of American politics.” He also said,”We believe in a 60-vote threshold. That’s why we filed a cloture motion.”

Schumer continued, “Judge Gorsuch, we believe, does not belong on the bench. We also believe there are Republicans who are reluctant to change the rules,” he said of certain lawmakers to whom he referred as “free actors.” He added, “We hope they don’t.”

The Hill reported earlier this month that “Gorsuch declined to take the bait” when Whitehouse asked him if as a “matter of courtesy to the process,” he would ask his anonymous backers to reveal themselves to the public. “You could ask right now as a matter of courtesy, as a matter of respect for the process, that anybody funding this should declare themselves right now so we can evaluate who is behind this effort,” Whitehouse reportedly said.

Gorsuch replied, “It would be a politics question and I’m not, with all respect senator, going to get involved in politics.”

Meanwhile, Sen. Blumenthal seemed to make an argument as to why Republicans would want to confirm Gorsuch. “Gorsch has showed himself to be skillful, artful, articulate, and a deeply conservative judge with that bend, who can sway his colleagues.”

Schumer again emphasized, “If they’re so quick to change the rules this time, they’ll change the rules again next time.”

In the past, Schumer has expressed his regret over Senate Democrats’ decision to trigger the nuclear option in 2013, in order to decrease the number of senators needed to confirm Cabinet picks from 60 to 51 votes.

“I wish it hadn’t happened,” Schumer said in an interview with CNN, about the move that was triggered by former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid (D-NV).

The move is dubbed the “nuclear option” because by altering the filibuster rules it stands to blow up bipartisan Senate relations.

“I argued against it at the time,” Schumer said. “I said both for Supreme Court and in Cabinet it should be 60, because on such important positions there should be some degree of bipartisanship. I won on Supreme Court, lost on Cabinet. But, that’s what we have to live with now.”

Gun Owners of America (GOA) is urging freedom-loving Americans to contact their Senators and urge them to confirm Neil Gorsuch as the next justice of the Supreme Court.

GOA suggests the choice of confirming or not confirming is so clear cut that it boils down to one thing: ‘Do you support the Second Amendment?’

Gorsuch is President Trump’s nominee to fill the vacancy left behind by Second Amendment bulwark Antonin Scalia. And Gorsuch’s nomination proves Trump true to his promise to put forward a justice “very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.”

GOA executive director Erich Pratt said, “Gun Owners of America is urging people to contact their Senators and ask for an ‘aye’ vote for the Senate.”

Gorsuch&apos;s nomination comes down to this: do you support the Second Amendment? Urge your Senator to #ComfirmGorsuch: https://t.co/PIATzYo63l pic.twitter.com/OgIvBxMmRr — GOA (@GunOwners) March 25, 2017

GOA executive director emeritus Larry Pratt said, “[Gorsuch] supports the Second Amendment as it was written [and] as it was understood at the time. So we’re pretty comfortable getting Mr. Gorsuch on the court, that he is going to be pretty much in line of Antonin Scalia.”

Larry also said, “This is going to be a whole lot better an appointment that if Hillary Clinton had been making it, that is for sure.”

Breitbart News reported that Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) questioned Gorsuch during the confirmation hearings and used that opportunity to try to discover even a chance that he would be open to more gun control. What she found was Gorsuch standing on the law and the precedent of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). Gorsuch said, “Whatever is in Heller is the law and I follow the law.”

Former President Barack Obama’s efforts to shut down the coal industry in the United States have threatened the well-being of generations of coal plant and mine workers, including those of the Navajo Nation.

The Navajo Generating Station and the Kayenta Mine on Navajo land in Arizona has directly and indirectly provided 3,100 jobs and $180 million in annual income to workers and their families.

The lease agreements, royalties, and other payments are tied to the plant and mine account for approximately 20 percent of Navajo Nation annual general fund revenue, with the money used to fund schools, emergency services, infrastructure, and public parks.

And now, because regulations have driven up the cost of coal, the plant owners who lease the land have announced it will close in 2019, adding even more strain to a community that suffers from a 42 percent unemployment rate and 43 percent of its people living below the federal poverty line.

Now, the Navajo Nation hopes that President Donald Trump and the Department of the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will help resolve this crisis by working to keep the plant open for 10 years so that alternative income streams can be developed ahead of its closure.

“The president made a pledge to the coal industry to do whatever he can to help those workers,” a senior white house official told reporters on Monday ahead of Trump’s executive order on Tuesday to roll back much of the “climate change” policies put in place by Obama.

Russell Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation, is counting on the Trump administration’s resolve. Begaye told Breitbart News:

For decades, clean coal power has been a critical economic engine for the Navajo Nation by creating thousands of jobs and substantial revenue for our people. The expedited closure of the Navajo Generating Station, the largest clean coal fired coal plant in the western United States, would create an economic disaster that would devastate Navajo families and our entire economy. President Trump ran on a pledge to ‘bring back coal’ and we believe that he will keep his word and stand up for coal workers on the Navajo Nation and across the United States. We are also optimistic about working with the Trump Administration to help our people given the President’s unwavering support for coal jobs and mine workers.

Begaye traveled to Washington earlier this month to meet with federal officials and lawmakers, and he wrote in a recent oped in The Hill that he is “optimistic” about the future. He wrote:

We are … optimistic about working with the Trump Administration on this issue given the president’s unwavering support for coal jobs and mine workers. President Trump ran on a pledge to ‘bring back coal’ and provide economic opportunities for workers who have been left behind by coal’s declining fortunes. President Trump has an excellent opportunity to deliver on this promise by using the bully pulpit to help our people keep this plant open long enough to find new, high paying jobs.

According to the federal Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2016 (AEO), “Coal prices will generally increase through the year 2040. The amount that coal prices increase depends on projections for coal demand and coal mining productivity. The implementation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan is a major factor in the projections for coal demand in the AEO.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1d897b5c:346f43:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A Washington Post reporter is looking for a family of illegal aliens so she can “help readers place themselves in the shoes of someone who feels no longer welcome in the United States,” according to an email obtained by Breitbart.

The request comes hot on the heels of a widely reported violent gang rape of a 14-year old in the same area for which two illegal aliens have been charged.

The request from Washington Post reporter Jessica Contrera was sent to an immigration lawyer, who then shared it Tuesday, March 28, via an email list with other lawyers at the Maryland State Bar Association. “I spend my time working on in-depth stories about the lives of people who are being affected by topics unfolding in the news,” Contrera wrote.

She continued:

I’m reaching out because I’m hoping my next story will be focused on an undocumented family. Specifically, I’m looking for a person or family who is voluntarily choosing to leave the U.S. and return to their home country, given the political climate and the increased threat of deportation I can’t begin to imagine what a stressful and difficult decision it must be to leave your life behind, and I’m hoping that by spending time with a person or family as they prepare for their departure, I can help readers place themselves in the shoes of someone who feels no longer welcome in the United States. I’m getting in touch with you in hopes of finding out if the situation I described is something that’s happening in your area, and if you know anyone who might be leaving the country in the coming weeks. If so, I’d love to talk with you about my work and how I might best find this story.

According to a confidential source privy to the mailing list, reporters from left-wing news outlets routinely query the immigration section for sympathetic clients to help build their narrative.

The same source said he believes the focus on Maryland was specifically tailored to counter last week’s reporting on the Rockville high school’s alleged gang rape, which defense attorneys are already trying to spin into an attack on innocent illegal aliens. Even the New York Times reported that several liberal media outlets refused to report on the gang rape as that story unfolded, saying, “Viewers would not have heard about [the rape] if they had turned to CNN or MSNBC.”

Contrera did not respond to emails and phone calls made by Breitbart.

Contrera’s strategy of seeking out anecdotes to build empathy with illegal aliens matches President Donald Trump’s description of establishment immigration reporting: that it focuses on the plight of illegal aliens before that of Americans.

“The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be … There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people,” Trump told a crowd of supporters on the campaign trail in August 2016.

“The mainstream media always looks for sob stories to undermine the legitimacy of immigration enforcement,” said Mark Krikorian, the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think-tank which studies the impact of immigration on the United States. “They almost never like to tell comparable stories … of people killed by illegal immigrants, of the small contractor put out of business by those employing immigrant labor,” he told Breitbart. “Reporters themselves internalize this.”

According to her letter, Contrera is not seeking an American family to highlight the plight of the American communities most affected by mass illegal immigration. Her own publication periodically describes their economic woes, but rarely links them to the flood of labor enabled by lax federal immigration enforcement and permissive immigration policies.



In September 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a long report on immigration, which included an analysis showing that cheap-labor immigration annually transfers roughly $500 million from Americans’ salaries and wages, over to investors and company owners. The report also shows that each unskilled immigrant costs state and local taxpayers $1,600 per year.

Asked about Contrera’s Maryland solicitation being so close in time and place to the Rockville High arrests, Krikorian said, “It makes perfect sense. The Rockville rape case is interfering with the narrative … [and progressive] reporters instinctually try to ‘balance the narrative’ with these kinds of anecdotes.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1cffb87b:25d319:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A Democratic senator has asked the Office of Government Ethics to investigate comments made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in an interview this week, in which he appeared to jokingly “plug” one of his previous company’s films, The Lego Batman Movie.

Senate Finance Committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) sent a letter to OGE Ethics Director Walter Schaub this week asking for a probe into the comments made by Mnuchin — a Hollywood film financier before taking a job in the Trump administration — in a live interview with news outlet Axios on Friday.

In the letter, Wyden asked the ethics watchdog to investigate whether Mnuchin may have promoted the product of a business he still holds interest in — namely, the production company RatPac-Dune Entertainment — when he urged attendees at the Axios event to send their kids to see the Lego Batman Movie, which was produced by RatPac Dune.

“I am concerned that Sec. Mnuchin’s comments, may be seen to have a predictable effect on the financial interests” of RatPac-Dune, Wyden wrote in the letter.

At the Axios event on Friday, Mnuchin — whose RatPac Dune helped produce blockbuster films including Avatar and Mad Max: Fury Road — was asked to give a movie recommendation.

“Well, I’m not allowed to promote anything that I’m involved in. So I just want to have the legal disclosure, you’ve asked me the question, and I am not promoting any product,” the Treasury Secretary replied. “But you should send all your kids to Lego Batman.”

In his letter to Schaub, Wyden called the comments “troubling” and asked for the ethics watchdog to complete a review and report the results to both himself and the Treasury Department. Wyden noted that as part of his service in President Trump’s Cabinet, Mnuchin had promised to “not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that to [his] knowledge has a direct and predictable effect on the financial interests of the entity.”

Mnuchin is allowed 120 days from his confirmation to comply with the ethics agreement, but Wyden wrote that the Finance Committee had received “no evidence” to show that the Treasury Secretary had divested his interest in RatPac-Dune.

In a statement, a Treasury spokesperson pointed out that Mnuchin had deliberately stated he was not promoting the film while speaking with Axios.

“As his statement reflects, the Secretary clearly recognized that he generally may not promote private interests and specifically gave the legal disclosure that he was not promoting a movie, but answering a question he was asked directly,” the statement read.

Whatever the outcome, The Lego Batman Movie likely doesn’t need the publicity; the family-friendly animated film has grossed a total of $293 million at the international box office since its release in early February.

Greg Cote of the Miami Herald asks the question: ‘What NFL team will be brave enough (and smart enough) to give Kaepernick a chance?’

The sports writer, therefore, implies that team owners who prefer signing players who respect the National Anthem and don’t wear socks mocking police officers as pigs are cowards and stupid.

Incredibly, Cote blames team owners for not hiring the “healthy” 29-year-old quarterback “coming into his physical prime,” who has “taken his team to a Super Bowl” because they may fear negative tweets from President Donald Trump.

“What are teams afraid of?” Cote asks. “That the Commander-in-Tweet, Donald Trump, might unleash one of his 3 a.m. storms against whatever team signed him?”

Well, if it’s not that then maybe it’s “a small, brief backlash from fans who never understood that Kaepernick kneeling was far closer to patriotism than to treason?”

What? Reminiscent of George Orwell’s 1984, for Cote, refusing to stand for the National Anthem is really closer to patriotism than to treason. Does Cote also believe that standing for the National Anthem is closer to treason than it is to patriotism?

Of course, Cote doesn’t own an NFL team and will not have to sell season tickets. Nor, will he be concerned with such trivial items as making a profit or filling stadium seats. Obviously, he pays no attention to reports such as this one from CBS in October of 2016:

A fresh poll from Seton Hall surveyed 841 adults across the U.S. Each respondent was asked to identify seven separate factors as a reason for the NFL rating drop, allowing them to answer “yes” or “no” for each of them. The leading factor, according to the poll, was the national anthem protests, which scored “yes” at a rate of 56 percent.

But, Cote says don’t worry about that, because the “closer to patriotic” Kaepernick says he’s done with kneeling during the National Anthem. Interesting how he made that decision now that he is effectively unemployed and looking for another multi-million dollar contract from a team that will give him a place on the bench for the 2017 season and beyond.

So, no more kneeling for Kaepernick now, but as a precaution to any team owner “brave enough and smart enough” to sign him, you might want to check his socks first.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1ce41c6c:25fb93:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Actress Scarlett Johansson revealed she would be open to running for public office in the future in an interview Wednesday.

In a conversation with Good Morning America‘s Michael Strahan, the 32-year-old Avengers star said she has been “interested” in local politics for some time, but family commitments and her film career have kept her plenty busy.

“I’ve always, like I said, been interested in local politics,” the actress said. “Right now, I think with my young daughter and also the way my career is going right now … it’s just not the right time. But eventually, maybe when my daughter is older and I can totally focus myself on something like that, I think it could be interesting.”

The Ghost in the Shell star said she makes no apologies for supporting liberal policies that might offend her potential audience: “I’m not afraid to say what I feel is right, just because I think that I’m going to face criticism, or some people might not like me.”

In recent months, Johansson has become a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

In September, the actress appeared alongside her Avengers cast mates in a voter registration PSA meant to rev up support among younger voters and millennials to turn out on Election Day for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

The pro-abortion actress also participated in the anti-Donald Trump Women’s March in Washington D.C., where she delivered a speech railing against the president.

Scarlett Johansson to Trump: &quot;I want to be able to support you, but first, I ask that you support me&quot; and all women https://t.co/vBbG13GC3C — NBC News (@NBCNews) January 21, 2017

In her interview Wednesday, Johansson said she would continue to support left-wing organizations like Planned Parenthood even if it causes some people to stay away from her films.

“If fighting, you know, for women’s rights, for women’s reproductive rights, and you know, in support of Planned Parenthood, if that’s going to, you know, mean that some people don’t want to buy a ticket to see Ghost in the Shell, then … I’m OK with that,” she said.

President Donald Trump met on Wednesday with victims of opioid addiction and members of his committee who will address the growing crisis.

“Opioid abuse has become a crippling problem throughout the United States,” Trump said. “This is a total epidemic. And I think it’s almost untalked-about compared to the severity that we’re witnessing.”

The president was joined at the White House meeting by Vice President Mike Pence and Gov. Chris Christie, who is leading the commission. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly also attended.

Trump referred to the border, vowing to do more to stop opioid drugs from entering the country.

“Drug cartels have spread their deadly industry across our nation, and the availability of cheap narcotics, some of it comes in cheaper than candy and has devastated our communities,” Trump said.

One recovering addict, Vanessa Vitolo, explained how she became injured and got hooked on painkillers like Percocet and oxycodone. It was not long before she moved on to heroin because it was cheaper.

Vitolo said she lost everything, was homeless, and in and out of jail before she went to a treatment facility.

“You have no feelings, and you’re a shell, and it takes over your whole life,” she explained.

Thanks to her treatment, she said, she recovered from addiction and now has a job and an apartment.

“There is hope and there is a tomorrow, and there is a day after that. You just have to fight for it,” Vitolo said.

AJ Solomon, the Founder of Victory Bay Recovery Center, talked about how he got hooked on painkillers like OxyContin before getting addicted to heroin. He said his battle with addiction caused him to consider suicide.

“I planned to shoot myself,” he said. “I didn’t have a gun.”

Pam Garozzo, a drug awareness advocate, lost her son to drug addiction and blamed his use of marijuana as a gateway drug to harder drugs like heroin and crystal meth. Despite his efforts to get clean, he overdosed on meth as a senior in high school.

“Nothing in parenting prepares you to deal with the fact that Mike and I will outlive our son,” Garozzo said. “That his sisters who he idolized and who were so close to him, won’t see him anymore. That there will be empty seats at the Thanksgiving table.”

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie noted during the meeting that both he and the president were pro-life.

“We’re pro-life for the whole life, not just for the nine months in the womb,” he said. “Every life is an individual gift from God and is precious. And no life is irredeemable.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1cac828f:20d9cd:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge says Congress must pass a pending bill to close the shipping loophole allowing Chinese companies to sell lethal opioids to distributors in U.S. neighborhoods.

“We worry about weapons of mass destruction,” he told Breitbart News. “But I think 30 pounds of fentanyl in the wrong hands is a weapon of mass destruction.”

In 2014, roughly 47,000 in the U.S. died from drug overdoses, especially from heroin and other opiates. Heroin overdose deaths more than tripled between 2010 and 2015.

The bill, titled the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention, or the “STOP Act,” is being championed by Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman.

Ridge, a senior advisor with the non-profit group “Americans for Securing All Packages” (ASAP), is working to halt the spread of the deadly opioid epidemic ravaging American families.

Fentanyl is usually 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin—dousing the body’s opioid receptors in the brain stem, spine, and gut all at once, obliterating pain and potentially triggering an overdose. One quarter of a milligram of fentanyl can kill a person. As Breitbart News reported, fentanyl-induced deaths rose a staggering 72 percent from 2014 to 2015, with 9,580 dying from overdoses in 2015 compared to 5,544 in 2014.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grimly noted in a January report that half a million people died from drug overdoses between 2000 and 2014.

“It’s been an issue that’s growing in severity for the past two or three years,” said Ridge. “Sometimes these problems have to rise to an extreme level before people start paying attention to it, although I think you started paying attention to it some time ago,” Ridge, who also served as the first Secretary of Homeland Security, told Breitbart News. “Clearly, President Trump started paying attention to it during the primary.”

“I think he’s one of a couple candidates in New Hampshire who spoke specifically about the postal loophole, which has turned out to be a wide-open front door to illicit drug trafficking, primarily from China,” Ridge continued.

During a New Hampshire campaign stop in early October 2016, Trump promised he would protect Americans from a massive influx of deadly, illicit narcotics “poisoning our youth.” The Granite State “was really the first glimpse I got at how serious a problem we have,” Trump said.

“They’re poisoning our youth. They’re poisoning more than our youth—they’re poisoning everybody. But they’re poisoning our youth. It’s tough enough out there. Our youth doesn’t have a chance with what’s happening, and we’re not going to let it happen anymore,” Trump had said. “We’re going to help the people that are so badly addicted. We’re going to help them… I’m going to stop the drugs from coming in.”

Ridge wants to continue the battle against the opioid influx.

“I am hopeful that, one, we continue to raise awareness—that’s what we do at ASAP—and that, two, in a town looking for some bipartisan work to do together, that they follow the president’s lead, close the loophole, and support the STOP Act which has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate,” Ridge said.

Asked what the U.S. could do to halt Chinese businesses from openly advertising that they are “happy to sell” opioids so powerful that they are considered chemical weapons to U.S. buyers, Ridge said the STOP Act would at least allow officials to inspect such packages.

“The STOP Act does not pretend—does not suggest that it will eliminate, completely, the flow of illicit fentanyl from China or elsewhere,” Ridge said. “But China, according to the DEA and multiple sources, is the primary source. So we’ve got pretty much the crosshairs on that as the number-one source. And the fact is that, if we can just get them to provide the electronic data as to who the sender is, who’s to receive it, what’s contained, what’s the way—you know, we’ve built some pretty sophisticated algorithms over the years that would at least give Customs and Border Protection enough information to question the contents to pull it aside and open it up for inspection.”

From the Associated Press: “In this Aug. 9, 2016, file photo, a bag of 4-fluoro isobutyryl fentanyl which was seized in a drug raid is displayed at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Testing and Research Laboratory in Sterling, Va. Acting United States DEA administrator Chuck Rosenberg will visit China next week amid efforts to cut off the Chinese supply of deadly synthetic drugs, like fentanyl. China disputes U.S. claims that it’s the top source of opioids. Still, Beijing has already banned fentanyl, an opioid some 50 times stronger than heroin, and 18 related compounds.” (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)

“That’s what the STOP Act does,” Ridge explained. “It’s not designed to end the flow. I think one of the issues that the State Department’s got to deal with, the ambassador’s got to deal with, is much stronger diplomatic position in time. And frankly, I’d think it would be helpful to the diplomatic work that we have to do with China and other countries if [we] had bipartisan legislation that was passed and signed into law by the president.”

The opioid-overdose epidemic has caught attention from Democratic politicians as well. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill recently opened an investigation into pharmaceutical companies’ records inquiring about the drugs’ addictive qualities and the relation to marketing campaigns.

It should be noted that it may only take seven days to become addicted to opioids, according to the Utah Department of Health. One week of taking narcotic painkillers can suddenly deliver someone into a lifetime of addiction, or what’s left of it—before too many of already-metabolized morphine molecules bind with opioid receptors in the brain stem and shut down the user’s ability to draw their next breath.

Of course, heroin addiction can slowly consume one before one realizes it has, as one user explained:

I have literally never met anyone who was introduced to heroin with a needle. That’s roughly the equivalent of taking your first drink of alcohol by butt-chugging moonshine out of a gas can. The reality is a lot less abrupt, and a lot scarier: Most people start by popping and smoking pills. In that stage, it never seems like a problem, because you can use daily for weeks with no withdrawal effects whatsoever.

“Once you’re at the stage where you’re even considering the needle, you long ago forgot about ‘squeamishness’ right along with ‘work’ and ‘everything else you ever wanted to accomplish in your life,’” the former user added.

Breitbart News also asked Ridge what he would say to American families ravaged by opioid addiction. “Well, I’m glad you said—you phrased it the right way,” Ridge sighed. “Because you may have someone in your family that’s addicted. You may have an individual that’s addicted, but it affects the family, friends of the family, and the broader community.”

From the Associated Press: “In this Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015, photo, Dorothy McIntosh Shuemake, mother of Alison Shuemake, cries as she clutches her daughter’s toy stuffed rabbit during an interview at her home, in Middletown, Ohio. Alison Shuemake, 18, died Aug. 26, after a suspected heroin overdose when she and her partner were found unresponsive at their home and needles were present nearby.” (AP Photo/John Minchillo)

“And so, I think what we need to say to the families of those who are addicted to this—and remember, we’ve got—alcohol addiction is a huge problem,” he continued. “And more often than not, unless there’s family intervention, it’s a one-way trip to oblivion. And I think it’s also like mental health problems. The stigma of addiction, and the stigma associated with mental health problems—we should be more tolerant in a society to accept the reality that as humans, we’re flawed, but these things do happen from time to time.”

Federal data shows that “deaths of despair,” particularly among middle-aged, white Americans, have risen starkly in less than two decades, as researchers Angus Deaton and Anne Case told NPR earlier in March. Whites are steadily poisoning themselves with opioids and lethal amounts of alcohol, and are committing suicide in disturbing numbers. Middle-aged whites account for one-third of all U.S. suicides. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention found that seven out of every 10 suicides were committed by white men in 2015.

Ridge said that communities must come together and help families hurt by addiction.

“And so, as a broader community, we need to appreciate the horror that the family deals with, if they have a family member who’s addicted right now,” he said. “And, frankly, to look for ways to provide as much support and treatment as possible.”

“But I know it might be somewhat simplistic, but I know families… where there’s been addiction to drugs and alcohol,” Ridge said. “Sometimes, that intersession—and [getting] them to remediation—and get them to care, works. And sometimes it doesn’t.”

Some 30,000 Americans die each year due to heroin and painkiller pill addiction in the United States.” (Getty Images)

“And what do you say to the families?” Ridge asked again. “It’s difficult to live with that in your family. And I think I understand that as an observer. I’m sure it breaks your heart, and for many people, it may break the bank as they’re trying to deal with it. But I would just encourage them to do everything they can to get the loved one that’s addicted, get them as much help as soon as possible. There has to be intervention.”

Breitbart News also asked Ridge whether the Trump administration’s two-pronged strategy of cracking down on drug traffickers while expanding treatment options for those addicted to deadly drugs is effective. Ridge said it was: “I think it’s the right strategy.”

“It’s supply and demand,” he explained. “Supply: you go after those who push out the subscription—the docs that over-prescribe. You go after the labs. You go after the foreign sources. You go after the supply.”

“On the demand side? You have to intervene,” he continued. “You have to try to help. You have to try to rehabilitate. And some of these efforts are going to be successful—some are not. But simply talking about supply isn’t enough. And so, any effort that the government, both the state and the federal government, can do to support families and to support the kind of medical, necessary intervention—I think it’s critically important. You have to have to have it.”

“It’s a supply and demand problem. You have to attack both,” he added.

Ridge also added that a suspect in New Jersey had been arrested with 30 pounds of fentanyl. “We worry about weapons of mass destruction,” he said. “But I think 30 pounds of fentanyl in the wrong hands is a weapon of mass destruction.”

Ridge pointed to a Breitbart News story explaining that more Americans had died from opioid overdoses in 2015 than they did of gun violence: “It’s about time we got serious. So, yes, the question of supply, yeah, let’s cut it off and demand—let’s try to get some intervention and reduce the demand.”

According to the CDC, “prescription opioids in the U.S. nearly quadrupled from 1999 to 2014,” although a former federal prosecutor claimed painkiller and heroin addictions should be classified as “distinct” from one another.

An Associated Press report revealed that drug wholesalers shipped roughly 780 million prescription painkiller pills to West Virginia alone in only six years, or 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in that state. The report also stated 1,728 West Virginians fatally overdosed on painkilling pills in those six years. “Distributors have fed their greed on human frailties and to criminal effect. There is no excuse and should be no forgiveness,” a former pharmacist said about the painkillers’ death toll.

President Trump’s budget blueprint pledged to commit some $675 million to combat drug trafficking, help lift opioid abusers out of addiction, and prevent more Americans from succumbing to the the narcotics epidemic.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1c075a4b:11d2e7:cfb784e9</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Wednesday at the White House press briefing CNN’s Jim Acosta asked if President Donald Trump was “detached from reality” because of comments the president made at a White House gathering for Senators on Tuesday night.

Acosta questioned Trump saying U.S. soldiers in Iraq were fighting “like never before,” and that passing health care reform would be “easy.”

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the comments were a “light-hearted moment.”

Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused White House press secretary Sean Spicer of sexism Tuesday during a speech in San Francisco.

Speaking in front of thousands of women at the Professional BusinessWomen of California, Clinton — though never mentioning Spicer’s name — accused President Trump’s chief spokesman of patronizing a press corps member.

“Just look at all that has happened in the last few days to women who were simply doing their jobs,” Clinton began. “April Ryan, a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity, was doing her job just this afternoon in the White House press room, when she was patronized and cut off trying to ask a question.”

The former Secretary of State was referring to a heated exchange between American Urban Radio Networks White House correspondent April Ryan and Spicer over the various investigations plaguing the Trump White House.

Clinton also accused FOX News host Bill O’Reilly of “racism,” after the cable anchor said California congresswoman Maxine Waters’ hair looks like “James Brown’s wig.”

“One of your own California congresswomen, Maxine Waters, was taunted with a racist joke about her hair,” Clinton said. O’Reilly has apologized for the comment.

Decrying the daily workplace “indignities” women, “especially women of color,” endure, Clinton urged the room full of women’s business leaders to “Resist. Insist. Persist. Enlist.”

Al Gore has issued a devastating riposte to President Trump’s Executive Order on Energy: he has unleashed the trailer for An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power.

Unlike its creaky predecessor – basically an extended powerpoint lecture featuring crap animations of drowning polar bears and a fat, sweating, failed presidential candidate in a suit clambering up onto a hydraulic elevator to make some tendentious, whiney point about a graph – this sequel uses shock, awe and spectacular footage to bludgeon its audience into submission.

A maelstrom of brown, boiling floodwaters, calving glaciers, burning mountainsides and lashing tornadoes, Gore’s production team have pulled out the stops to create a propaganda movie so lavishly convincing it makes Triumph Of The Will look like Snakes On A Plane.

At the heart of the movie is Gore himself – whose caring, nurturing, brow-furrowed sensitivity as he travels the world’s weather disaster zones to marvel at the damage done by man’s selfishness, greed and refusal-to-amend-his-lifestyle (TM) is contrasted with the smirking evil of the movie’s arch-villain, Donald J. Trump. Trump, of course, represents the “Power” to whom the heroic Gore figure is speaking “Truth.”

What is clear, though, even from the two-and-a-half-minute trailer, is that among the things left behind on the cutting room floor are science, integrity, and credibility.

There is, for example, absolutely no evidence that man-made carbon dioxide has produced an increase in extreme weather events. In fact tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, bitter winters and extreme precipitation have all either remained much the same or reduced since “global warming” began.

So what Gore is doing here, in other words, is misleading his audience with weather horror porn of extreme events which have nothing at all to do with climate change.

As for the prominently featured wind turbines and solar arrays – these are a blatant attempt to push the expensive, environmentally damaging, inefficient renewables to which green shysters like Gore are ideologically committed but which will make no difference to climate change. Their sole purpose is to enrich, at taxpayers’ expense, a few of the rent-seekers, troughers, crony-capitalists and other charlatans who are leeching off the back of this disgusting $1.5 trillion per annum scam.

Follow the money: this is the real reason Gore has made this movie. And it’s the reason there has been such squealing objection to President Trump’s (actually quite disappointingly modest) attempts to take on the Climate Industrial Complex.

Still, you can tell Trump is headed in the right direction from the kind of people who are attacking him.

NBC published an article titled “Trump Now Uses an iPhone — Despite Once Calling for an Apple Boycott” to attack the president for switching from his potentially vulnerable Android handset to an iPhone.

The article begins by directly stating that the reason for President Trump’s switch to the Apple-made handset is for security reasons: “President Donald Trump is finally using an Apple iPhone, despite once calling for a boycott of the company’s products, after concerns that the Android handset he was reportedly using was unsecured.”

“A number of reports have suggested Trump was using a Samsung Galaxy S3 running Google’s Android operating system, a point which has never officially been confirmed,” the article notes. “The New York Times reported in January that the phone was unsecured. This means that it is vulnerable to hackers, something of great concern because the president of the U.S. would be a key hacking target.”

The article then focuses on Trump’s use of the more secure Apple device, citing the president’s past criticism of the iPhone manufacturer for refusing to unlock the phone of San Bernardino terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook. “During a campaign rally last year, Trump called for people to boycott Apple products because the technology giant refused to unlock the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shootings. In this case, the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the order “chilling” and did not assist.”

“During a campaign rally last year, Trump called for people to boycott Apple products because the technology giant refused to unlock the iPhone involved in the San Bernardino shootings,” NBC notes. “In this case, the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone belonging to the San Bernardino shooter. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called the order ‘chilling’ and did not assist.”

President Trump, of course, has in the past used the products of many companies with whom he disagrees, directly naming Coca-Cola at one point in a tweet.

The Coca Cola company is not happy with me–that&apos;s okay, I&apos;ll still keep drinking that garbage. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2012

President Trump’s decision to use a more secure mobile phone seems to be a step in the right direction considering the issues surrounding cyber security that were raised during the election. However, NBC appears to cast President Trump’s decision to better protect himself from cyber attacks as a sign of hypocrisy.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1b992ea5:6ef0b:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin III praised President Donald Trump’s reversal Tuesday of President Barack Obama’s “Clean Power Plan,” which created a regulatory regime that targeted the coal mining industry and coal-fired energy plants.

“Since I was governor, I have fought against unnecessary bureaucratic regulations that harm our way of life with no regard for the catastrophic economic impacts they have on West Virginians,” said the only Democrat to stand and applaud during the president’s joint address to Congress.

“We need to strike a balance between the environment and the economy. The Clean Power Plan never achieved that balance. Rolling back this regulation is a positive step towards preventing further job loss, increases to consumer energy bills, and more damage to our economy,” he said.

“We must stop ignoring the damage these regulations caused our energy sector, our economy and our way of life in West Virginia,” the senator said.

The president touched on the human side of what he called the War on Coal in his remarks Tuesday after signing the executive orders.

I actually, in one case, I went to a group of miners in West Virginia — you remember, Shelly — and I said, how about this: Why don’t we get together, we’ll go to another place, and you’ll get another job; you won’t mine anymore. Do you like that idea? They said, no, we don’t like that idea — we love to mine, that’s what we want to do. I said, if that’s what you want to do, that’s what you’re going to do. And I was very impressed. They love the job. That’s what their job is. I fully understand that. I grew up in a real estate family, and until this recent little excursion into the world of politics, I could never understand anybody who would not want to be in the world of real estate. (Laughter.) Believe me. So I understand it. And we’re with you 100 percent, and that’s what you’re going to do. Okay?

The “Shelly” Trump was calling out was Senator Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV), Manchin’s fellow senator from the Mountain State.

Manchin said Trump gets it on coal and the effects of the last administration’s approach towards coal.

“This step by the administration recognizes that the Clean Power Plan went beyond the bounds of EPA’s authority, instead of working against us and imposing self-inflicted economic wounds like the last administration,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1b7d8ec0:40b27:afcb5334</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Civil rights and advocacy groups are asking California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to investigate schools around the state that are asking for students’ Social Security numbers and trying to ascertain their immigration status.

The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area and California Rural Legal Assistance claim such an approach has a “chilling effect” on the learning environment and can cause parents to be hesitant sending their kids to school in the first place.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, questions about Social Security numbers and immigration status “have been on school enrollment forms for years,” but the line of questioning is viewed in a new light because President Trump’s focus on enforcing border laws and deporting dangerous illegal immigrants.

Becerra was asked to investigate 75 schools in total.

This is just one more way in which California has sought to distance itself from Trump’s immigration policies.

On December 6, 2016 – -over a month before Trump was even inaugurated — amnesty groups fought to hide California’s gang database from Trump. The reason was that activists supposedly feared that the Trump administration would peruse the list, find illegal immigrants with a violent criminal record and have them deported. After that, San Francisco officials — including the Mayor, police chief, and sheriff — pledged that they would not enforce federal immigration law, despite President Donald Trump’s executive order to that effect.

That was followed by the San Francisco Police Department’s announcement that it would no longer work side-by-side with an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, out of apparent concern that doing so would mean enforcing Trump’s new immigration policies.

President Donald Trump hosted a bi-partisan group of 61 U.S. Senators and their spouses to the White House for a reception, promising to work with both parties to find a solution for health care.

“I know that we’re all going to make a deal on health care,” he said during a speech at the reception. “That’s such an easy one. So I have no doubt that that’s going to happen very quickly.”

At this point, there are no specific plans for a deal, but White House aides have signaled that the president is reaching out to Democrats.

The cocktail reception was hosted on Tuesday night by First Lady Melania Trump and featured a performance from The United States Army Chorus and The United States Marine Chamber Orchestra.

Trump outlined a series of priorities that he wanted to achieve as president, including more spending on infrastructure and the military.

Sixteen Senate Democrats joined the reception, including Dick Durbin, Joe Manchin, and Diane Feinstein.

Trump said he hoped that Democrats could join Republicans to achieve some of the goals he had set for the country.

“We want greatness for this country that we love. So I think we’re going to have some very good relationships,” he said.

Trump singled out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the audience. “Right, Chuck? I see Chuck. Hello, Chuck,” he said as the crowd laughed.

“I think it’s going to happen,” Trump continued. “Because we’ve all been promising — Democrat, Republican — we’ve all been promising that to the American people.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1af3a6d2:3d95e5f:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Actor Richard Dreyfuss says he made a mistake in voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016, but that didn’t mean he had nice things to say about President Donald Trump.

In an interview Tuesday on Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto, the Oscar-winning actor and star of the new FOX show Shots Fired said he did vote for Clinton “and I regret it.”

“Because Hillary is too much of a bought-and-paid-for Wall Street…” Dreyfuss explained, trailing off.

When asked about tax reform and the president’s proposed defense budget spending increases, Dreyfuss replied by calling Trump an “idiot” who should not have been elected president.

“I think he’s an idiot. I think that Donald Trump is not the one to be trusted about any of the details,” Dreyfuss said, adding that Trump is “something, like with a big funny nose.”

“Donald Trump, regardless of his party, lacks simple common decency and he should not be in the presidency,” the actor said referring to Trump’s rhetoric toward his Republican rivals during the presidential campaign.

On policy, Dreyfuss says he believes healthcare is “a right and not a privilege.” Asked if he is willing to subsidize a single-payer healthcare system, he answered, “Of course, because we talk about taxes always as if they’re such a negative thing, and sometimes there is a gesture of support of sharing that taxes are a gesture that says we are a community.”

Last year, Dreyfuss enraged his Hollywood contemporaries after a photo of him and Republican candidate Ted Cruz talking at a campaign event surfaced online.

When President Donald Trump suggested last month that the reported rise in antisemitism might have been due to hoaxes, the media were outraged.

When Trump rejected — angrily — the premise of a question posed by a (sympathetic) Jewish reporter who asked Trump what he was going to do about antisemitism, that was treated as evidence of his guilt. And when he condemned antisemitism, it was not enough for Democrats, who are still alleging that he is to blame.

Last week’s arrest of a Jewish teenager in Israel, with dual citizenship in the U.S., proved that much of the antisemitic outbreak was, in fact, fake news.

Though there has been a surge in anti-Jewish rhetoric and imagery online, and there has been some vandalism at synagogues and cemeteries, the bomb threats that caused the media sensation were not carried out by white supremacist Trump supporters, but an African-American left-wing journalist and the Israeli teen.

Indeed, it is now impossible to know whether the few real incidents of antisemitism were part of a surge, or part of the low level of “background” antisemitism that persists, sadly, even in the U.S., the most tolerant country in the world.

Evelyn Gordon of Commentary magazine — a publication founded by the American Jewish Committee, with a strong interest in Jewish affairs — adds an additional dimension to the story, noting that the teenage culprit was primarily interested in media coverage of the threats.

Where the media ignored the bomb threats, he gave up and moved on to other areas; where the media reported them, he launched threats against similar targets to amplify the public outrage.

Gordon notes that the politically-motivated reactions of left-leaning Jewish institutions and the mainstream media made the outbreak worse:

For most of the last two years–during which he threatened targets like shopping malls and airlines, as well as Jewish institutions in countries like Australia, New Zealand, and America–his threats produced little media coverage, so he didn’t repeat them. But after Trump’s election, he suddenly hit pay dirt. Threats against U.S. Jewish institutions fit right into the American Jewish community’s loudly proclaimed narrative that the election had empowered right-wing anti-Semites, epitomized by Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt’s ludicrous assertion that U.S. anti-Semitism was now at a level unseen since 1930s Germany. Moreover, such threats fit right into the broader left-wing narrative that Trump’s election had empowered white supremacists, racists and other right-wing hate groups. Consequently, whereas anti-Semitic acts received little media coverage during President Barack Obama’s tenure, they suddenly began receiving massive media attention following Trump’s election–not just in America, but worldwide.

Gordon concludes: “The anti-Trump hysteria actually encouraged the very attacks it was meant to combat.” And she makes one additional, crucial point — namely, that the threats began under President Barack Obama, but it was President Trump who took them seriously enough to investigate them, and to stop them:

The Israeli police sources told Haaretz that even though the bomb threats had gone on for two years and several different countries were involved in the investigation, until recently, capturing the perpetrator wasn’t considered high priority. What changed that, they said, was Donald Trump. A few weeks ago, he ordered the FBI to make nailing the suspect high priority. … In short, for all the criticism he justly earned for his belated and reluctant condemnations of anti-Semitism, Trump took action to stop it in a way his predecessor never did–a point to remember for anyone who believes that actions speak louder than words.

It is unclear whether the teenager had a political motive. Regardless, Trump has been vindicated. He is owed several apologies — and, more than that, he deserves to be commended.

CNN has published a stinging fact check of the Trump Administration, exposing several falsehoods in a joke that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made Tuesday about salad dressing.

During the afternoon’s White House press briefing, Spicer made a quip about conspiracy theories that U.S. President Donald Trump is an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin — recruited via blackmail in 2013 — and how the professional journalists who believe this conspiracy might add consumption of “Russian dressing” to their pile of circumstantial evidence.

Case closed? Hardly. CNN’s Michelle Krupa dug deep and found that ACKSHUALLY, Russian dressing has no direct connection to the country that hacked our election. Krupa penned a fact check headlined “Russian dressing is actually from Nashua, New Hampshire”:

“If the President puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight, somehow that’s a Russia connection,” Sean Spicer said. Thing is, Russian dressing isn’t Russian. (Also, it’s really not for salads, but more of a sandwich spread — usually a Reuben.) The mayo and ketchup concoction — often dressed up with horseradish and spices — was created in Nashua, New Hampshire.

This is not the first literal-minded fact check of Trump or his administration, but it could end up in the hall of fame — along with these winners from Krupa’s peers:

• Both CNN and NBC News called BS in the second presidential debate of 2016 after Trump said that Hillary Clinton “acid washed” her email server — for, instead of literally washing the device with acid, her tech team merely used a program called “BleachBit” to delete the server’s data.

• The Associated Press “fact checked” Trump’s opinion that actress Meryl Streep is overrated.

• In the inverse of this phenomenon, PolitiFact has called two statements from Trump “half true” and “mostly false,” even though the articles concede that the claims and numbers he put forward are accurate.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1af3a6d2:3d95e56:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily, SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked guest Frank Gaffney about a post he wrote on the Center for Security Policy blog , in which he endorsed a call by Jeanine Pirro of Fox News for House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign following the failure of the House Obamacare replacement bill.

As he wrote in the post, Gaffney stipulated that “health care is not my field, by any means,” so he did not mean to criticize the substance of the ill-fated House bill.

“I think what is of concern is that this was a doomed approach,” he said. “Paul Ryan, who is supposed to be helping President Trump get through his agenda in the House of Representatives and the congress more generally, should have known better. He either didn’t, which justifies removal on the grounds of incompetence, or did – in which case I think the argument is that he’s simply not a reliable partner for the president in getting this agenda done.”

“On either grounds, I think that it would be necessary for the country, not just for the Trump presidency but for the country, to have leaders in both the House and the Senate who want to ensure that the president’s projects, the president’s agenda, the president’s promises to the American people – which I think were momentous, not just for health care reform but in so many other respects, including the return to the prospect of peace through strength, which if course is near and dear to my heart, and I think yours Raheem – is going to be a necessary condition going forward,” he argued.

“From a layman’s perspective, from a person who understands as a layman the importance of health care, this seemed to be a statist – well, ‘Obamacare Lite’ it’s been called – approach, when a free market approach seems to be called for,” Gaffney said. “I think that’s what Donald Trump set out to do. That’s what he promised the voters. It’s what I think you could get a majority of the Congress behind, if it is clear that in the process, you’re not going to abandon people who genuinely need health care support.”

“It goes back to kind of the fatal flaws of Obamacare, and just making it a little better at the margins, which is I think, at best, what you could say Ryan was up to. It was clearly unsatisfactory and was, as I say, doomed to fail,” he pronounced.

Gaffney added compliments to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and the House Freedom Caucus for “ensuring that it did fail.”

“I think they’ve done a great service, despite all the brickbats being thrown their way, for President Trump as well as for the country,” he said.

Gaffney conceded that choosing a possible replacement for Rep. Ryan as Speaker of the House was a difficult task.

“I think there are a number of people who could probably command the support of the majority of the House,” he said. “It wouldn’t be for me to pick them. Some have been willing to serve in the past. Daniel Webster comes to mind, he seems to be a very presentable guy. It would be obviously up to him or others in the House to stand for this, if in fact Paul Ryan were to create a vacancy – which I hope he will do.”

Virginia Republican Rep. Dave Brat told reporters in the Speaker’s Lobby just off the House floor Tuesday afternoon that he and other members of the House Freedom Caucus are meeting soon with members of the group of moderates known as the Tuesday Group about reviving the Ryancare bill.

House Freedom Caucus members reached out to Rep. Charlie Dent (R-CA), the chairman of the Tuesday Group, who was involved in the negotiations between members of the House Freedom Caucus and House Republican leadership over Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI)’s American Health Care Act. “We are still working on that,” Brat said.

The speaker pulled the bill from the House floor just before it was going up for a vote after members of the Tuesday Group, usually the speaker’s allies, such as Dent, withdrew support from the bill.

At a Tuesday morning press conference, Ryan said after meeting with the House Republican Conference, without staff in the room, that he was confidant his Ryancare bill could come back.

Brat said that during the previous week’s negotiations the House Freedom Caucus made significant compromises, but its positions were repeatedly misrepresented.

“We were never against pre-existing condition protection,” he said. Similarly, other House Republicans were convinced that the HFC was opposed to allowing children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26 and allowing states to establish risk pools, when both had the support of the caucus.

The main problem, Brat said, was that the House leadership handling the negotiation did not properly track and record changes in position and changes in the actual bill’s language. To correct this administrative flaw, Brat said the House Freedom Caucus is putting its own positions in writing.

“This idea that we can’t get to yes on anything?” he asked the reporters. The former economics professor answered his own question when he told them that getting to yes should not be a problem for any House Republicans, because the House Republicans have voted 50 times to repeal Obamacare, one way or the other.

A Capitol Hill source with intimate knowledge of the House Freedom Caucus’s negotiating posture and proposals told Breitbart News that while the HFC was accused of changing the goal posts, it was the House leadership that was difficult to nail down as to what was agreed to and what was not agreed to.

The source told Breitbart News that it is important to remember that the House Freedom Caucus started at clean repeal, and no replace until after repeal. From there the HFC moved all the way to looking for modifications in the Essential Health Benefits and changes in the insurance mandates in the bill’s Title 1.

Texas Republican Rep. Randy Weber told reporters just a few feet from Brat in the Speaker’s Lobby that the morning meeting with the speaker did not start out as a positive for him or his fellow members of the House Freedom Caucus.

“There was a lot of angst and a lot of unhappiness, much of it was aimed at the Freedom Caucus,” he said.

But the HFC members were there to show that they were part of the team, Weber said. The House Freedom Caucus is the conservative bloc inside the House GOP. Although it does not reveal its membership or its whip count, Breitbart News reporting learned that the HFC had north of 25 solid No-votes against the Ryancare bill.

To pass the American Health Care Act, Ryan needed 216 votes, so with “no” votes coming from the 193 House Democrats, Ryan could not afford to lose more than 21 Republicans.

The chairman of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) told Breitbart News that he promised President Donald Trump he would negotiate in good faith with the House Republican leadership, but at different times in the negotiations, the leadership stopped talking to him. Meadows then reached out to the White House and hammered out the outline of a deal Wednesday night going into Thursday morning. It was at this stage that Ryan’s moderate allies abandoned the bill.

“When Paul Ryan came in, he got a standing ovation,” Weber said. “I sit in the front row–Republicans have got to quit shooting each other, you understand? We stood up and gave him a standing ovation, he’s doing a good job.”

Weber said the speaker told his members that many of them were not happy with the Ryancare bill.

“Nobody got into anyone’s face,” he said. “A lot of members got to vent.”

After the speaker opened up the floor to members, many of them who supported the bill unleashed their anger about the bill being pulled to avoid a loss on the HFC members, he said. “It went about 20 or 30 minutes.”

As the hour got closer to ten o’clock, members started heading back to the Capitol for hearings, but more than a few stayed behind to continue to hash it out with House conservatives, he said.

“About eight or 10 of us stayed, and we said: ‘This is why we held the position,” he said. “Literally, at one point in time, Paul Ryan said: ‘This is instructive. This is what we needed.&apos;”

For the congressmen who stayed behind, it was good to clear the air and for many members, it was the first time they had heard the actual position and reasoning of the HFC, he said.

“I think people got to the point, where they know there’s going to be some give and take on this,” Weber said. “I think people have begun to listen and ponder and calculate exactly the good and the bad in the bill.”

Weber said he believes based on the talks Tuesday morning and continuing among House Republicans, the leadership could bring up the bill soon and it would pass.

Arizona Republican Rep. Trent Franks, another member of the HFC, said the extra time to work on the Ryancare bill will help it go through.

The bill was crafted privately by Ryan with working groups of congressional staffers, selected congressmen, and representatives from the insurance industry. The text of the bill was released without warning March 6 at 6:00 p.m., and had the bill passed 18 days later on Friday, the text would have remained virtually unchanged when it passed through the Ways and Means, Energy, and Commerce and Budget committees.

The House leadership approved changes to the bill March 20, such as changing New York State’s handling of Medicare, adding a work requirement for Medicare, and eliminating Ryancare’s individual abortion tax credit.

Franks said when the House Freedom Caucus demanded more substantive changes to the Ryancare bill, it was not looking to score advantages for its members’ districts.

“We want what is best for the country going forward,” he said.

Friday morning, before the bill was pulled, the House Freedom Caucus was still trying to find a way to get the bill so that its members could vote for it.

“We were in the right direction to say the very least.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has substantially increased military support for the Saudi-led Sunni coalition fighting the Iranian-backed Shiite Houthis in Yemen, countering the growing investment Iran has made in its allies in the war-torn country.

The U.S. decision to boost support for the Saudi alliance comes nearly a month after the Trump administration unveiled a potential plan to form a military coalition with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, and Jordan, as well as Israel to combat their mutual enemy: state-sponsor of terrorism Iran.

According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ):

The Trump administration has significantly increased military support for Sunni Arab states fighting al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias in Yemen, said U.S. and Arab officials, drawing the U.S. deeper into the two-year civil war there. American support now includes greater intelligence and logistical support for the militaries of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, these officials said.

Moreover, the Trump administration is also contemplating resuming the sale of precision-guided weapons to Shiite Iran’s regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia.

“We have a commitment… that they will increase this cooperation,” proclaimed Saudi Gen. Ahmad al-Asiri, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, referring to U.S. support. “If there was a hiccup last year, this was an abnormality.”

Meanwhile, Reuters has learned that Iran is also boosting its military support for the Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have retained control of the country’s capital Sanaa in addition to some areas in the north while al-Qaeda holds territory in the south.

The Saudi-led coalition has primarily focused on fighting the Iran-backed Shiite Houthis, allowing al-Qaeda to expand the territory it controls and the number of fighters under its command.

Reuters reports:

Iran is sending advanced weapons and military advisers to Yemen’s rebel Houthi movement, stepping up support for its Shi’ite ally in a civil war whose outcome could sway the balance of power in the Middle East, regional and Western sources say. […] Sources with knowledge of the military movements, who declined to be identified, said that in recent months Iran has taken a greater role in the two-year-old conflict by stepping up arms supplies and other support.

The notorious Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of elite Qods Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC), responsible for protecting the Shiite country’s interests abroad, participated in a meeting in Tehran focused on the future of Iran’s role in Yemen.

“At this meeting, they agreed to increase the amount of help, through training, arms and financial support,” an unnamed Iranian source told Reuters.

“Yemen is where the real proxy war is going on and winning the battle in Yemen will help define the balance of power in the Middle East,” he added.

While Saudi Arabia and its coalition have primarily focused on combating the Houthis and their allies, militias loyal to the former president of Yemen, the Trump administration is mainly interested in providing support to Sunni alliance members who fight al-Qaeda, which poses a direct threat to America.

“U.S. forces will continue to target [AQAP] militants and facilities in order to disrupt the terrorist organization’s plots and ultimately to protect American lives,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in early March.

“They’ve taken advantage of ungoverned spaces in Yemen to plot, direct and inspire terrorist attacks against the United States,” he added. “We’ll continue to work with the government of Yemen and our partners on the ground to defeat [the organization] and deny it the ability to operate.”

Thomas Joscelyn, an expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (FDD) think tank, recently told lawmakers that some leaders of the Yemen-based Sunni terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) are collaborating with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in their fight against the Houthis.

Nevertheless, the Trump administration has significantly stepped up America’s military efforts against AQAP, targeting the group with more airstrikes this month than any year under former President Barack Obama.

It appears the Saudi-led coalition will have to choose between enhanced U.S. support and its alliance with al-Qaeda.

The Saudi-led coalition has rarely targeted the Sunni jihadist group.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1ad819ec:37630bc:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Democrats are running a smear campaign against House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA), after he revealed last week that members of Trump’s transition team were caught up in “incidental surveillance” targeting foreigners.

Nunes’ revelation appeared to bolster President Trump’s assertion that the former Obama administration had spied on the incoming president.

But now Democrats are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from investigating what role Russia played in the 2016 presidential elections, and who illegally leaked to media conversations between Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the U.S.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) demanded that Nunes be removed from the intelligence committee altogether.

“Unfortunately, the House Intelligence Committee has come under a cloud of suspicion and partisanship,” Schumer said.

The smear campaign continued Tuesday. The Washington Post said Nunes “abruptly canceled” a committee hearing with former acting attorney general Sally Yates, and suggested it was because the White House did not want her to testify.

But a congressional aide said that Nunes had announced the hearing was merely postponed — not canceled.

The aide said the hearing was postponed in order to hold a closed hearing with FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers first, since so much of their testimony last week could not be discussed during an open hearing.

The aide also said it was postponed before Nunes was made aware the Department of Justice considered part of her testimony to be barred from discussion in a hearing due to presidential communication privilege, and referred the matter to the White House. The White House later said it never objected.

“He’s being vociferously attacked right now by the Democrats because they want to try to undermine his authority in order to further their argument that we need to have a special commission to take charge of the Russia investigation, because they feel like they’ll have more control in that venue than they do being the minority on a congressional committee,” the aide said.

Nunes has said he is staying put. So far, only one House Republican has supported a Democratic bill to create an independent commission — Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC), according to The Hill.

The Democrats’ campaign to get him removed began last week, after Nunes announced he saw evidence that the communications of members of President’s Trump’s transition team were listened in on, and their identities “unmasked” despite protections meant to protect U.S. citizens, and disseminated among U.S. intelligence agencies.

Unmasking refers to identifying Americans incidentally caught up in surveillance of foreigners, which requires senior official approval and if the identity of that person is relevant to national security or a criminal investigation.

Nunes briefed reporters and the White House on what he found before he shared it with other members of the committee, angering Democrats who accused him of trying to provide cover for the president.

Democrats have also seized on a visit Nunes made the day before his announcement to a facility on the White House grounds, to suggest he was doing something inappropriate.

But Nunes explained Monday on CNN’s “Wolf Blitzer” that he went to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) within the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the West Wing, in order to view intelligence widely distributed throughout the executive branch, but unavailable to members of Congress.

“The Congress has not been given this information, these documents. And that’s the problem,” he told Blitzer. “It was distributed widely through the executive branch.”

He said the reason it was unavailable to members of Congress was because it had nothing to do with the Russia investigation that members were conducting, but was related to his previous efforts to know whether the identities of Americans were being properly masked in intelligence reports.

“So, I had been working this for a long time with many different sources and needed a place that I could actually finally go, because I knew what I was looking for and I could actually get access to what I needed to see,” he said.

“This had nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do with the Russian investigation, there was no way for the folks that I had been working with to actually, to bring this forward to light. There was no way I could view that, because they couldn’t get it to the House Intelligence Committee,” he said of his sources.

Nunes scoffed at reports that characterized him sneaking off to the SCIF the night before.

“The sun was out. And I actually stopped and talked to several people along the way. Many foreign dignitaries were there. Some I recognized, I said hello, had conversations with them,” he said.

He also said he was “quite sure” that no one next door at the West Wing even knew he was there, and that he was not planning to share what he learned with the White House.

However, he said he briefed the president the next day because what he saw had nothing to do with Russia, but with individuals’ names being included into intelligence reports.

“I was very concerned and I thought the President of the United States should know,” he said. “And that’s why I went and told him.”

Nunes said the intelligence he saw showed unmasking of individuals between November through January. He said so far, only Flynn’s name was illegally leaked to media, but he’s not sure yet about others.

Nunes said from what he saw, the unmasking appeared unnecessary.

“As somebody who supports our national security apparatus, it bothered me that this level of information would be included in intelligence reports, because it just wasn’t necessary, from my point of view, legal or not,” he said.

As some reports have mentioned, it would have been normal for Trump transition aides to speak with foreign governments. According to a March 23 Reuters report:

A U.S. government source said it was logical, if not normal, that communications from Trump aides would have been incidentally intercepted by U.S. agencies after his election, given that they would have an interest in talking to foreign governments. Trump took office on Jan. 20.

Decorated former Central Intelligence Agency career officer Gary Berntsen told Breitbart News in an interview that he is sympathetic to Nunes having to visit an executive branch facility to view specific intelligence.

He said contrary to popular belief, members of the intelligence committees don’t have access to whatever intelligence they want, and that it makes sense that Nunes had to view it at an executive agency SCIF.

“They don’t have full access,” he said. “They have more access than other members, but their view is limited.”

He explained that members of Congress typically get “finished intelligence,” not raw data or operational traffic.

“I am a little bit sympathetic,” he said. “He’s trying to do his best to figure it out.”

On March 15, Nunes and Schiff requested the FBI, CIA, and NSA to submit the number of times Americans’ identities have been unmasked, and what procedures are used to determine when to unmask and disseminate those identities.

A deadline of March 17 has passed, and only NSA has provided some information, but the committee is still waiting for answers.

“What I’m raising here is vital to national security. We cannot allow Americans’ names to be either masked improperly or unmasked improperly. And we have a duty and a responsibility to get to the bottom, to see if this was done properly or not,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1aa0e863:36fe21d:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

No White House staff members will attend the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in “solidarity” with President Trump, according to a statement from the White House Correspondents’ Association.

Trump is the first president to skip the event since former President Ronald Reagan in 1981, who was recovering from being shot in an assassination attempt.

Trump announced on Twitter that he would not be attending the dinner on April 29, where awards are presented to journalists and scholarships are given to students.

I will not be attending the White House Correspondents&apos; Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017

“I will not be attending the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!” Trump wrote on Twitter in February.

The question remained whether other White House staff would attend in his place, since typically the White House press secretary sits along with WHCA members, the president, and the first lady.

WHCA President Jeff Mason said the board “regrets” the decision of White House staffers to skip the event.

“We have worked hard to build a constructive relationship with the Trump White House and believe strongly that this goal is possible even with the natural tension between the press and administrations that is a hallmark of a healthy republic,” Mason said. “We made clear in our meeting tonight that President Trump, Vice President Pence, and White House staff continue to be welcome to join us at this dinner.”

Politico reported that there will be no Secret Service protection or security for any dignitaries that show up at the dinner because the president will not be attending.

Mason said the hotel and the WHCA would provide security in place of the Secret Service.

No entertainment has been announced for the event yet either. In previous years, the entertainment for the event was announced in February. Late-night host James Corden reportedly turned down an offer to be the comedian for the night’s entertainment, and there is the possibility the association will decide not to have a comedian or any entertainment at all this year.

“I don’t have anything to update on that but, stay tuned, it shouldn’t be too long now,” Mason said.

Several media outlets have canceled their parties for the correspondents’ dinner, including Vanity Fair, the New Yorker, TIME, People, and Bloomberg.

Full Frontal host Samantha Bee announced in January that she is planning an alternative the dinner where she plans to “properly roast the president.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1aa0e863:36fe217:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an interview with Breitbart News, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu denied that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had shut down any media outlets in the country, claiming the widespread police raids against media outlets were the product of judiciary orders.

Çavuşoğlu sat down with Breitbart News for an exclusive interview at D.C.’s National Press Club last week.

“Free press is definitely necessary for democracies and democratic societies,” Çavuşoğlu said, noting that the media must be held accountable for their reporting. “Press should be also, at the same time, much more responsible and they should tell the truth,” he said.

Both U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan have pushed back against the media’s allegedly biased coverage of events in their nations. Earlier this year, Erdoğan praised Trump for putting CNN reporter Jim Acosta “in his place” during a news conference. Trump told Acosta, “I’m not going to give you a question. You are fake news” in response to an article CNN had published alleging Russia had tried to compromise him.

Unlike Trump and his supporters, however, Erdoğan fans have taken to violently attacking media outlets – the headquarters of the newspaper Hurriyet were attacked twice by mobs chanting “allahu akbar” – and Erdoğan’s police forces have stormed and shut down broadcasters for alleged ties to terrorism.

Al-Monitor previously reported that the Cumhuriyet Daily’s editor-in-chief “Can Dundar and Ankara representative Erdem Gul landed behind bars Nov. 27 for reporting that Turkish intelligence shipped weapons to radical Islamists in Syria. Though they were released three months later, they eventually received jail terms for revealing state secrets.” The piece titled “How Erdogan Became Turkey’s Biggest Media Boss” also reports that 85 percent of Turkey’s remaining news channels are state-owned.

“Unfortunately, the press is taking sides, and the role that press is playing in Western countries is not very constructive,” Çavuşoğlu told Breitbart News. He added his belief that the leftist media, especially in Europe, was responsible for “a very dangerous trend” which has taken the continent “back to [the] pre-World War II era.”

Çavuşoğlu also blamed the media for fueling hateful sentiment towards migrants, refugees, Muslims, and Jews among other groups. “Media should tell the truth. This is the main problem, unfortunately; both in your country and also in our region. Nevertheless, free media is essential for democracies.”

Following the failed military coup against Erdoğan’s government last July, Erdoğan’s government shut down over 130 media outlets, arresting many of their highest-ranking journalists. However, on Tuesday, Çavuşoğlu said, “In Turkey, no media outlet or press has been shut down or closed by President Erdoğan. And President Erdogan has no power” to shut media down. Instead, Çavuşoğlu suggested these actions were carried out by independent judiciaries in the country.

Nevertheless, there were some media outlets belonging to Fethullah [Gulen] terrorist organization, and they were involved in the failed coup in Turkey. And they were also involved in many illegal activities including fabricating false evidences against third persons. So those are the media outlets closed by the independent judiciaries in Turkey, not by President. The president has no authority to do so in Turkey.

However, the upcoming referendum vote, taking place on April 16, will likely change that. At one point during the interview, the foreign minister said that Erdoğan has “a lot of power now, no responsibility” but noted that if the referendum vote passes, “the president will be [held] accountable” and that he will be vested with a great deal of responsibility. Çavuşoğlu explained that currently, Turkey does not have a separation of power but between the government and the parliament, but that with the new system, “there will be a clear separation of power.”

Today President Donald Trump visits the Environmental Protection Agency – the snake which he has scotched but which he is sadly a long way from killing.

On SiriusXM Breitbart News Daily this morning Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow asked me why this simple job is proving so difficult for Trump’s appointed EPA chief. Listen to our exchange below:

Well here are 179 million reasons why, courtesy of a Daily Caller investigation.

Six nonprofit groups that criticized President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts failed to mention the nearly $179 million in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grants they’ve received since 2009, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group (TheDCNF) analysis of federal spending data. The agency has funded thousands of such groups since former President Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration, but TheDCNF focused only on six of the largest nonprofit recipients in its analysis of grant data compiled by the watchdog Open The Books.

But if you had to limit yourself to just one reason, I’d say simply: Jimmy Kimmel.

Which isn’t to say that the amiable liberal chat show host represents the Belly of the Beast of Green Evil. Merely that Kimmel is the perfect example of the kind of person who makes conservatives like Scott Pruitt feel uncomfortable about sounding too hardcore on environmental issues.

Earlier this year, for example, Kimmel sent out this ugly message to his eight million Twitter followers.

Put simply, Scott Pruitt is a piece of shit. If you care about the outdoors, stop him https://t.co/jh4VM7SECx #PruittHearing — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) January 18, 2017

Who wants to be dissed by easy-going, likeable, not-aggressively-political Jimmy Kimmel?

Not Scott Pruitt, clearly. And it’s not who Jimmy Kimmel is that matters so much as what he represents. He’s not one of those perma-campaigning enviro whackjobs like, say, Ed Begley Jr or Leo DiCaprio. He’s more on the lines of the average guy who doesn’t know much about climate change or environmentalism – but who knows a terrible injustice when he sees it and cannot help speaking out because, damn it, the children, the polar bears, the humanity!!!

If you were stupid, ill-informed and only got your opinions from the tainted liberal media – so that’s pretty much half of America – you would no doubt be wholly persuaded by the apparent sincerity and passion of Kimmel’s tweet.

Here’s the problem though. There is absolutely nothing disinterested about that apparently heartfelt opinion expressed by Jimmy Kimmel.

Kimmel is a director of the US environmental charity American Rivers. (Rich celebrities – Kimmel is worth $35 million – love to greenwash their image by prominent association with environmental groups.)

What possible reason, though, could Kimmel have for expressing such violently strong disapproval of the new EPA chief Scott Pruitt?

Oh yeah. Since 2010, American Rivers has received around $2,500,000 in grants from the Environmental Protection Agency. These are just the kind of hand-outs which are likely to dry up now that, under President Trump’s orders, the EPA’s budget has been slashed by $2 billion. Naturally, American Rivers – along with all the myriad other non-profits which were sucking on the teat of the EPA – is none too happy about being denied access to its milch cow.

This kind of cozy arrangement is no accident. As Paul Homewood notes, this is how the environmental movement simultaneously feathers its nest and entrenches its power base – and has done for decades. The European Union, for example, has exactly the same tainted and symbiotic relationship with environmental groups.

With both the EPA and the EU, what we have is state authorities handing out vast quantities of taxpayer-funded cash to left-leaning environmental lobby groups. In return for this free money – hey, it’s only taxpayer money, so what does it matter? – the environmental groups lobby on behalf of their sponsor to argue that it should have more power and be more proactive in the vital realm of protecting the environment.

All these different voices – Jimmy Kimmel on behalf of American Rivers here, the president of the American Lung Association there – it sounds like there’s grassroots support from all walks of life from people across America, all opposed to EPA cuts.

But in fact these free opinions are all bought and paid for.

Of course the American Lung Association doesn’t want the EPA’s budget cut. Since Obama’s inauguration – the ALA and its various regional offshoots – have snaffled a whopping $16.3 million from the EPA.

Similar rules apply to the many hundreds of other non-profits part-funded by the EPA. That $179 million figure cited by the Daily Caller referred to just the top six non-profits part-funded by the EPA. But check out this list of non-profits which have received EPA donations: it just goes on and on.

The Green Blob, as I keep saying, has many, many tentacles. Too many people are owned by it. Too many opinions have been corrupted by it. Too many credulous fools have been brainwashed by it.

Its natural habitat, of course, is a vast and stagnant swamp, where it is heavy protected by large numbers of parasitical creatures dependent on it for their survival.

If Trump hopes to succeed drain that vast mire of corruption, lies and suppurating evil, he may need to drill himself a much bigger hole.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1aa0e863:36fe20d:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Montana Congressman and former Navy SEAL Ryan Zinke did not know what job his newly elected commander-in-chief had for him when he first visited Trump Tower in December with his wife, Lola, for an interview.

“It was 200 shotgun questions,” he said, recalling the moment with the president in an interview with Breitbart News. Trump grilled Zinke on a wide variety of topics such as women in combat, Syrian policy, the rise of China, Indian affairs, pipelines, and energy policies. “It spread the spectrum of subjects,” he said.

Trump raised the possibility of his serving as the secretary of Veterans Affairs, but Zinke declined. But as he left the building, he still did not know what Trump wanted him to do.

“Two days later, I was flying back to Montana and Vice President Pence calls and says, ‘Congratulations.’ The first thing I asked him was, ‘What job?’” Zinke chuckled. He was delighted to hear that he had been selected to serve as the secretary of the Interior.

A New Multiple-Use 100-Year Plan

As a former Navy SEAL, Zinke views himself as the commander of an operation where he is ultimately responsible and wants to make sure that the employees on the ground are empowered.

“This is like assuming a giant command, where my focus up front is the field. My focus is the rangers and the land managers that are on the front line,” he said. “There’s a lot of frustration and dissatisfaction on the front line because they feel like they’re being micromanaged by Washington. They’re feeling like they have a lot of resources pulled back. From a military point of view, it’s the sergeant and the chief on the front line that win wars.”

Zinke outlined plans of a reorganization of the department to shift resources out of Washington, DC, to the front lines, looking forward to the next century of land management. He added that Trump asked him to think big.

“We’re going to reorganize the Department of the Interior for the next 100 years,” he said, citing Theodore Roosevelt’s lofty ambitions.

Zinke has a bust of Roosevelt in his office and an assortment of artifacts from the Department of the Interior’s massive collection. Two paintings feature Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden’s geological survey expedition of 1871. He also keeps a dinosaur skull cast of a Lythronax arrestees (king of gore), a famous modern paleontology discovery in Utah’s Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.

This dinosaur skull is just one of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke&apos;s amazing decorations in his office. Story tomorrow! A post shared by Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) on Mar 28, 2017 at 1:19pm PDT

Mounted on the wall is Zinke’s personally owned head of a buffalo from “the last herd” in 1906 and an elk head killed by former Montana Congressman Ron Marlenee, as well as memorabilia from his life as a Navy SEAL and football souvenirs. Zinke played college football for University of Oregon, where he got his degree in geology. In the corner, Zinke has a massive grizzly bear displayed.

Zinke spoke to Breitbart News in his office at the Interior after attending a bill signing in the Oval Office with President Trump, which rolled back the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Planning 2.0 rule. For Zinke, it was one more sign that the president would deliver on his campaign promises.

“We’re going to do exactly what the president has promised the American people he would do,” he said. Zinke is tackling the idea of restoring power to local officials and shifting more power out of Washington. He explained that key component of that mission was restoring trust with the citizens of the United States.

“There is a lot of distrust with some of the heavy-handedness of the government; I would say arrogance,” he said.

Former President Obama designated more than 550 million additional acres of land and water under federal protection and created or expanded 34 national monuments during his administration. Days before he left office, Obama created the Bear Ears monument in Utah, ignoring state and local lawmakers who opposed the decision. He also included millions of marine acres by designating monuments in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and removed offshore resources from development.

Zinke said President Trump would likely focus on managing existing resources before considering his own preservation legacy. In the modern presidency, only Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Richard Nixon chose not to increase the amount of land protected by the federal government. The last president to decrease the amount of acreage was President Dwight Eisenhower.

Trump, Zinke said, was already looking at ways to roll back Obama’s last-minute land grabs.

“I don’t think it’s in dispute whether he can modify a monument,” Zinke said, referring to the president. “The dispute is whether or not he can nullify it — still untested and unclear in the law.”

Zinke also wants to streamline the regulation of federal lands, working to put the Department of the Interior back in partnership with businesses seeking to develop natural resources responsibly. He cited situations where industry “invested in good faith” but had the rules changed at the last minute.

“We’re not going to change the rules midstream to be punitive on your project,” he said.

Making National Parks Great Again

Zinke wants to improve the public image of the Interior by improving the character of the National Parks.

“Our face of the Interior is our parks, and we want to make sure that the park experience this summer is noticeably improved,” he said.

Park superintendents, he explained, would be judged on the cleanliness of the bathrooms in the park, their physical presentation and appearance in uniform, and their friendliness and helpfulness to visitors of the parks.

The parks experienced a record number of visits in 2016, more than 330 million, as the National Park Service celebrated its 100th anniversary.

“It’s all for the benefit and the enjoyment of the people,” Zinke said, citing the engraved slogan in the Roosevelt arch outside the gate of the first national park in Yellowstone.

“We have deviated from that,” he said. “It means that we can protect the environment, but we can’t lose the focus on why the parks were established.”

Many Americans were enraged after they found their parks closed in the wake of the government shutdown of 2015, as the Obama administration physically blockaded the entryways to National Parks and important historical monuments in Washington, DC.

Zinke said he was determined to keep that from happening again.

“Not on my watch,” he said.

Restoring Trust

During the Obama administration, local conflicts over the use of public lands fueled public frustration in Western states. The Bundy clan took up arms against the government on two different occasions, making headlines as they protested an overbearing government bureaucracy.

But Zinke thinks a different attitude from Washington, DC, might prevent that from happening in the first place.

“I would say the war is over with the new president and the administration,” he said. “We want to be the good neighbors.”

He cited the conclusion of the Dakota Access Pipeline protest in February as an example of how the federal government could work together with local officials to enforce the law and diffuse the situation before it got out of control.

“We want to see when we have a law enforcement problem, our first line of defense is the local sheriff,” he said, suggesting that a BLM truck would not be as effective in thwarting people upset with the government.

According to Zinke, local Interior officials should be embedded in the local communities, serving as advocates for the people, rather than just the enforcers on the ground.

“That’s a cultural shift, which I think is absolutely critical to the success of this organization long term,” he said.

Getting Trump Outdoors

Zinke’s biggest challenge might be getting President Trump out to a national park to experience the outdoors. The president, who prefers to spend his time indoors working or meetings on the golf course, has not spent much time experiencing many of the natural beauties of the country.

“We’re going to get him out,” Zinke laughed, when asked about the challenge.

“Roosevelt was from New York,” he added optimistically. Zinke cited Donald Trump Jr.’s love of the outdoors as a positive sign that the members of the family raised in New York City could appreciate the outdoors.

“He’s in good shape. He’s tough. Hopefully, we’ll get him on a horse,” Zinke, with a grin, said about the president. “Give him a Teddy Roosevelt rough rider hat because it fits his personality.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1a855249:3cccb47:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Buoyed by The O’Reilly Factor, Fox News just reported the best quarter in cable television history – better even than the final quarter of 2016, when the presidential race reached its stunning climax.

The O’Reilly Factor was the most-watched cable news show and had the best quarter ever for a cable television news program. O’Reilly averaged nearly four million viewers per night, followed by Tucker Carlson Tonight with 3.3 million, The Five with 3.03 million, Special Report with Bret Baier with 2.95 million, and Hannity with 2.87 million.

Fox News won the ratings battle for the 61st consecutive quarter, according to Nielsen data released Tuesday, and finished on top among cable news networks in total day and prime time viewership.

Fox News appears to be reaping the benefit of a decision it made last fall to move closer to President Trump. With the departure of Megyn Kelly, media observers were watching to see if the network would choose a Trump-friendly person to replace her or move to more moderate ground.

The decision to install “a pro-Trump host” – Tucker Carlson – into the prime time mix signaled the network was “doubling down on its right-wing politics and planning to align itself with the new administration,” wrote Gabriel Sherman in New York magazine.

“Murdoch’s relationship with Trump has greatly improved since the depths of Trump’s battle with Kelly last year,” Sherman wrote. “I really like Rupert Murdoch!” Trump told guests at Mar-a-Lago during the holidays, according to an attendee. “Roger Ailes was a friend of mine, but Fox’s coverage is so much better since he left.”

According to a story in Politico entitled “Trump Gives Cable News a Ratings Boost in 2017,” Fox News said it “broke a network record” for ratings in every hour among 18- to-34-year-old viewers and was the number one-rated network overall and in prime time. The network had a 2.5 rating for the prime time hours, which equated to 2.244 million viewers per hour.

That represented a gain of 27 percent overall in the first quarter of 2016 and 32 percent among the key 25- to-54-year-old demographic.

Cable news viewership was up across the board. Rachel Maddow’s show was the top-rated program in the key 25- to-54-year-old demographic in the 9 p.m.-10 p.m. hour – the first show to win that hour in that demo in the network’s history. It drew more than four million viewers on the night it revealed President Trump’s 2005 tax return but dropped to 2.6 million the next night. In March 2016 versus March 2017 comparisons, her ratings climbed 106 percent.

MSNBC finished fifth among cable outlets with a 1.3 share, slightly more than half that of Fox News. But its ratings represent a gain of 55 percent in total day viewers and 40 percent in the key demographic during the first quarter of 2016.

CNN finished 12th overall with a 1.0 share, its highest rating in 14 years in the prized 25-54 demo and for total audience. Anderson Cooper 360° was its highest-rated show.

Also, MSNBC defeated CNN in Monday-Friday viewers, but CNN bested MSNBC when all seven days were considered.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1a32ab40:3c38e09:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

TEL AVIV – The Trump administration is exploring the option of hosting a summit this summer with Gulf Arab leaders, the Palestinian Authority president and Israel’s prime minister in an effort to jumpstart the moribund Israeli-Palestinian negotiations process, sources told the Jerusalem Post.

Israeli sources who asked to remain anonymous have said that U.S. officials are quietly assessing whether there would be interest in such a conference, the report said.

“The president wants to bring them over – a public event with them,” one senior Israeli source told the Post on Tuesday. “I think it’s feasible, but the question is what happens after.”

The official also said that Arab representatives would only agree to attend the summit if Israel implemented an unofficial construction freeze outside the large settlement blocs.

A large portion of the four-day marathon of meetings between President Donald Trump’s special representative for the Middle East Jason Greenblatt and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief of staff Yoav Horowitz was devoted to discussing a settlement freeze but no final decision was reached, the official said.

Arab world leaders are slated to meet in Washington next month, possibly paving the way to a summit, sources said.

Ahead of this week’s Arab League Summit in Amman, Greenblatt said “the time has come to make a deal.” He noted that Trump believes an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement “will reverberate positively throughout the region and the world.”

In a historically unprecedented move, the proposed summit would include the Saudi leadership at the crown prince level, other Gulf leaders, their Egyptian and Jordanian counterparts and Israelis on the same stage in front of cameras, the report claimed.

However, there are misgivings that such a summit would not have any real effect on policy on the ground.

Some Israeli sources believe that while it would be a positive step for the Jewish state to publicly engage with Riyadh after years of under-the-rug discussions on Iran, such a conference may build unrealistic expectations for the Palestinians that would be untenable in reality.

“It can lead to an intifada if we don’t have a plan for afterwards,” another official said. “Both Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas] and Netanyahu will show up, but neither is likely to come with deliverables.”

However, one senior Trump administration official told the Post the U.S. has no intention of hosting a peace summit. “The administration is concentrating on building relationships with parties in the region,” the official said. “We’re just not contemplating such a conference at this time.”

But Trump’s efforts – even on the public level – seem to indicate interest in such a gathering. His son-in-law and advisor, Jared Kushner, has been in talks with key Gulf leaders on an initiative that would include regional players.

“Trump said at his press conference that he wants a settlements slowdown, and he talked about the outside-in approach using the regionals. So this is not that far of a jump,” one former State Department official involved in Middle East peace issues told the Post. “One plus one equals two.”

Republicans in Washington are warning Trump not to move too fast on any Mideast proposal.

“The timing for a splashy, high-profile, new set of negotiations does not seem to be right,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) told the Post, adding that the stability of the Palestinian Authority was in doubt. “Quiet confidence-building measures might be appropriate.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1a32ab40:3c38e08:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a women’s business group in San Francisco on Tuesday that she has a new, four-word motto: “Resist. Insist. Persist. Enlist.”

Sporting what appeared to be a purple leather pantsuit jacket, Clinton did not mention her former opponent, President Donald Trump, by name. But she did make apparent an reference to his inaugural address, according to Bay Area public radio station KQED: “Where some see a dark vision of carnage I see a light shining on creativity and opportunity.”

In her concession speech in New York on the day after her surprise November 8 loss, Clinton told the country: “Donald Trump is going to be our president and we owe him an open mind and a chance to lead.” However, several weeks into his presidency, Clinton has changed her tune and appears to be warming up to the hostile mood of the Democratic Party base (and the media) in calling for a vigorous “resistance” to the 45th president, his appointees, and his policies.

In San Francisco, before an audience of thousands at the Professional BusinessWomen of California (PBWC), Clinton applauded the failure of the American Health Care Act, which Speaker of the House Paul Ryan withdrew on Friday. But she added, according to KQED, “the other side never quits. Sooner or later, they’ll try again. We will have to fight back twice as hard. Not for the sake of politics, but because these are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction.”

Clinton remains an influential leader within the Democrats Party, although her campaign was accused of alienating supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and many in the party’s dominant “progressive” wing want her family’s influence moved aside in favor of new and more aggressive leaders.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Central European University said Tuesday that government-proposed amendments to Hungary’s law on higher education “would make it impossible to continue its operations” in Budapest, its home for over 25 years.

University President and Rector Michael Ignatieff said in a statement that the closure of the school founded by U.S. billionaire George Soros “would damage Hungarian academic life and negatively impact the government of Hungary’s relations” with its neighbors, its fellow European Union members and the United States.

The university, most of whose nearly 1,800 students are Hungarian, said provisions in the draft bill submitted to parliament by Zoltan Balog, the minister who oversees education, are specifically meant to damage the school. They include an obligation for CEU to open a campus in New York state, where it is also accredited, allowing it to award degrees accepted both in Hungary and the U.S.

The proposed amendment would also eliminate a waiver allowing academic staff from non-EU countries to be employed at the university without a work permit and force the institution to change its name.

Ignatieff proposed talks with the government to find “a satisfactory way forward that allows CEU to continue in Budapest.”

“We will defend our achievements vigorously against anyone who seeks to defame our work in the eyes of the Hungarian people,” he said.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban is a former Soros scholarship recipient, but he has been increasingly critical of the Hungarian-born philanthropist, accusing him of wanting to influence Hungarian politics and supporting mass migration into Europe. The populist Orban is leading a crackdown on migrants.

Orban’s governing Fidesz party says it wants new rules on non-governmental organizations that receive international funding, such as the Soros-supported corruption watchdog Transparency International and the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union.

An early support of U.S. President Donald Trump, Orban is staunchly anti-migration and his government on Tuesday began applying disputed asylum rules allowing the detention in border camps of asylum-seekers, including unaccompanied children over 14.

The government has also been very critical of a recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that awarded compensation to two asylum-seekers from Bangladesh found to have been illegally detained and deported from Hungary in 2015. They are represented by the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, which has also received funds from Soros’ Open Society Foundations.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1a32ab40:3c38dfd:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Monday that for the first time Wisconsin Republican Speaker Paul Ryan is less popular in his home state than President Donald Trump, according to a Marquette University Law School poll conducted March 13 to March 16.

In the poll, Trump is viewed favorably by 89 percent of Wisconsin Republicans and unfavorably by six percent of the state’s GOP.

That’s a seismic shift from a year earlier when more Republicans in Wisconsin viewed him negatively than positively. In a state where Trump suffered a big primary loss and clashed repeatedly with party leaders last year, he’s now as popular with GOP voters (83% net favorability) as Gov. Scott Walker, and slightly more popular than Ryan (73%).

The poll also showed that as Ryan’s poll numbers improved with Republicans, ever since he stopped criticizing Trump they have suffered with Democrats and Independents, according to the MJS:

And this warmer phase in the relationship has coincided with notable shifts in Ryan’s polling numbers back home.

The speaker’s overall popularity rating hasn’t changed much. He was viewed positively by 45% of registered voters and negatively by 38% in Marquette’s March poll.

Scandal star Tony Goldwyn hailed what he called Planned Parenthood’s “lifesaving work” for women’s health care in an interview this week, adding that those those who oppose abortion are actually “sabotaging” their “own moral stance.”

Goldwyn, who plays the role of POTUS on the hit ABC show, wore a Planned Parenthood pin to the PaleyFest television festival in Hollywood this week. The actor says pro-life activists are wrong to think putting an end to abortion will save lives.

“There’s been a lot of disinformation about Planned Parenthood and the focus of the lifesaving work that they do for women’s health care,” the actor told Glamour magazine in an interview, adding:

“I saw a much-publicized image of all those white men sitting around in a room at the White House talking about what should be done about women’s health care, and I thought I would step up [by wearing this and speaking out]. If Planned Parenthood is defunded, millions of women, particularly women struggling economically, are going to be in serious trouble. And the truth is, there will be far more abortions performed—and unsafe ones as a result. The people that are antiabortion actually are sabotaging their own moral stance by taking this position.”

Glamour writer Jessica Radloff praised Goldwyn for his support of the abortion giant, and also cited Planned Parenthood’s already debunked “3 percent” statistic:

“As we’ve pointed out numerous times, abortion constitutes just 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services, and except in cases of rape, incest, or severe threat to a mother’s life, no federal money is used to fund abortion services. But cutting federal funding for PP would put access to breast exams, Pap tests, colposcopy procedures, HPV vaccines, reversible contraception procedures, pregnancy tests, STI tests, and HIV tests at risk.”

Live Action’s motion-graphics video demonstrates how the abortion chain calculates its deceptive “3 percent statistic” by dividing the number of abortions it performs by the total number of services it provides, counting a $10 pregnancy test or a package of condoms as equivalent to a $500 abortion.

“To justify its half billion dollars in taxpayer funding, Planned Parenthood downplays abortion – falsely claiming that it only makes up three percent of its business – and instead plays up its cancer screenings and so-called ‘women’s health care,’” explains Lila Rose, president of Live Action.

Rose adds:

According to its own annual reports, Planned Parenthood does less than one percent of all Pap tests in the United States, less than two percent of all clinical breast exams, zero mammograms, and virtually no prenatal care, yet it does 34.9 percent of all U.S. abortions, killing over 320,000 preborn children every year. Former Planned Parenthood managers have provided testimonials about how the abortion giant uses quotas to push cash-making abortions, doesn’t provide the health care it claims it does, and “treats women like cattle.”

In fact, when President Donald Trump offered Planned Parenthood the opportunity to keep its taxpayer funding if it would stop performing abortions, the group’s officials rejected the offer. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards even tweeted that its abortion services were “as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings.”

Planned Parenthood is proud to provide abortion—a necessary service that’s as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings. https://t.co/TWGOcVjBJ4 — Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 6, 2017

Pro-life activists are urging Congress and Trump to eliminate Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding and redirect it to other community health care centers that provide more comprehensive healthcare services than Planned Parenthood. These community facilities outnumber the abortion business’s clinics by at least 20 to 1.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b18952111:33c0479:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Al Gore is back again to warn about the dangers of climate change in the first trailer for An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, the follow-up to his Oscar-winning 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth.

“Storms get stronger and more destructive. Watch the water splash off the city,” the former vice president and climate change activist warns in the trailer as newsreel footage of severe weather plays in the background. “This is global warming.”

“Despair can be paralyzing,” he adds, “but this, to me, is the most exciting new development. We’re seeing a tremendous amount of positive change. The basis is there. But it’s still not enough.”

The trailer also features several brief excerpts of President Donald Trump’s comments on global warming, and shows Gore delivering lectures and traveling around the world to survey climate-related damage up close.

Inconvenient 2 premiered as the opening night film at the Sundance Film Festival in January, reportedly drawing a standing ovation after the screening from the audience in Park City.

“This movie gives me an extra burst of hope because I think …it really effectively tells the story of how much hope is out there for transforming our energy system to become much more efficient,” Gore said at the screening, according to Variety. “We are going to win this.”

The trailer’s release came the same day President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will roll back several key energy industry regulations signed into law by former President Barack Obama.

An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, with original director Davis Guggenheim returning as executive producer.

Michael Moore sounded a dire warning on his social media accounts Tuesday, exclaiming that March 28, 2017 would be remembered as the day President Donald Trump caused the beginning of the planet-wide extinction of humanity.

In a post to his Facebook page, the 62-year-old documentary filmmaker and liberal activist accused Trump of declaring “war on the planet” after the president signed an executive order Tuesday rolling back several key Obama-era regulations concerning energy production.

“Historians in the near future (because that may be the only future we have) will mark today, March 28, 2017, as the day the extinction of human life on earth began,” Moore wrote on his Facebook page.

“This is a defining moment in the history of mankind. By signing these executive orders today, Trump is declaring an act of war on the planet and its inhabitants,” he continued. “The one silver lining here is that Trump can’t kill the planet; the planet wants to live and has a long history of wiping out any real or perceived threats.”

The filmmaker also warned that the planet was “paying attention” — and would itself dispose of a species “hell-bent on destroying Earth.”

In a statement Tuesday after signing the executive order, Trump said his administration was “putting an end to the war on coal.” The president was joined at the signing by EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Vice President Mike Pence.

“We’re going to have safety, we’re going to have clean water, we’re going to have clean air, but so many are unnecessary and so many are job killing, we’re getting rid of the bad ones,” Trump said.

Moore — who released a surprise anti-Trump documentary shortly before the 2016 election — has become one of the president’s most outspoken celebrity critics. The director has used his social media accounts nearly daily to criticize Trump and comment on political news. In January, Moore vowed to lead “100 days of resistance” against the Trump administration.

Over the weekend, Moore blasted the ultimately unsuccessful GOP bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, calling the effort “anti-woman” and “hateful.”

Last week, he urged Democratic Party to declare a “national emergency” until the FBI could investigate alleged connections between Trump campaign staffers and the Russian government.

The federal appeals court in Richmond has asked Justice Department lawyers and pro-refugee plaintiffs whether the full panel of 15 active judges should accelerate the review of a leading lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s popular Executive Order beginning immigration and refugee reform.

If agreed, the en banc hearing would skip the first stage of the normal process where a case is heard by a panel of three judges prior to any later appeals to the full en banc panel of judges in the appeals court. The judges want an answer to their question by Thursday from both sides.

The request came Monday in a brief announcement, saying: “The parties are directed to file responses to this order, not to exceed five pages, stating their position on the appropriateness of initial en banc review in this case. The responses shall be filed no later than March 30, 2017.”

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit includes five judges nominated by GOP presidents and nine judges nominated by Democratic presidents, including six nominated by former President Barack Obama. One additional judge was nominated by both President George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Not all the judges nominated by GOP presidents are conservative.

However, that leftward tilt in the Fourth Circuit is better for Trump than the California-based Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which is expected to approve another block imposed by a progressive judge in Hawaii.

The Fourth Circuit case emerged from a ruling in Maryland, where a former Democratic official-turned-judge, blocked Trump’s March 6 E.O. 13780, titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.”

On March 15, the federal U.S. District Judge for the District of Maryland, Theodore Chuang, issued his ruling in the case, titled, “International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) v. Trump.” The ruling tried to prevent Trump’s popular decision to bar the arrival of travelers from six terrorism-afflicted countries for 90 days, and also to bar the inflow of refugees for 120 days. Multiple polls show Trump’s immigration reforms are popular.

The Maryland judge also agreed to consider the plaintiffs’ request for an order requiring the President to double the annual inflow of immigrants from 50,000 to 100,000. The request for 100,000 refugees each year was made by lawyers for the International Refugee Assistance Protect, and HIAS Inc., a so-called “VOLAG” which is paid by federal agencies to import refugees, and by members of the Middle East Studies Association.

According to a March 21 report in Breitbart:

“Judge Chuang’s ruling on Trump’s executive order should be viewed as a continuation of his service to the Democratic party, including his role in stonewalling Congress’ investigation of the Benghazi attacks, and to the cause of ‘social justice.’ With judges as unprincipled as Chuang, his Hawaii counterpart, and the leftists who dominate the Ninth Circuit, one wonders whether the rule of law has a future in America,” respected attorney Paul Mirengoff wrote at Powerline Blog: “Chuang came here to work in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department — ground zero for left-wing activism in government. Before that, he clerked for a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — ground zero for left-wing judicial activism. It is the Ninth Circuit, of course, that ruled against Trump’s original immigration/travel order, and that planted the seed for the absurd argument that the order somehow violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. You have to hand it to the leftists. They know how to shop for judges.”

Trump’s decision to reduce the annual inflow of refugees was promised and debated during the 2016 campaign. Based on his promise to the voters, Trump won, much to the distress of progressives.

The law cited by Trump when he announced his Executive Order is Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. The text gives the President near-complete power over who gets into the United States, according to a January 2017 report by Congress’ Congressional Research Service. The critical language declares, at 8 U.S.C. § 1182 (f) that:

Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate

Section 214(a)(1) of the same law says that the “admission of any alien to the United States as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as [the Executive] may by regulations prescribe.”

The President’s authority over immigration is bolstered by Supreme Court decisions. For example, the court declared in its 1950 judgment lawsuit, titled Knauff v. Shaughnessy, that “It is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by [congressional] law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a given alien.”

In 2015, the Court reasserted that judgment, saying in Kerry v. Din, that:

Din attempts to bring suit on [her Afghan husband’s] behalf, alleging that the Government’s denial of her husband’s visa application violated her constitutional rights… In particular, she claims that the Government denied her due process of law when, without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial, it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse. There is no such constitutional right.

The law and the Supreme Court’s rulings prompted a judge in Boston, Mass., to reject another lawsuit the Massachusetts’ government against Trump’s E.O. “Therefore, in light of the ‘“plenary congressional power to make policies and rules for exclusion of aliens,’ … which pursuant to8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), has been delegated to the President, the Court concludes that the [federal] government’s reasons, as provided in the EO, are facially legitimate and bona fide,” the judge declared February 3.

On March 24, a judge in Alexandria, Va., rejected a similar lawsuit by Islamic groups. “The core substantive issue of law, as to which Plaintiffs must establish a clear likelihood of success, is whether [Trump’s Executive order] falls within the bounds of the President’s statutory authority or whether the President has exercised that authority in violation of constitutional restraints,” said the judge, Anthony Trenga.

“[T]he substantive revisions reflected in EO-2 have reduced the probative value of the President’s statements to the point that it is no longer likely that Plaintiffs can succeed on their claim that the predominate purpose of EO-2 is to discriminate against Muslims based on their religion and that EO-2 is a pretext or a sham for that purpose,” said Trenga, who sits on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1826e0f7:386efc4:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Tuesday on MSNBC’s “All In,” Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said of President Donald Trump there was something “wrong” with him and that he did not “deserve to be president.”

Waters said, “Well, first of all, let’s take a look at the campaign, and I’ve said over and over again, I’ve never seen a grown person dishonor a disabled person in the way that he did. He mocked him, and he mimicked him, and I was struck by that. I just thought that that was so inhumane that a president, someone wanting to be president, could not possibly think that way. I don’t like the way he talked about women and grabbing women by their private parts. I don’t like the way that he treated Hillary Clinton and the way that he kind of stalked her in a debate and got in her face and called her crooked. I don’t even like the way he treated some of his own colleagues and so, he came to the presidency with the kind of character and background that made me distrust him or not honor him and not respect him.”

“And, of course, he got the presidency because he was able to get those votes from those few states that put him, made him the winner. And so he’s the president of the United States, people are still talking about he’s going to change, he’s going to become presidential. He has not changed,” Waters continued. “He is not presidential. As a matter of fact, he is worse now than he was in the campaign. And I think that he does not deserve to represent us in the world. We are being disrespected all over the world and if he wants to continue talking about how great Putin is, and how bad the past president was, then I know something’s wrong with this person. And he doesn’t deserve to be president.”

Andrew Restuccia and Alex Guillen report in Politico on the heat President Trump’s EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is taking from conservatives over reports that he successfully urged Trump not to revoke the EPA’s 2009 “endangerment finding,” a far-reaching ruling introduced by the Obama administration that labeled carbon dioxide a dangerous substance in need of broad regulation. Politico notes that among Pruitt’s high profile critics is Breitbart News’s James Delingpole.

From Politico:

A cadre of conservative climate skeptics are fuming about the decision — expressing their concern to Trump administration officials and arguing Pruitt is setting himself up to run for governor or the Senate. They hope the White House, perhaps senior adviser Stephen Bannon, will intervene and encourage the president to overturn the endangerment finding.

…

James Delingpole, a Breitbart News columnist, blasted Pruitt on Monday, arguing he is “more interested in building his political career than he is taking on the Green Blob, insiders report.” Bannon ran Breitbart before joining the Trump campaign last summer.

Delingpole, who first reported that Pruitt advocated against reopening the endangerment finding, even suggested that the EPA administrator should resign.

…

Meanwhile, EPA officials have expressed frustration at the presence of former Washington State Sen. Don Benton, the agency’s White House-assigned senior adviser.

Benton has repeatedly butted heads with Ryan Jackson, Pruitt’s chief of staff. Multiple sources speculated that Benton might soon leave the agency. And EPA is expected to bring in two new communications staffers, the sources said. The agency is eyeing J.P. Freire, a spokesman for Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), as its new communications director and Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman at the American Chemistry Council, as its deputy communications director. Neither Freire nor Bowman responded to requests for comment.

The New York Times reports that the Senate Intelligence Committee will be questioning President Trump’s son-in-law and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner concerning meetings he held with Russian officials close to the Kremlin, including an executive with Russia’s state-owned development bank, who claims he met with Kushner “in his capacity as the then-chief executive of Kushner Companies, his family’s sprawling real estate empire.”

From Jo Becker, Matthew Rosenberg, and Maggie Haberman in the New York Times:

Until now, the White House had acknowledged only an early December meeting between [Russian ambassador Sergey I.] Kislyak and Mr. Kushner, which occurred at Trump Tower and was also attended by Michael T. Flynn, who would briefly serve as the national security adviser.

Later that month, though, Mr. Kislyak requested a second meeting, which Mr. Kushner asked a deputy to attend in his stead, officials said. At Mr. Kislyak’s request, Mr. Kushner later met with Sergey N. Gorkov, the chief of Vnesheconombank, which the United States placed on its sanctions list after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia annexed Crimea and began meddling in Ukraine.

A White House spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, confirmed those meetings, saying in an interview that nothing of consequence occurred and portraying them as routine diplomatic encounters that went nowhere. But Mr. Gorkov, who previously served as deputy chairman of the board at Sberbank, Russia’s largest state-owned bank, said in a statement issued by his bank that he met with Mr. Kushner in his capacity as the then-chief executive of Kushner Companies, his family’s sprawling real estate empire.

…

Mr. Kushner had not yet stepped aside as chief executive of Kushner Companies, which was trying to attract investment for the company’s crown jewel, an overleveraged Manhattan office tower on Fifth Avenue. The company was in the midst of negotiations to redevelop the building with Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese company with ties to the Beijing government.

Make no mistake: the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare, which President Trump had so often promised to do, was a major defeat for his administration.

The beginning of his administration is when President Trump had the chance to accomplish the most. But it’s not looking that way. He has certainly tried but is being thwarted at every turn by leftist activist judges and the RINO establishment.

According to The Hill, “Trump became heavily involved in selling and negotiating the plan, holding at least 17 meetings on overhauling the healthcare system….Those included arm-twisting sessions (in person and on Twitter) with conservative and moderate factions that opposed the plan, as well as invites to the White House bowling alley and a rare personal trip to Capitol Hill. His aides were more than eager to tout ‘The Art of the Deal’ author’s abilities to get people to come to an agreement. ‘He is the closer,’ White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday.”

So what happened? Trump has to take control. Take a page from Obama and clean house. With regard to Obamacare, Trump should take decisive action to salvage the situation now. He should call every GOP congressman into his office and just hammer out a deal.

Here’s the thing: he talks about being a great negotiator, and that may be true. But throughout his career until now, he has been negotiating not with politicians, but with businessmen. We know their motive: profit. Money.

It’s not the same with politicians. Politics is a twisted world, in which power and reelection are the currency in which they trade. The bottom line in business is money, and while money talks for politicians also, the bottom line with these corrupt clowns is not always so easy to discern.

Breitbart News reminded us recently that House Speaker Paul Ryan “was caught on an audio file from October—obtained by Breitbart News and published a couple weeks ago—saying he is ‘not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future.’”

And Trump was relying on him to repeal and replace Obamacare?

Paul Ryan is also out of his depth. Love him or hate him, former House majority leader Tom DeLay knew how to herd those cats. That’s why the left had to destroy him. Ryan lacks what DeLay had: “bold aggressiveness and quiet maneuvering.”

Ryan has got to go. James Comey, too. What’s with all the Obama holdovers throughout the Trump administration? The Justice Department’s civil rights division must be purged. What’s Eric Treene still doing there? In January 2012, after receiving a huge box (in response to my Freedom of Information Act request) full of documents relating to the Justice Department’s interactions with Muslim groups linked to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, I wrote:

Even more striking was the servile demeanor of the Civil Rights Division official Eric Treene, Special Counsel for the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, and the demanding condescension of Muslim Brotherhood operatives. Muslim and Arab operatives treat Treene and Co. like an errand boy, asking them for email addresses of other contacts and setting them to perform the most menial gofer duties. The DOJ even takes lunch orders and picks up the tab, and in some cases asks them how much money they need for a little soiree they’re holding. It is astonishing.

Yet Treene is still there, and doubtless still kowtowing. And he is not the only one. A senior Trump administration official said last week: “We have members of the former administration at the highest levels who through their actions after January 20 have demonstrated their refusal to recognize the results of the general election. They have pursued, organized, and managed a comprehensive subversion of the new administration.”

The Washington Free Beacon reports that “in one instance, Trump administration officials found evidence that the administration’s executive order banning travel from certain Muslim-majority nations had been selectively altered to bring it more in line with Obama-era talking points. Several hours before the orders were set to be signed by Trump, officials noticed that language concerning ‘radical Islamic terrorism’ had been stripped from the order and replaced with Obama-era language about countering violent extremism. West Wing staffers quickly scrambled to rewrite the order to bring it back in line with Trump’s rhetoric.”

That’s unconscionable. Whoever did that should have been immediately identified and fired.

It’s not too late for Trump. But it will be soon if he doesn’t remember what got him elected in the first place, and drain the swamp.

Early on Tuesday rumors began circulating that President Donald Trump was in talks with the Washington Nationals to throw out the first pitch on Opening Day this month. But, it appears the White House has decided to turn down the invitation.

According to a Politico report, the White House made plans with the DC-based team to take the mound for the ceremonial first pitch in the Opening Day game against the Miami Marlins. The report came from Luke Russert, who heard about the discussion from his perch in Florida.

But, before end of day, others began reporting that the White House already put the kibosh on the plan.

Washington Post sports columnist Barry Svrluga took to his Twitter account to report that Trump won’t be tossing that first pitch after all.

Nats say the White House has declined invitation for President Trump to throw out ceremonial first pitch Opening Day. — Barry Svrluga (@barrysvrluga) March 28, 2017

The Donald has done some throwing in the past. In 1992 he and then-girlfriend Marla Maples appeared at Pilot Field in Buffalo to toss the pigskin around. He looked pretty good doing it, too.

American Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced Monday that her country and a list of nearly forty others would not participate in a meeting to pass an international nuclear weapons ban, calling the proposal “naive” and warning that “bad actors” like North Korea would take advantage of it.

Haley’s opposition to a global nuclear weapons ban – which she argues only responsible nations would follow, leaving them vulnerable to attack from rogue states – follows multiple calls from the Trump administration to modernize the American nuclear weapons arsenal.

“You are going to see almost 40 countries that are not in the General Assembly today,” Haley told reporters on Monday. “To ban nuclear weapons now would make us and our allies more vulnerable, and would strengthen bad actors like North Korea and Iran who would not abide by it.”

“There is nothing I want more for my family than a world with no nuclear weapons. But we have to be realistic,” Haley continued. “Is there anyone that believes that North Korea would agree to a ban on nuclear weapons?”

“In this day and time we can’t honestly that say we can protect our people by allowing the bad actors to have them [nuclear weapons] and those of us that are good, trying to keep peace and safety, not to have them,” Haley argued. She argued that those supporting the nuclear weapons ban did not understand the potential negative effect disarming responsible international actors would have and argued that North Korea and Iran would both be “cheering” if such a nuclear weapons ban passed.

The international resolution Haley opposes is the product of the UN General Assembly, which passed the legislation in December calling for the member nations to “negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination,” according to Reuters. Haley argues that such legislation would disarm responsible nations and remove a necessary deterrent for rogue nations who have since acquired some nuclear capabilities.

Instead, Haley argued, the UN should adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty signed in 1968. That treaty conceded that five nations would retain their nuclear weapons – the five member nations of the UN Security Council – while aspiring to contain the spread of nuclear weapons. The treaty does not address nations that have since acquired nuclear weapons, however, like India and Pakistan, and rogue nations like Iran and North Korea. North Korea, The Independent notes, was a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty until 2003 and has since conducted five nuclear tests.

The forty countries opposing the proposed nuclear weapons ban – including the UK and France, among others – stand in opposition to over one hundred countries that have expressed support for the ban. International influencers like Pope Francis have also stated their support for the ban.

Haley’s defense of the American nuclear weapons arsenal is the latest expression of the Trump administration’s support for maintaining a modern, efficient nuclear capability. “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,” President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter in December, before taking office. At the time, Press Secretary-to-be Sean Spicer told reporters his statement meant “the president is going to put our nation’s security and safety first… that’s what every American should understand that he’s not going to be a passive president.”

Trump reiterated his policy to modernize America’s nuclear capabilities in February in a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, after Putin had told reporters in December he did not find anything “unusual” about Trump’s expansion of nuclear policies. Trump reportedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the New START treaty, which caps the number of nuclear warheads both Russia and the United States can maintain and calls for the destruction of much of the current nuclear arsenal. Trump later told Reuters that he believed the United States had “fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity.” “It would be wonderful, a dream would be that no country would have nukes, but if countries are going to have nukes, we’re going to be at the top of the pack,” Trump promised.

Trump’s policy towards nuclear weapons has alarmed America’s communist enemies on the other side of the world. “China won’t pay into Trump’s protection racket. It should use the money to build more strategic nuclear arms and accelerate the deployment of the DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile,” the alarmist state propaganda newspaper The Global Times wrote in December, following Trump’s tweet calling for improved nuclear weapons. North Korea’s state media has beeneven more belligerent.

This week, the Rodong Sinmun declared North Korea a “non-nuclear state” while threatening a preemptive nuclear strike on America once again. On the UN dispute, Rodong wrote: “The U.S. administration had better lend an ear to the serious advice of the international community that its insistence on the senseless hostile policy toward the DPRK would make it suffer bitter setbacks as its predecessor did.”

Nonetheless, the North Korean state newspaper threatened in a column today that, should America show “even the slightest sign of a preemptive attack on the DPRK, bereft of reason, the powerful nuclear strike means of the DPRK will blow up the bases of aggression and provocation with its-style offensive and preemptive nuclear attack.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b17130982:36db49b:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Amid Democratic opposition, Republican leaders are retreating from President Donald Trump’s very popular campaign promise to build a border fence to block illegal immigration, drug smugglers, and criminals.

A top GOP leader, Sen. Roy Blunt, told reporters on Tuesday that GOP leaders do not want to include Trump’s spending for the border wall in the spring budget, which is due by April 28. “All of the committees, the leaderships of the House and Senate, are working together to try to finalize the rest of the FY17 [budget spending] bill,” he added. “My guess is that comes together better without the [border] supplemental,” he told The Hill. But GOP leaders may include some border spending in a separate 2017 budget for the military, Blunt suggested.

The tacit retreat comes only a few days after GOP leaders staged and lost a fight to push their own business-friendly version of an Obamacare reform, and amid GOP calls for Trump to help pass their hoped-for tax cut.

Top Democrats are hoping to wreck Trump’s presidency by blocking any funding for his key campaign promise. “The wall is a poison-pill rider,” Schumer said in an interview with Politico. “They’ll do it at their peril.”

On March 16, Trump has asked Congress for $1 billion to jump-start border security and to help build the first 62 miles of border barrier in 2017. The overall request was included in the March supplemental request asking for $28 billion for various near-term projects, including $25 billion for the military.

The Democrats’ high-profile opposition to the wall creates a bargaining chip that the establishment GOP can trade to help win its primary goals, such as tax cuts that aid donors and companies.

But the GOP can win any political fight caused by Democratic opposition to the wall, a source told Politico:

A senior Republican source suggested Trump could conceivably win a shutdown fight if he went to the mat to defend it: “This is his signature issue. I cannot imagine a scenario where the Trump administration loses on the border wall funding. If I were them, I’d dare the Democrats to shut down the government over this.”

Numerous polls show that strong majorities of Americans want to reduce the flow of drugs, preserve U.S. jobs for Americans and also want Congress to pass laws that help Americans. In 2006, Congress passed a law authorizing — but not funding — the construction of a border wall.

Politico also reported that another senior GOP senate leader, Sen. John Cornyn, was trying to avoid a Democratic filibuster of the April 28, 2017 budget update by dumping Trump’s request for wall spending.

While no decision has been made by GOP leadership, Republican lawmakers may decide to decouple the two [the wall spending and the April 28 budget supplement] to avoid a confrontation with Democrats. If they do, the chances of getting Trump’s wall funding passed this spring become slim. “It remains to be seen,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) in an interview. “What I would like to see is a plan for how the money would be spent and a good faith discussion about what border security is really composed of. We haven’t had that.” Asked about the prospects for a lapse in government funding, Cornyn was definitive: “There’s not going to be a shutdown.”

Some GOP senators are openly looking for ways to stop Trump’s wall, which is intended to reduce the inflow of cheap labor to employers in their states, along with reducing the inflow of drugs and criminals.

“The border wall is probably not a smart investment,” said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told Politico. In 2012, Graham launched the “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill which split the GOP and helped elect Trump as president.

North Carolina Sen. Tom Tillis is downplaying the wall as he calls for a greater inflow of cheap labor. On March 2, he joined with several lobbyists to suggest that Congress deny funds for construction of a wall or fence along stretches of the border in favor of “other capabilities.” Border security, Tillis said, “is one of the first things we need to do… [but] it seems to me we could get to a reasonable compromise on a bill that I think will be less costly and more effective than just the concept of a structure. Walls need to be where wall are, but other capabilities need to be elsewhere.”

Tillis and Graham both want to hold funding for a wall hostage to approval for new laws allowing more foreign lower-wage contract workers to get jobs sought by Americans at normal wages.

In December, a top ally of House Speaker Paul Ryan outlined the GOP leadership’s strategy to isolate and block Trump’s populist campaign promises, likely including his popular immigration reforms. “Let’s do the things where we agree — let’s do tax reform, let’s do Obamacare, let’s replace Obamacare, let’s start dealing with border security, let’s rebuild our national security and then, on those areas where his agenda is not exactly aligned with ours … then, we’ll figure out the rest in the next six months,” Flores told Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b16f764c7:3717ad3:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump signed legislation Monday that rolls back two Obama-era education regulations — one regarding teacher training programs and another regarding requirements for states in meeting directives of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).

Trump signed H.J.Res. 58, which overturns the U.S. Education Department’s (USED) rule that relates to how teacher training programs are assessed. Additionally, the president signed H.J.Res. 57, which nullifies USED’s rule relating to state accountability requirements under ESSA.

The teacher training program requirement, part of the Higher Education Act, mandated states to rate training programs for teachers each year based, in part, on student outcome measures. The Washington Post describes the Obama rule as “broadly unpopular”:

Teachers unions said the regulations wrongly tied ratings of teacher-training programs to the performance of teachers’ students on standardized tests; colleges and states argued that the rules were onerous and expensive, and many Republicans argued that Obama’s Education Department had overstepped the bounds of executive authority.

The ESSA rule concerned states’ accountability in identifying failing schools and reporting their plans for improving them to the federal government..

In his remarks about these two House joint resolutions, Trump said they “eliminate harmful burdens on state and local taxes on school systems that could have cost states hundreds of millions of dollars.”

“So it’s the states and local-tax school systems, and that was very important,” the president added. “Parents, teachers, communities, and state leaders know the needs of their students better than anyone in Washington by far. So we’re removing these additional layers of bureaucracy to encourage more freedom and innovation in our schools.”

The Republican-led Congress and Trump are overturning some Obama-era rules and regulations via the Congressional Review Act.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b16f764c7:3717ad1:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

MSNBC host Joe Scarborough sent a subtly coded message Tuesday morning to an audience of one: President Donald Trump, you should fire Steve Bannon.

This week, Scarborough has been on a tear against Bannon — a populist firebrand, top aide to the president, and former executive chairman of Breitbart News. The Morning Joe talk show host, twice in the span of three minutes, summed up Bannon’s political philosophy as “Leninist” — that is, wanting to “destroy the American republic.” This meme is based on a quote which Daily Beast author Ronald Radosh, an octogenarian this year, attributed to Bannon based on a conversation that Radosh claims took place in 2013. Bannon said last year that he did not remember either meeting Radosh or having that conversation.

Scarborough linked a poll showing President Trump’s approval at 36 percent to Bannon’s role as White House chief strategist. Trump is stuck at that number, he argued, “because he has simply refused to listen to everybody that has told him you need to reach out and be more inclusive.”

One of the people most responsible for Trump overestimating his support, Scarborough continued, is “our favorite player of the week, Steve Bannon. [in, apparently, a Steve Bannon voice] ‘Oh, they’re going to want me to be Vladimir Lenin and tear down the government because 65 percent of Americans are against us.’ I mean, what idiots.”

“If he wants to get his 36 [percent approval rating] to 56,” Scarborough concluded, “he’s gonna have to fire Steve Bannon and anybody else who calls themselves a Leninist who wants to destroy the American republic and government and start working with Republicans and Democrats and doing what 78 percent of Americans told NBC News a week ago. They want their leaders to compromise and work with the other side and make Washington work again.”

Trump will need to take this warning seriously, given Scarborough’s impressive political chops. He served in the U.S. Congress for the better part of seven years, resigning in 2001 to spend time with his family. For a time, renowned conservative pundit Bill Kristol floated Scarborough as his pick for the 2016 presidential race — eventually settling on a National Review editor who did not run, then settling on a CIA spook-cum-Hill staffer.

As for expanding his populist appeal, the president would do well to seek out Morning Joe‘s invaluable look into “what the smart set in Washington and Manhattan are thinking” every day.

Scarborough’s advice to President Trump has, so far, focused on surrendering to the establishment that has called him a racist/Nazi/tyrant/Russian spy since the start of his campaign:

January 27, 2017: “The press always wins. Washington always wins. You figure out how to work with them or you’re going to get crushed.”

January 31, 2017: “[Trump aide Stephen Miller]’s not good on television, you guys should probably keep him off television.”

February 6, 2017: “I suggest somebody at the White House get him to write a statement – a very strong statement letting the world know that he condemns the assassination of journalists and political rivals.”

February 17, 2017: “Don’t fight the press, the press always wins. Ask Richard Nixon. The press always wins!”

February 28, 2017: Trump should use his Joint Address to Congress to announce “sweeping immigration reform” (i.e. amnesty for illegal immigrants).

March 22, 2017: “Next time a voice inside your head says ‘screw with the FBI,’ just stop.”

Unfortunately, Trump has signaled that he will ignore Scarborough’s tips on appeasing the NY-DC media elite. A few weeks ago, the president’s @realdonaldtrump Twitter account stopped following Scarborough and his partner Mika Brzezinski. Nevertheless, the MSNBC host persists with his invaluable hot takes and armchair governance.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b16f764c7:3717ad0:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A lawsuit brought before a Maryland appeals court seeking to stop President Trump’s temporary ban on new visas from six Middle Eastern countries was filed by a left-wing group financed by billionaire George Soros.

The second group behind the lawsuit was massively funded by the federal government under the Obama administration to resettle refugees within the U.S.

On Monday, Bloomberg reported on the status of the lawsuit:

The Richmond-based appeals court on Monday offered to accelerate its review of the case, which would speed it along to the U.S. Supreme Court by skipping the traditional oral argument before three judges in favor of an initial full-court hearing. The parties have until March 30 to decide if they want that accelerated schedule.

The suit before the appeals court was filed by the International Refugee Assistance Project, HIAS, a refugee resettlement group established in the 19th century to aid Eastern European Jews, the Middle East Studies Association of North America and six individuals.

Similar to the current suit, the International Refugee Assistance Project was also a signatory to a lawsuit filed last January attempting to block Trump’s original executive order halting visas for 90 days for “immigrants and non-immigrants” from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran and Iraq.

The International Refugee Assistance Project is located at the Urban Justice Center.

The Urban Justice Center is also the recipient of an Open Society grant.

Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center’s International Refugee Assistance Project listed in the Trump lawsuit, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros’s Open Society Foundations.

The other group signed on to the lawsuit is the nonprofit HIAS, which describes itself as standing “for a world in which refugees find welcome, safety and freedom.”

Unmentioned in much of the news media coverage about the lawsuit is that HIAS has taken large sums in federal grants to help resettle refugees, as this reporter previously documented .

HIAS specializes in refugee resettlement and in 2015 received 65.3 percent of its annual $25 million budget from government grants.

Annual grants include funds from the State Department and the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services. Another major donor is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

In 2015, the State Department provided $17,663,704 and the Department of Health and Human Services gave another $2,765,195.

The fiscal year 2014 saw a $16,959,850 State Department grant and $2,546,469 in funds from the Department of Health and Human Services.

Guidestar documented that in 2013, HIAS received $16,261,661 from government and intergovernmental agencies and took in a total of $31,218,870 in revenue.

In 2012, $14,707,399 in government grants were donated to HIAS and the organization produced $27,677,240 in revenue.

In 2008, the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations, a division of the UN Economic and Social Council, officially accepted HIAS as an accredited NGO.

HIAS openly states on its website that it is the “only Jewish organization designated by the federal government to undertake” refugee resettlement, which “lies at the heart of HIAS’ work.”

The group is partners with local Refugee Assistance Organizations around the country to “ensure successful integration.”

“Although this can be a long process requiring the participation of many actors, refugees bring the resilience and resourcefulness that saved their lives at home,” HIAS relates.

HIAS was an acronym that previously stood for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and it originally worked to resettle Jewish emigrants from Russia. It dropped the full title and only goes by the acronym now. Mark Hetfield, HIAS president and CEO, told the Washington Jewish Week in December 2014 the word “Hebrew” was exclusionary and outdated, comparing it with the use of the word “colored” to refer to African Americans.

Soros, meanwhile, has reportedly provided some $76 million for immigrant issues over the last decade alone.

In 2014, the New York Times credited “immigrant rights groups” financed by Soros and a handful of other donors with influencing President Obama’s immigration policy.

The newspaper reported:

When President Obama announces major changes to the nation’s immigration enforcement system as early as next week, his decision will partly be a result of a years-long campaign of pressure by immigrant rights groups, which have grown from a cluster of lobbying organizations into a national force.

A vital part of that expansion has involved money: major donations from some of the nation’s wealthiest liberal foundations, including the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Open Society Foundations of the financier George Soros, and the Atlantic Philanthropies. Over the past decade those donors have invested more than $300 million in immigrant organizations, including many fighting for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants here illegally.

In August, Breitbart Jerusalem first reported hacked documents from Soros’s Open Society Institute boasted that the billionaire and his foundation helped to successfully press the Obama administration into increasing to 100,000 the total number of refugees taken in by the U.S. annually.

The documents revealed that the billionaire personally sent President Obama a letter on the issue of accepting refugees.

Netflix’s Grace and Frankie stars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Monday night to riff on some of the legislative setbacks incurred by President Donald Trump’s administration.

“Hanoi Jane” Fonda — who once famously denounced American soldiers as “war criminals” during the Vietnam War — proposed a new business opportunity for Trump.

“Adult diapers that can be called ‘Trumpers,’ to help with all the leaks,” she said.

The duo, who first appeared onscreen together in the 1980 workplace comedy 9 to 5, joined in the Los Angeles-based Women’s March in protest of Trump’s presidency.

“Join us on Saturday! We will not be silent and will stand together. Visit https://t.co/uMTkPDostk for info see you there! #WMLA #whyimarch,” Fonda wrote a tweet that has been deleted.

At the end of their almost ten-minute interview, Fonda called attention to her jacket lapel as she and Tomlin showed Colbert their matching Planned Parenthood pins, in apparent support of the abortion giant.

Fonda was among many stars, including Judd Apatow, and Patricia Arquette, who took part in a star-studded Facebook Live telethon that aired during Trump’s presidential inauguration. The proceeds went toward Planned Parenthood and environmental group Earthjustice.

President Donald Trump made a dramatic display of executive power at the Environmental Protection Agency, as he signed an executive order to begin ratcheting back the Obama-era EPA regulations.

“My administration is putting an end to the war on coal,” Trump said in a speech prior to signing the executive order. Trump was joined by Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.

“Our nation can’t run on pixie dust and hope,” Zinke said during his speech. “The last eight years showed that.”

Vice President Mike Pence was also present for the event.

“President Trump digs coal,” Pence said as he introduced Trump. “The war on coal is over.”

Several coal miners were also present at the event, and at one point Trump left the podium in the middle of his speech to shake all of their hands. “We’re with you 100%,” he said, recalling his campaign promise to put them back to work.

Trump said that his executive order was focused on giving power back to the states and back to the people to restore American energy jobs.

“We’re going to have safety, we’re going to have clean water, we’re going to have clean air, but so many are unnecessary and so many are job killing, we’re getting rid of the bad ones,” he said.

Despite his focus on coal miners, Trump also praised EPA employees. “You’re doing important work to protect our health and public resources, so important,” he said.

Trump also recognized Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (D-WV), who joined the event. After signing the executive order, Trump reached back with one of the signature pens and gave it to the miners.

“Only a miner, c’mon fellas you split it up,” he said, as the crowd laughed.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b168918d3:3101cc8:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) reportedly went on a tirade at a “swanky” Manhattan restaurant Sunday night, screaming at a wealthy patron over her support for President Trump.

Schumer lost his temper when dining at Upper East Side restaurant Sette Mezzo, the New York Post’s Page Six reported.

The top Senate Democrat was dining with friends when he ran into former U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr. and his wife, Hilary, at the restaurant.

Witnesses say that Schumer became incensed that Hilary, daughter of CBS founder and chairman William S. Paley, voted for Trump, though her husband is a prominent Democrat.

“They are a highly respected couple, and Schumer made a scene, yelling, ‘She voted for Trump!’ The Califanos left the restaurant, but Schumer followed them outside,” one witness said of the encounter.

“How could you vote for Trump? He’s a liar! He’s a liar!” Schumer reportedly yelled.

Hilary confirmed the encounter with Schumer and called the senator’s actions “really rude.”

“Sen. Schumer was really rude … He’s our senator, and I don’t really like him. Yes, I voted for Trump. Schumer joined us outside and he told me Trump was a liar. I should have told him that Hillary Clinton was a liar, but I was so surprised I didn’t say anything,” Hilary said.

Another witness told a different story about Schumer’s encounter with the couple, saying the senator approached the couple’s table first.

“It was a pleasant conversation. Joe said the senator was doing a good job on health care. Joe joked that Hilary voted for Trump. The conversation continued outside because everyone left at the same time,” the witness said.

In a statement, Schumer’s spokesperson denied that there was a heated encounter at the restaurant.

“[He] and his wife ate at the café on Sunday, engaging in unremarkable conversation with patrons who approached their table. There were no heated exchanges with ‎anyone,” the spokesperson said.

Schumer has railed against the Trump administration, saying Sunday that President Trump’s proposal for a border wall will not get votes from Republicans or Democrats.

He also called on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) to replace House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) and announced that Senate Democrats will filibuster Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b168918d3:3101cc7:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch is making actor Mark Ruffalo very, very angry. And you won’t like him when he’s angry.

The 49-year-old Hulk actor and liberal activist took to his Twitter account Tuesday to urge fans and followers to call their Democratic representatives to filibuster President Trump’s pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.

“Call, call, &amp; don’t stop calling,” Ruffalo wrote.

Daily Action: Urge Democratic Senators to stand united in favor of a Gorsuch filibuster. Call, call, &amp; don&apos;t stop calling (844) 241-1141 &amp; — Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) March 28, 2017

The actor also thanked Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for “holding strong” on his own vow to filibuster Gorsuch.

.@SenSchumer thanks for holding strong on #FilibusterGorsuch called again today and lines were busy. — Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) March 28, 2017

Will you be joining the filibuster? Will you be pressing your colleagues to do the same? https://t.co/4Zb3l8tLag — Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) March 28, 2017

On Monday, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee forced a one-week delay on Gorsuch’s confirmation vote. If Schumer attempts to filibuster Trump’s Supreme Court pick — as he indicated he would do last week — Gorsuch will need 60 votes for clearance to a simple majority vote, requiring eight Democrat votes in addition to 52 votes from Republicans.

Ruffalo has been a frequent critic of Trump’s administration.

In January, the actor and environmental activist joined fellow celebrities Alec Baldwin, Michael Moore and Robert De Niro at a pre-inauguration protest outside Trump Tower in Manhattan.

“Neo-liberalism is dead. Progressivism is alive, and we’re it,” Ruffalo said then. “We’re the people protectors. And this is heart work. That’s the only way. We need to protect our hearts. We need to lead from our hearts. We need to strengthen our hearts.”

Before the election, Ruffalo joined his Avengers castmates Robert Downey Jr. and Don Cheadle in a Joss Whedon-directed PSA that urged citizens to vote for former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over then-candidate Trump.

“Tell the world that you care about what happens to it,” he said in the video.

Politics is one of those sports where the team playing defense doesn’t get to score many points. Democrats are working hard to keep President Trump on defense, using an even more aggressive version of the same playbook they run against every Republican president. They think the collapse of Speaker Paul Ryan’s Obamacare repeal legislation last week gave them a new first down. Here are seven signs the Trump agenda has regained a great deal of momentum in just one day.

Jeff Sessions’ crackdown on sanctuary cities: On Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions strongly criticized “sanctuary cities” which refuse to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and said billions in federal funding could be jeopardized by continued refusal to comply with the law.

Sessions said sanctuary cities are “making our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the streets,” and cited overwhelming support from the American people for turning illegal alien criminals over to ICE. He noted that many of the aliens shielded by sanctuary cities are guilty of extremely serious offenses, including rape and murder.

This was unquestionably an aggressive move. The inevitable pushback from sanctuary apologists was panicked and defensive. They apparently thought the Trump administration had been intimidated out of pursuing such issues, especially after the president’s executive order for a temporary visa suspension was sabotaged by activist judges. The Democratic playbook says Republicans withdraw from the field after the first sign of injury, and never run a play twice if it doesn’t pick up significant political yardage on the first attempt.

Chicago and L.A. mayors defend sanctuary policies: The best sign that you’re on offense is when the opposing team scrambles into defensive formation. Sanctuary cities provide an excellent political opportunity for the Trump administration, since as Sessions noted, they have 80-percent-plus support from the American people on the issue.

Also, it’s great fun to watch Democrats, who used to believe states’ rights and the Tenth Amendment were dog-whistle phrases used by unpatriotic racists, argue that Democrat mayors should be allowed to ignore federal laws they don’t like, while still receiving billions of dollars from taxpayers in other parts of the country.

Thus we have Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, who presides over one of the bloodiest urban hellscapes in the nation, claiming that he has some kind of constitutional right to federal taxpayer dollars, even as he defies American voters by protecting illegal alien criminals from deportation. Republicans will benefit enormously from Rahm Emanuel becoming the face of Democrat city governance.

Emanuel’s office attempted to link the sanctuary city crackdown to Trump’s executive order on immigration, as did Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti. “My office will continue to ensure local governments have the tools they need to legally protect their immigrant communities – and we won’t stop fighting to beat back President Trump’s un-American immigration policies,” Garcetti declared. This reinforces the point made above about Democrats expecting the Trump administration to retreat from immigration after the legal challenges to his executive order.

To be sure, immigration is a complicated issue. There are parts of the debate where public opinion becomes much more divided. At the moment, Trump is fighting on precisely the ground that made so many Americans disgusted with a corrupt establishment and its refusal to execute simple duties to the citizens of the United States. He’s playing from strength, and should ignore the Left’s attempts to convince him otherwise.

One reason the Left fights so hard on this absurd ground is that it fears conceding any point about the corrupt folly of our poorly-enforced immigration laws, or that illegal immigrants are indeed breaking the law. In other words, they’re playing red-zone defense, because they know there are big points to be scored against them.

Environmental executive orders: Reining in madcap environmentalism and bureaucratic bloat is another issue where the Trump administration enjoys tremendous popular support. The president’s forthcoming executive order to roll back Obama-era climate change orders and promote energy independence will likely be another play made from a position of great strength. (It is important to note that at the time of this writing, the exact contents of Trump’s order were not know.)

The Trump administration seems interested in pointing out how shoddy, self-serving, and doctored the data behind these climate change initiatives has been. For example, it’s a killer point that the EPA knew its own expensive regulations would have no measurable effect on global temperatures. That kind of anecdote has a long shelf life. The administration can run a play like that over and over again, picking up a few yards every time.

“Draining the swamp” involves hammering home the truth that Washington itself is a special interest, endlessly lobbying itself for more money and power. The EPA is among the worst examples of “regulatory capture,” where the line between a federal agency and its lobbyists becomes blurred. Taxpayers will rally behind Trump every time he hits the flabbiest, most economy-stifling sections of the federal bureaucracy.

Investigating Clinton ties to Russia: Of course, Trump’s critics will accuse him of trying to change the subject by asking congressional investigators to look into connections between the Clinton machine and Russia. Whatever the ultimate outcome may be, it is unquestionably an example of the Trump team running an offensive play when it’s supposed to be permanently on defense.

In years past, critics who called Republicans the “Stupid Party” often complained about how easily they were put on defense, swiftly accepting media narratives that required them to spend their days responding to allegations without pushing back. For better or worse, going back to the earliest moments of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump has refused to assume a permanent defensive crouch, on nearly any issue. Many of the confident pundit predictions that his campaign was doomed, at various critical junctures, were born from the conventional wisdom that Trump would pay a heavy price for refusing to become defensive and apologetic. The conventional wisdom proved to be incorrect.

This particular play is still in progress, so it’s hard to say where the ball will end up. It doesn’t hurt to spotlight how Democrat opinion of Russia turned on a dime after the 2016 election. Also, the curious notion that Hillary Clinton is absolved of all offenses under some mythical “old news” clause of political law because she lost the election should be shredded, especially since we would currently be hearing loud demands to absolve her of all offenses if she had won the election.

Ford factory expansion in America: Bill Clinton’s famous campaign slogan, “It’s the Economy, Stupid,” comes to mind when news like Ford Motor Company’s announcement of three new plants in Michigan breaks. The next two elections will be very heavily influenced by how well the economy is doing. Good economic news will give Trump and congressional Republicans political capital to spend on other issues. Naturally they will become more energetic about pursuing their agenda with a strong financial wind at their backs.

It will be very difficult for Democrats to downplay good news from the automotive industry, given how much they made of President Obama “saving the industry.” A constant drumbeat of job creation stories from various industries has driven consumer confidence to a 16-year-high, according to a new report.

Much of Trump’s agenda – including immigration, regulatory reform, and tax reform – is linked to his often-stated vision of a stronger American economy producing more jobs. Every part of that agenda becomes more difficult for Democrats to oppose if the economy is, in fact, stronger and producing more jobs.

One-page Obamacare repeal: The Trump Agenda may even be playing stronger offense than the Trump White House at the moment. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) has filed a one-line bill that would repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.

Brooks said one of the purposes behind his bill is to “burn away the fog” and “show American voters who really wants to repeal Obamacare, and who merely acted that way during election time.” We’ll have to see how many of his colleagues run downfield to catch that particular pass.

The simplicity of Brooks’ bill was a slap in the face to Speaker Paul Ryan’s convoluted, ineffective, wildly unpopular, and politically tone deaf Ryancare bill that would have hurt Trump’s base more than anyone.

It was quite noticeable that at no point during the brief tussle over the House bill were Democrats put on defense over the failures of Obamacare. Instead, Republicans were left stammering dubious excuses for why they didn’t bring back the last repeal bill they passed while President Obama was still in the White House, producing the cloud of fog Brooks wants to burn away with his simple bill.

Chuck Schumer’s public meltdown: If Obamacare repeal was a debacle that left much of the GOP looking defensive, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s embarrassing tirade against a Trump supporter at a Manhattan restaurant on Sunday is a sign that Democrats’ grip on the ball is none too tight. Schumer certainly didn’t act like he was brimming with confidence after an ostensibly catastrophic week for congressional Republicans and the White House.

Democrats are banking heavily on their “Resistance” mythology of a stolen election and illegitimate Trump presidency. (They did the same thing after Bush won in 2000, but now we have social media and an even more voracious news cycle to amplify their histrionics.) The problem with such a strategy is that it runs the risk of alienating people who aren’t super-partisans. Those people are also growing annoyed by the hyper-politicization of everything in American life. Political eruptions in a restaurant are the sort of thing that makes them groan.

Hyper-partisanship is a long pass down the field that runs a high risk of interception. It’s too easy for the other team to pick off that pass by getting things done and generating positive press. Average voters don’t follow the minutiae of Washington scandal wars the way pundits do. It’s an article of conventional political wisdom that Republicans went too far criticizing presidents Clinton and Obama at various junctures, alienating some persuadable middle voters. The same thing can happen with Trump, no matter how hard Democrats try to paint him as a uniquely divisive and objectionable president. Presidents have a great deal of power to go back on offense after setbacks, as we’re seeing right now.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b166d8c0e:30d11c1:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Consumer’s confidence in March rocketed to the highest level more than 16 years, according to data released Tuesday. America’s middle class, in particular, registered huge gains in confidence.

The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index soared to 125.6 in March, up from 116.1 in February. Economists had expected a decline to 114.1.

Measures of consumer and business confidence continue to defy experts by climbing ever higher since the election of President Donald Trump. Despite media reports of hate crimes and an ongoing narrative that America has unentered a period of uncertainty and ill-will, surveys of consumers show that Americans are feeling better than they have for nearly all of this century.

The rise in confidence since the election has widespread, cutting across regional and income groups. The biggest rise in confidence came from middle earners. The confidence index for households with incomes between $50,000 and $75,000 has risen from 100.4 prior to the election to 135.2. Households with incomes between $35,000 and $50,000 registered a rise from 79.9 to 113.4. Only those with incomes below $15,000 are less confident now than before the election.

Consumers are more confident about both their present situations and their expectations for the future, according to the Conference Board. Confidence in the jobs market has improved as well, with those saying jobs are “plentiful” rising while those claiming jobs are “hard to get” falling.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b166d8c0e:30d11bf:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday that the city will be at risk of terror attacks if Attorney General Jeff Sessions cuts federal law enforcement funding to sanctuary cities, the Daily Caller reported.

“President Trump’s latest threat changes nothing. We will remain a city welcoming of immigrants, who have helped make our city the safest big city in the nation,” de Blasio said. “Any attempt to cut NYPD funding for the nation’s top terror target will be aggressively fought in court. We won’t back down from protecting New Yorkers from terror – or from an overzealous administration fixated on xenophobia and needless division.”

De Blasio made his statement in response to Sessions’ latest crackdown on sanctuary cities, in which the attorney general said Monday that the Department of Justice would prevent billions of dollars in law enforcement grants from going to sanctuary jurisdictions.

Sessions argued that the policies of sanctuary cities make America less safe.

“Countless Americans would be alive today … if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended,” Sessions said, who added that he used a tactic that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch employed.

The attorney general also pointed to a report from the Department of Homeland Security that highlighted more than 200 cases of law enforcement agencies that refused to turn over criminal aliens to federal immigration officers.

De Blasio also criticized President Trump’s plan to cut funding for sanctuary cities in January but said that his threat would amount to nothing more than a “charade.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b166d8c0e:30d11be:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Pete Sepp, president of the National Taxpayers Union, talked with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday about tax reform and infrastructure, two pending President Trump initiatives.

Regarding tax reform, Sepp said, “One big issue that I don’t think Washington really wants to pay attention to is the fact that Gallup’s annual survey of tax fairness and tax burdens conducted since the 1950s has shown that there’s a fifteen-year-high of dissatisfaction with both the amount of tax the government is taking and the way it’s doing it.”

“The time really is right for tax reform,” he continued, “and President Trump and leaders in Congress would be wise to appeal directly to the American people on their sense of fairness and the fact that Washington is already taking too much from them.”

The top Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee called on the Treasury Department Tuesday to end the policy of designating non-bank financial companies as Too Big To Fail.

In a letter sent Tuesday, Senator Tom Cotton and nine other Republican Senators urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to “use the all tools available” to reverse the Obama administration’s policy of having a federal council designate non-bank financial companies as “systemically important financial institutions,” a designation that brings with it stringent supervision by the Federal Reserve, new capital requirements, and costly regulatory burdens.

Critics of the policy claim that designating nonbank companies as SIFI’s is counterproductive because it creates the impression that were the companies to fail despite regulation, the government would act to bail them out. Instead of dismantling Too Big To Fail, SIFI designation actually reinforces it, critics charge.

“Among its many flaws, Dodd-Frank enshrined ‘Too Big To Fail’ as an official policy by creating a Federal council to designate nonbanks as ‘systemically important financial institutions.’ These designations offer large firms implicit taxpayer backing for future bailouts and result in massive new regulatory costs,” the group of Senators said in a statement Tuesday.

The Senators frame their letter as supporting the President Donald Trump’s Executive Order on financial regulation. It was signed by Senators Cotton, Pat Toomey, Richard Chelby, Mike Crapo, Mike Rounds, John Kennedy, Ben Sasse, David Perdue, Thom Tillis and Tim Scott.

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new financial regulatory body called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, an intergovernmental taskforce led by the Treasury Secretary, and gave it the power to designate financial companies as SIFIs. The council, known as FSOC, designated three large insurance companies–American International Group, Prudential Insurance, and MetLife–as SIFIs. Last year, a federal judge ruled that the designation of MetLife was “arbitrary and capricious,” describing FSOC’s process as “fatally flawed.”

The Obama administration appealed that ruling and the case was heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last fall. Many expected the Trump administration would drop the appeal, letting the original ruling overturning the SIFI designation stand. The failure of the Trump administration to act has perplexed allies of the administration on Capitol Hill and in the insurance industry.

Although the letter from Senator Cotton and others doesn’t explicitly mention the MetLife case, it is undoubtedly an attempt to spur the administration to action on the matter.

“The FSOC’s process for designating non-bank systemically important financial institutions lacks transparency and accountability,” the letter states, echoing the language of the federal court’s decision overturning the MetLife designation.

“There have been high-level talks about this, yet nothing has happened. Hopefully this gets the administration off its keister,” said one person familiar with the background of the letter.

One concern is that if the administration does not act swiftly, the D.C. Circuit Court could issue a decision reversing the lower court. That would complicate efforts to reverse the designation of the insurance companies as SIFIS.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b15acb32a:34cae4e:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday evening and asked why aren’t congressional lawmakers probing the various deals, transactions, and connections former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have to Russia.

“Why isn’t the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill &amp; Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech,” read Trump’s first tweet, which was followed by, “…money to Bill, the Hillary Russian “reset,” praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!”

Why isn&apos;t the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill &amp; Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017

…money to Bill, the Hillary Russian &quot;reset,&quot; praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017

Trump’s assertion that then-Secretary of State Clinton “allowed big Uranium to go to Russia” and Bill Clinton’s high-dollar “Russian speech” were allegations first reported by The New York Times (NYT) and based on research from the NYT bestseller Clinton Cash, authored by Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer.

The facts found in Clinton Cash, reported by the NYT, and deemed accurate by establishment media reveal how Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State coincided with the influx of tens of millions of dollars from foreign sources into the Clinton Foundation which resulted in favorable actions for Russia’s government.

Indeed the Clinton Foundation had received millions in donations from several investors in Uranium One, a Canadian-based company in which a majority stake was sold to Russia’s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, in a lucrative deal needing approval from Clinton’s State Department and eight other federal agencies.

“The sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States,” The New York Times confirmed.

The “deal,” as Trump points out, refers to how donations to the Clinton Foundation from executives of Russian-owned Uranium One had exceeded $145 million, according to the New York Times. In fact, those Clinton Foundation donations from uranium investors spiked just as the deal for Russia’s Rosatom to secure Uranium One was being finalized.

A troublesome series of undisclosed donations came from former Uranium One chairman Ian Telfer.

Telfer made four foreign donations totaling $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation while the uranium deal was being negotiated. However, the Times noted, “those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.”

“We made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them,” The Clinton Foundation admitted at the time. But Hillary Clinton’s failure to disclose the millions in donations her family foundation received from Teller was a direct violation of the Memorandum of Understanding she signed with the Obama administration promising to disclose all foreign donations during her tenure as Secretary of State.

More troubling still, was the $500,000 speech Bill Clinton delivered in Moscow that was paid for by “a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin” at the time of the Uranium One deal, the New Yorker confirmed.

“Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State?” asks the liberal publication.

Trump’s calls for a federal investigation into the Clintons’ Russia ties come amid a partisan push to link the President and his aides to Russian influence-peddling and collusion during the presidential campaign.

President Donald Trump’s immediate 2017 budget request will fund the first 62 miles of border walls and fences, pending the appropriation of more funds in late 2017 for additional construction in 2018, says a report from CNN.

According to CNN, ” The [2017] money will fund 14 miles of new border wall in San Diego, 28 miles of new levee wall barriers and six miles of new border wall in the Rio Grande Valley region and 14 miles of replacement fencing in San Diego.”

CNN’s report does not say how much of the $1 billion planned for extra spending in early 2017 would be allocated to planning and long-term construction of the border fence, which is expected to stretch along much of the nation’s 2,000-mile border. The fence or wall is expected to annually save tens of billions of dollars in reduced spending on illegals and also on offsetting the wage-cutting impact of illegal immigrants.

Already, according to CNN, the administration’s budget “documents also claim that Trump’s executive orders on immigration enforcement are already having an effect, saying arrests are up 50%, charges are up 40% and requests to detain arrested individuals who are deportable are up 80%.”

Trump’s new budget plans also call for an extra $2.6 billion in spending for 2018 to improve border security and construction.

Top Democratic leaders, including the Democrats’ Senate leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer, are hoping to block construction of the wall. But numerous polls show that strong majorities of Americans want to reduce the flow of drugs, preserve U.S. jobs for Americans and also want Congress to pass laws that help Americans. In 2006, Congress passed a law authorizing — but not funding — the construction of a border wall.

Trump’s budget document was sent to Congress March 16, and is titled “America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again.” It is not the formal budget request for 2018, but it outlines spending plans for 2018, and it requests amendments to the 2017 budgets set by Congress late last year.

If the requested budget amendments are approved by Congress, the DHS 2017 budget in 2017 would rise by $3 billion. The budget plan also calls for the DHS 2018 budget to be set at $44 billion. A comprehensive budget request for FY 2018 will be delivered to Congress in May.

According to a department statement:

The FY 2017 Budget Amendment would provide $3 billion [in 2017] for DHS implementation of recent Executive Orders. The request would fund efforts to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, and make other critical investments in tactical border infrastructure and technology. The request also proposes funding to increase immigration detention capacity, which is necessary to ensure the removal of illegal aliens from the United States. Finally, the request funds additional capacity at DHS to prepare for hiring additional immigration law enforcement officers and agents… • Funds hiring of 500 new Border Patrol Agents and 1,000 new ICE law enforcement personnel, plus associated support staff. • Provides a further investment of $2.6 billion for high priority tactical infrastructure and border security technology, including funding to continue planning, designing, and constructing a border wall. • Provides $1.5 billion above the 2017 Annualized CR level to expand detention, transportation, and removal of illegal immigrants. • Invests $15 million to begin implementation of mandatory nationwide use of the E-Verify Program. • Includes $1.5 billion for DHS activities that protect federal networks and critical infrastructure from an attack. • Sustains current funding levels for the U.S. Coast Guard, which allows for the continuation of day-to-day operations and investments in the Acquisition, Construction, &amp; Improvements account. • Restructures user fees for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to ensure that the cost of government services is not subsidized by taxpayers who do not directly benefit from those programs. • Reduces Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administered grants, saving $667 million; additionally the budget proposes establishing a 25% non-federal cost match for FEMA preparedness grants that do not currently require a non-federal match.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti promised Monday to defend his “sanctuary city” policy against President Donald Trump, after the administration’s announcement that sanctuary cities would begin to lose federal funding for defying federal law.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced earlier in the day that the Trump administration would not send any of the $4 billion in law enforcement grants provided through the Department of Justice to cities that ignored or blocked federal efforts to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.

“I urge the nation’s states and cities to carefully consider the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws,” Sessions had said.

In response, Garcetti was defiant, according to the Los Angeles Daily News: “Slashing funds for first-responders, for our port and airport, for counterterrorism, crime-fighting and community-building serves no one — not this city, not the federal government, not the American people,” he said on Monday.

Other city leaders in California were similarly defiant, the Los Angeles Times reports:

“We will fight this vigorously and still continue to maintain services to provide for our high quality of life in Santa Ana,” Sal Tinajero, a city councilman in Santa Ana, which voted unanimously to become a sanctuary city shortly after Donald Trump was elected president. … In a statement, a spokesperson for [San Francisco Mayor Ed] Lee said: “San Francisco’s sanctuary city laws are in compliance with this federal law. If the federal government believes there is a need to detain a serious criminal they can obtain a criminal warrant, which we will honor, as we always have… As we have always asserted, sanctuary cities are safer cities. When immigrants can enroll their children in school, access healthcare for vaccinations, and report crimes, our City and County is safer.” The statement added: “It is shocking that the U.S. Attorney General, the nation’s top law enforcement official, does not agree with this basic principle of public safety.”

State officials have already moved to oppose Trump’s executive order earlier this year targeting sanctuary cities, with new Attorney General Xavier Becerra filing a brief last week on behalf of Santa Clara County’s lawsuit against the federal government.

A new poll by the Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) at UC Berkeley shows that a majority of registered voters in California want the state’s elected Democrats to work with President Donald Trump rather than to resist his agenda.

The poll reveals that “by a 53% to 47% margin, slightly more voters prefer that when state leaders disagree with the president they should try to work with him even if it means making compromises, rather than opposing him if it risks negative consequences and losses in federal funding.”

Voters prefer that Democrats work with Trump even though 61% disapprove of the job he is doing, according to the poll, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3.6%.

In fact, the poll found that Trump has lower approval ratings than any U.S. president at this point in his presidency since the poll began, with President John F. Kennedy in 1961.

In addition, the poll finds that Californians reject “CalExit” and proposals to secede from the Union by more than a two-to-one margin, 68% to 32%. Republicans (85% no, 15% yes) are more opposed than Democrats (56% no, 44% yes) to seceding.

The poll also found that California voters approve of Trump’s policies on infrastructure, the economy and jobs — and disapprove of his policies on every other issue. Trump rated lowest on his policies on the environment, and on minority groups.

Illegal immigration was a closer call, with 38% of California’s registered voters approving of his policies and 49% disapproving, as the state’s Democrats prepare for a showdown with Trump over the contentious issue of sanctuary cities.

On Monday, Katie Glueck, senior political correspondent for the McClatchy news agency, published an extensive profile of Breitbart Jerusalem and how bureau chief Aaron Klein leads a team that reports from the Middle East while Breitbart grows in influence during the era of President Donald Trump.

Gleuck reported:

On a Wednesday afternoon in March, Klein was found running Breitbart Jerusalem operations from his luxurious three-story apartment located, notably, not in Jerusalem but in Tel Aviv, the most liberal, cosmopolitan city in Israel. As storm clouds gathered over the Mediterranean, which was visible from his airy kitchen, Klein sipped a Diet Coke and alternated between expounding on the opportunities for Breitbart Jerusalem in the Trump era and tending to his dog, a black and white papillon named Uzi—for the gun.

“We have major influence right now politically,” said Klein, who also makes the 45-mile trek to Jerusalem multiple times a week to report. “Our platform skyrocketed since the election. It increased in the last year, I would say. Around the time of the campaign,” he said. “With the rise of Trump and the rise of Breitbart.”

…Klein said the Breitbart Jerusalem platform is growing in influence along with the rest of the organization in the Trump era, and the outlet has recently landed interviews with prominent American and Middle Eastern officials.

Malibu residents declared their coveted beachfront community a “sanctuary city” during a Malibu City Hall meeting last week.

“While some residents praised the proposal, others blamed those who are in the country illegally for crime, and called the move a thinly disguised rebuke of President Trump,” wrote the Los Angeles Times, which was present at the event.

According to the Times, actor-turned-activist Martin Sheen suggested the idea of making Malibu a sanctuary city back in December.

The median household income in Malibu is over $120,000 annually.

Councilwoman Laura Rosenthal was reportedly inspired by Sheen’s speech in December. “I think some people in Malibu have people working for them who are undocumented,” Rosenthal reportedly said during last week’s meeting.

A 2010 census shows that Hispanics make up just 6 percent of Malibu’s population, while 91 percent of the oceanside community is white. However, a sizable proportion of the beach city’s service workforce is Latino.

Last December, California State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) introduced State Senate Bill 54, which seeks to declare all of California a “sanctuary state.” Last week, over 100 people gathered in front of the Hall of Justice in Downtown Los Angeles to protest L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell’s opposition to the bill.

According to the Los Angeles Daily News, protesters held up signs that read, “One struggle, united” and “We demand immigrant rights.”

Last month, 161 illegal aliens were arrested throughout Southern California by federal immigration authorities. The raids took place over the course of several days and resulted in the arrests of 680 illegal aliens across multiple states. That, in turn, upset many of the state’s Democratic lawmakers.

In January, Oakland — one of California’s many sanctuary cities — set up a $300,000 anti-deportation fund in response to President Trump’s executive order that aims to cut off federal funds to “jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply” with federal immigration enforcement.

The New York Times published a report from Internet security firm Symantec that revealed startling ambitions on the part of hackers affiliated with North Korea.

According to the report, they have plans to rob over a hundred banks around the world, including “institutions like the World Bank, the European Central Bank and big American companies including Bank of America.”

An attack on over 20 Polish banks near the end of 2016 was evidently thwarted without any money being lost. When security analysts pulled apart the virus software sent to these banks, they discovered a huge list of Internet addresses for other financial institutions, making up the target list described by Symantec.

The Times discusses the size and desperation of North Korea’s cybercrime ring:

The list of targets, which has not been previously reported, is part of a growing body of evidence showing how North Korea, a country that is cut off from much of the global economy, is increasingly trying to use its cyberattack abilities to bring in cash — and making progressively bolder attempts to do so. North Korea’s hacking network is immense, encompassing a group of 1,700 hackers aided by more than 5,000 trainers, supervisors and others in supporting roles, South Korean officials estimate. Because of the country’s poor infrastructure, the hackers typically work abroad, in places like China, Southeast Asia and Europe. Like other North Koreans allowed to work abroad, the hackers are constantly monitored by minders for possible breaches in allegiance to the government.

Thus far, the biggest score for the North Korean operation appears to be a hack of Bangladesh’s central bank, revealed by Bangladeshi authorities in May 2016. The $81 million stolen from the bank ended up in the Philippines, but investigators were certain from early in the investigation that the thieves were not from either Bangladesh or the Philippines.

Early indications suggested Chinese hackers might have been responsible for the attack, but Symantec researchers soon isolated malicious code linked to North Korea. Similar code and hacking techniques had previously been used against banks in Vietnam and Ecuador. According to the New York Times, analysts with the National Security Agency saw evidence the Bangladesh bank robbery was linked to the attack on Sony Pictures, which is generally seen as the work of North Korea.

The thieves were actually trying to steal a billion dollars from Bangladesh with fraudulent money transfer requests to the New York Federal Reserve, but only $81 million in bogus requests got through.

The attack on Poland’s banks was carried out with a “watering hole” hacking technique, which involves planting malware in locations the targets are likely to visit. Disturbingly, the watering hole for the Polish caper was the website of Poland’s banking regulator. Symantec mentioned similar watering hole traps have been laid for banks in Mexico and Uruguay, while virus attacks have been made already against a few targets in the United States.

An important point made by security analysts about these bank robberies is that huge amounts of manpower were involved, making state sponsorship of the attacks likely. The malware used in these assaults can lurk in targeted systems for weeks, going active during very limited windows of opportunity, so a large team of computer technicians has to work around the clock to supervise the intrusion.

Only one Chinese bank appeared in the target list distilled from captured viral code in Poland, a detail some analysts find significant. There are lingering suspicions that Chinese hackers assisted in pulling off the Bangladesh attack. This could become a major topic of conversation when Chinese president Xi Jinping meets with President Trump next month.

Security firm FireEye, which was instrumental in past actions against Chinese hackers, has reported a significant decline in Chinese industrial cyber-espionage over the past two years, coupled with an increase in Russian mischief. CEO Kevin Mandia warned Fortune last week that American companies are still “getting sucker punched pretty bad.”

North Korea has denied involvement in the wave of cyber attacks on financial institutions, claiming the United States reached “despicable heights” with its accusations. Pyongyang called America a “hacking empire, the worst of bullying countries” and said the hacking allegations were a pretext to “launch a pre-emptive strike” against North Korea.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b1559ea48:33e3067:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The newly appointed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt will welcome President Donald Trump to the massive EPA government building on Tuesday. The president will then sign an executive order that will start rolling back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan.

Trump’s executive order will be another major step for Pruitt’s effort to restore the EPA to its limited authorities.

“We’re going to roll it back, those things that were unlawful, we’re going to roll back those things that were an overreach, we’re going to roll back the steps taken by the previous administration,” Pruitt said in an interview with Breitbart News inside his office at the EPA federal building in Washington D.C. The enormous federal building is right across the street from the Old Post Office building, recently renovated into the Trump International Hotel.

Trump’s entry in the building will likely trigger renewed sadness for some agency bureaucrats who were reportedly in tears after Trump won the election.

In February, sources speaking to Inside EPA suggested that demoralized employees would be unlikely to attend an event with Trump and Pruitt, as they were deeply dissatisfied over the administration’s proposed changes the agency. Trump’s budget outline, released earlier this month, threatened to slash the department’s funding by 31 percent. The executive order will not only order a review of the Clean Power Plan but also change Obama-era executive orders on climate change and carbon emissions regulations, a dramatic change from Obama’s legacy that prioritized a regulatory agenda.

But Pruitt feels energized by the president’s visit, kicking off a set of new priorities for the agency that he believes lost its way in the Obama years. As Trump’s EPA administrator, Prutt will also sign a series of rules and procedures during the president’s visit to reform the agency.

Rescinding the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt explained was “a snapshot of the future” of how the Trump administration would approach regulatory reform.

Under the Obama administration, Pruitt said that the oil, coal, and natural gas industries were under federal “regulatory assault,” which killed energy jobs around the country.

“I think the greatest impediment we’ve had on economic growth is regulatory uncertainty,” he said. Trump, he explained, understood that the regulatory process had become so tangled that it was difficult for companies to invest and grow.

Pruitt’s philosophy is an example of the Trump administration’s goal to dismantle the federal government’s overbearing bureaucracy, for the sake of boosting economic growth.

“We have situations here, and this is not just unique to the EPA, it’s other agencies at the federal level as well that do permitting, where it takes eight or nine years to get a permit to do something,” he said. “Well that’s not a decision, that’s obstructionism.”

Pruitt explained that he wanted to restore confidence among businesses and workers in the energy industry, particularly in coal, natural gas, and oil.

“Agencies at the federal level are part of the executive branch, they exist to enforce the law, not make the law,” he said.

Pruitt describes his philosophy as “EPA originalism.” Part of his goal, he said, was to re-focus the agency toward Congress’s original authorities. That’s sending a different message to the industries regulated by the EPA.

“I can just tell you there’s buoyancy, buoyancy across the country that there’s a different attitude, a different belief, a different view,” Pruitt said. “We can be both pro-growth and pro-environment, we’ve done it as a country throughout our existence.”

Some of the rules passed by the Obama administration, Pruitt said, actually hurt the agency as they that were “untethered” to the legal statutes, often at the behest of well funded environmental groups that donated to Democrats. Some of those efforts were halted in court, creating more uncertainty about the agency’s authority.

“When you look at the outcome of that kind of agenda, it was detrimental,” he said.

As the Attorney General of Oklahoma, Pruitt led the legal charge against the EPA, arguing that the agency was overstepping it’s authorities. He sued the agency 13 different times, putting many of the Obama-era rules in legal deadlock.

Pruitt also has a reputation of challenging environmentalist priorities like climate change, but his critics told Breitbart News columnist James Delingpole that repealing the EPA’s Endangerment Finding on CO2 emissions were not included in the Trump’s executive order. Pruitt confirmed to Breitbart News that the executive order would not repeal the EPA’s Endangerment finding, but he appeared open to addressing it in the future.

“I think that if there are petitions for reconsideration for the endangering findings, we’ll have to address those at some point,” he said. “I don’t know if they’ve actually been filed in that regard, but our objective, and our role is to do what the law requires.”

Pruitt believes that the agency should return its focus to tackling big environmental cleanup projects.

Part of restoring the EPA’s original mission, he explained, was refocusing the agency on the 1300 hazardous “superfund sites” designated by the agency as priority areas for cleanup.

“Many of those sites … on this national priority list have been on that list for 30-40 years, that doesn’t sound like a priority list to me,” he said. He cited the Port of Portland in the state of Oregon and the mining cleanup in Butte, Montana as two examples of designated “superfund” agencies that need renewed attention.

“We need to get busy with some new ways to address those,” Pruitt said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b14eb9768:331d441:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

(AP) — Israeli leaders hoping President Donald Trump would be a rubber stamp for the Jewish state are hearing plenty of reassuring rhetoric at this week’s annual gathering for the “unbreakable” alliance.

Missing from the agenda: Concrete steps advancing the Israeli government’s top priorities.

The Iran nuclear deal, so despised by Israel, is solidly in place. The U.S. Embassy is no closer to moving to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government wants. As it has under past presidents, Washington is still telling Israel to slow settlement construction.

It is making for an unusual American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, one relieved of the strains that marked the last years of President Barack Obama’s tenure but also filled with significant uncertainty.

Netanyahu on Monday called the U.S.-Israeli relationship “stronger than ever.”

His ambassador to the U.S., Ron Dermer, said a day earlier that for the first time in years or even decades, “there is no daylight between our two governments.”

Vice President Mike Pence said he and Trump “stand without apology for Israel and we always will.”

But it’s too early to tell whether Trump will ultimately fulfill Israel’s wishes. And there are indications he’s reconsidering several stances adopted during the campaign.

As a candidate, Trump repeatedly vowed to be the president to finally relocate the embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel considers its capital. As Pence said Sunday, that unequivocal promise has morphed into Trump now “giving serious consideration to moving the American Embassy.”

Though Trump in the campaign said he’d renegotiate or dismantle the Iran nuclear deal, which Israel fiercely opposes, as president he’s continuing to implement the accord while examining whether it should stand and hitting Iran with other, non-nuclear sanctions. GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, rather than urging that the deal be terminated, told AIPAC that the U.S. must “vigorously enforce” the deal and “tighten the screws on Iranian compliance.”

Netanyahu has taken some reassurance from the fact that Trump’s budget proposal safeguards every penny of Israel’s $3.1 billion in U.S. assistance, even as it seeks to slash foreign aid overall. And while the Obama administration stung Israel by allowing a U.N. resolution critical of Israel to pass in Obama’s final weeks, new U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has pledged not to let that happen again.

“We said, ‘The days of Israel-bashing are over,&apos;” Haley told AIPAC on Monday.

The biggest question mark may be Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.

On that matter, Obama and Netanyahu struggled to speak with a unified voice. Trump has shown significant flexibility — stunning many last month when he broke with decades of U.S. policy by saying the U.S. could live with a one-state solution, rather than a two-state solution involving Palestinian statehood, if both Israelis and Palestinians agreed.

Now Trump and the Israeli leader are both speaking vaguely of a broader Middle East package. Israel’s Arab neighbors, who traditionally opposed Israel but have realigned because of common concerns about Iran — would serve as guarantors.

“The common dangers faced by Israel and many of our Arab neighbors now offer a rare opportunity to build bridges towards a better future,” Netanyahu said.

Trump’s diplomacy in the region appears to be gaining speed. As Netanyahu spoke to the AIPAC conference by video from Jerusalem, White House envoy Jason Greenblatt was headed to Jordan to attend an Arab summit, according to a U.S. official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the trip publicly and requested anonymity.

Greenblatt, Trump’s longtime business attorney, will be an observer at the summit, but plans to use his visit to discuss the type of regional approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Netanyahu and Trump have floated. While in Amman, Greenblatt plans to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan and Algeria, the U.S. official said.

Another issue central to the conflict — settlements — remains a work in progress for Israel and Trump. The president’s softer campaign tone about Israel’s construction of Jewish homes in east Jerusalem and the West Bank has been replaced by Trump’s suggesting in his first White House meeting with Netanyahu to “hold back on settlements for a bit.”

At that meeting, Trump and Netanyahu voiced confidence they could work out an understanding, while providing few hints how.

A visit by Israeli officials last week ended with a public statement saying Israel would take Trump’s concerns “into consideration” and pledges by both countries to keep talking.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b14eb9768:331d43e:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald Trump will roll out a new executive order on Tuesday that eliminates several Obama-era climate change orders in favor of policies centered on energy independence.

A senior administration official said that the coming EO will review some and take other Obama executive orders “off the books immediately to the extent we can,” while also looking forward to providing a “beginning framework for a strategy on energy.” Under the new order, each executive department and agency in the U.S. government will be responsible for identifying impediments to energy production.

Energy policy under the order will stay in line with the President’s desire for U.S. energy independence and return the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to its core mission. The new order establishes the Trump Administration’s approach to climate change.

Former President Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which has been tied up in the courts, will be reviewed and possibly find itself on the chopping block in Trump’s new order. There is not a time frame for review of the Clean Power Plan, but the official predicted that there would be court challenges regarding that aspect of the EO. The new rule from the Clean Air Act will also be reviewed.

The Interior Department-imposed coal moratorium will also be rescinded, according to the official.

The official listed Obama Administration Presidential memorandums, including the 2013 Climate Action Plan, among what will be rescinded, “…that obviously will be going away.” A total of about six executive orders and memorandums will be rescinded.

The official stated that there would be policies related to the National Environmental Policy Act. Guidance on climate change published by the Council on Environmental Quality last August will be rescinded. The senior administration official added that there would be language on the “social cost of greenhouse gases.” Carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide were specifically mentioned.

“The previous Administration put out its own estimates, not in a very transparent fashion, in a fashion that we believe violates the longstanding OMB policies.” Those will no longer stand as a result, the official added. Regulations related to methane production at EPA and the Bureau of Land Management will be reviewed to see if they “reflect the policy priority that’s outlined at the beginning of the order.”

The Administration is looking at all energy options including nuclear, renewables, clean coal, natural gas, “all of it,” the official said.

Questions regarding the Administration’s stance on the Paris climate agreement were denied as the Administration continues to discuss it.

The coal industry can expect to see review of coal policies and potential rescinding of some Obama Administration policies. The official said that President Trump, “is gonna do whatever he can to help those workers.” The official continued, “There are a lot of different portions that conspire to affect” the coal industry.

“The Clean Power Plan was designed to address Climate Change. You look at EPA’s own numbers, they even admitted that in terms of how it’s going to impact global temperatures, it’s not,” said the official. “I think there are plenty of rules on the books already. We will continue to enforce that provide for clean air and clean water.” The official said that’s the core mission of EPA that the President wants them to stick to.

A strong growing economy is among the best ways to protect the environment, the official said.

“The previous administration devalued workers by their policies,” the official continued. “We’re saying we can do both, we can protect the environment and provide people with work and keep the economy growing.”

The official stated that the President is “not going to pursue climate or environmental policies that put the U.S. economy at risk. It’s very simple.”

A group of criminal aliens showed up to a Tarrant County, Texas, work release program and were surprised they were getting arrested instead of getting a job. When they arrived at the county facility, immigration officers took the allegedly undocumented criminal immigrants into custody.

Two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vans arrived at the Tarrant County probation office Sunday morning; witnesses told KGNS NBC8. The immigration officers took custody of a group of illegal aliens who came to the facility to participate in a work release program run by the county.

Dallas area media outlets downplayed the criminal status of what they called “unauthorized immigrants” and played on their coming to perform “community service.”

Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn told KXAS NBC5 his office participated in the operation following a request from immigration officials. The sheriff previously vowed to help President Donald Trump keep his word on deporting criminal aliens, Breitbart Texas reported in February. He announced his office applied for the ICE 287(g) program to help deputies identify criminal aliens in the jail. The program will certify 12 deputies to work in the jail as immigration officers.

“This was totally initiated by ICE,” the sheriff told the NBC affiliate. “They came to us and said, ‘Listen, we reviewed the list [of names], and we suspect some of them are illegal aliens.’ So we said, ‘Whatever you need to do.&apos;”

The Dallas Morning News reported ICE officers picked up 26 “unauthorized immigrants” when they arrived to perform “community service.”

The Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office told KXAS the criminal aliens had convictions for felonies and misdemeanors. Those include offenses of drunk driving, theft, and assault, Sheriff Waybourn explained to the reporter.

A KXAS cameraman recorded some of the activity while ICE officers took the criminal aliens into custody. In addition to being frisked by ICE officers, they placed at least one of the criminals in shackles

One of the parolees, Hector Rivera, told the NBC reporter, “I turn back around again and I saw the big coach bus and I said ‘dude that’s ICE’.”

“They were really nervous, ‘oh my God,’ ‘oh my kid’ and everything,” Rivera continued. “Some were saying ‘oh we got to run’.”

ICE officials declined to comment specifically on the operation. North Texas ICE spokesman issued a statement in which he wrote, “ICE officers are conducting ongoing immigration enforcement operations in North Texas. No further details are available until the conclusion of this operation. ICE routinely conducts immigration enforcement operations locally and nationwide which help improve overall public safety by removing criminal aliens from our communities.”

An immigration attorney told the local NBC affiliate that some of the people will “probably find relief in the immigration court.” He admitted others might face deportation for their crimes.

Chris Coons (D-DE) said he thought it was unlikely President Donald Trump’s nominee for the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Federal Judge Neil Gorsuch, would get the needed 60 votes required by Senate rules for his confirmation.

That according to host Joe Scarborough would almost certainly mean Senate Republican leadership scrapping the 60-vote threshold filibuster-defeating requirement and implementing the nuclear option, which would lower the threshold to a simple 51-vote majority.

Coons said such a move by Senate Republicans would be “tragic.”

Partial transcript as follows:

SCARBOROUGH: Let’s me ask you a couple of quick policy questions. First of all, Gorsuch. I’m disappointed in a lot of what I’m hearing. I know Gorsuch, obviously, follows Garland and the Republicans acted in an abhorrent manner on Garland, but is that any reason for us to not give Gorsuch a fair look?

COONS: Well, Gorsuch got what Garland didn’t, which — a fair hearing. He got a full four days of hearings last week. I questioned him vigorously, some would say aggressively. And he is a charming man. He’s got a good resume. He’s got strong qualifications in terms of his education —

SCARBOROUGH: Right.

COONS: — and service on the court but he would be, by some measures, the most conservative justice on the Supreme Court.

SCARBOROUGH: So, should he deserve an up or down vote in the Senate?

COONS: He will get an up or down vote. Senator Schumer, our minority leader, has said it’s going to be a 60-vote margin and I doubt he’s going to get 60 votes. And the question then, Joe, becomes what do we do? There’s a lot of finger-pointing. There’s a lot of Democrats justifiably still very mad about the treatment of Merrick Garland.

SCARBOROUGH: Obviously, yes, but do you not think we’re going to get to 60 votes?

COONS: I don’t think he’s going to get 60 votes.

SCARBOROUGH: For cloture?

COONS: No.

SCARBOROUGH: All right. Well, so then the Republicans are going to pass it using the so-called nuclear option.

COONS: Almost certainly, and I think this is tragic. And in talking to friends on both sides of the aisle we’ve got a lot of senators concerned about where we’re headed. There’s Republicans still very mad at us over the 2013 change to the filibuster rule. We’re mad at them about shutting down the government. They’re mad at us about Gorsuch and we are not headed in a good direction. I’m very concerned about where we’re headed.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b13856a8c:30a1ddd:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan currently wields significant power but “no accountability,” claiming that the upcoming April 16 referendum is designed to change that, during a sit-down interview with Breitbart News at the National Press Club in D.C. on Tuesday.

“The current constitution gives a lot of powers to the president, but without any accountability and any responsibility, and no judicial supervision,” Çavuşoğlu said. He stated that the referendum would both place greater responsibility on the president while increasing the power of Parliament. He also claimed that “the president will be [held] accountable” and that he will be vested with a large amount of responsibility should the referendum pass. “The power will go to the people, not anybody else,” Çavuşoğlu said.

He argued that, currently, Turkey does not have separation of powers between the government and the parliament but that with the new system, that separation of power will be “clear.” Some have argued that the referendum consolidates power and could arguably give too much power to one person.

However, Çavuşoğlu said, “Parliament will check the power of the president,” and “the current parliament cannot check the activities or decisions of the president. But with the new system, the parliament will” be able to check President Erdoğan.

Erdoğan called upon his supporters to assert themselves last July when certain elements of the Turkish military attempted what became a failed coup against his government. “I urge the Turkish people to convene at public squares and airports,” Erdogan said over a live video streaming app and FaceTime from an undisclosed safe place in an interview with a Turkish TV network. “Let them do what they will at public squares and airports.” He added, “There is no power higher than the power of the people.”

Just eight months before the coup, Erdoğan’s party won nearly 50 percent of the vote. That popularity, particularly among Turkish millennials, and Erdoğan’s desire to maintain it may also be seen as the reason behind his government’s decision to lower the age of candidacy for a parliamentary position by seven years, from 25 to 18. The referendum will also increase the number of MPs from 550 to 600.

However, Erdoğan’s party, the AK Party, won reelection after he called for a second general election in November 2015, after his party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years in June of that same year. Several days after the second election, Erdoğan said, “I don’t care if they call me a dictator or whatever else It goes in one ear, out the other.”

Leaders of the People’s Democratic Party (HDP), a Turkish left-wing minority party allied with the Kurdish population, alleged that the November 1 election was not a “free and equal election” and had even demanded the nation’s Supreme Election Board cancel the results.

Çavuşoğlu told Breitbart News on Tuesday that the upcoming referendum is facing a different obstacle. He said some in the Western media had decided to intervene in the politics of the Turkish referendum at the EU, and that this “had very negative, for them, impact. So, our ‘yes’ vote has been increased after such involvement or intervention by media and politicians in some western countries.”

“I don’t think they are taking sides because they love Turkey [or] they are fan[s] of Muslims [or] they are thinking of the future of Turkey and the stability of Turkey,” Çavuşoğlu said. He condemned both American and international media – “the same media, in the United States and in Europe, which has left ideology” – for having “taken sides” against Erdoğan regarding the referendum.

Çavuşoğlu claimed that the enemies of Erdoğan were also the enemies of U.S. President Donald Trump and “other strong right-wing politicians.” He added, “they hate strong, right-wing governments.”

While President Erdoğan represents the Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) and promoted initiatives to introduce Islamic prayers at the Hagia Sophia and popularize the hijab, President Trump has broken with his predecessors in the Obama administration by calling “radical Islamic terrorism” by its name and implementing policies aimed at targeting Islamist terrorism, which have branded him an “Islamophobe” by many in the mainstream media.

When the conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus reunite in Washington, D.C. this week, they will have an unprecedented opportunity. It is the legislative equivalent of an empty net in hockey — when the opposing team brings its goalie into the attack, leaving its own goal undefended.

That is what happened in the push for the American Health Care Act, when President Donald Trump threw his weight behind Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership.

The president’s agenda is not dead, contrary to wishful thinking by the Democratic Party and its mainstream media chorus. But for the moment, there is a legislative vacuum on health care.

Democrats have no answer to the problems of Obamacare and have not yet presented any of the “fixes” to which they suddenly pretend they are now open. House Republican leaders have been chastened by their loss, and want to focus on tax reform. The policy wonks of Northwest D.C. are very quiet.

Now would be a perfect opportunity for conservative Republicans to unite behind a plan to repeal Obamacare. They could propose a simple, one-page repeal bill, effective at some future date, which would provide time to negotiate Obamacare’s replacement and make repeal the default if those talks fail. They could revive the repeal bill that passed the last Congress. They could also produce a new repeal-and-replace package that could later be pushed through reconciliation in the Senate.

Right now, there is no alternative to whatever the Freedom Caucus would propose — if they can settle on a good plan. The White House might be inclined to sign whatever can make it through Congress, and moderate Republicans might be shamed into backing the same legislation they voted for in the past, or some variant thereof.

There is no opposition at the moment, no goaltender. There is just an empty net — where even a long slapshot from the defense, if aimed correctly, could score.

Update: A reader points out an important nuance of hockey rules.

You&apos;re right–in hockey they substitute an attacking player for the goalie first. It&apos;s just a metaphor but nations have gone to war for less https://t.co/JCQQLyayAp — Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) March 28, 2017

An ally of Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) breached protocol when he accused Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, of working in league with House Democrats to protect the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

“Mark Meadows betrayed Trump and America and supported Pelosi and Dems to protect Obamacare,” read Austin’s re-Tweet of a Tweet by Rep. Sean Mahoney (D-NY), who was a senior staffer in the White House of President Bill Clinton.

.@realDonaldTrump, @SpeakerRyan: we&apos;re not tired of winning yet. Ready when you are to talk real solutions to fix ACA for American people. pic.twitter.com/GSaXnYg498 — Sean Patrick Maloney (@RepSeanMaloney) March 24, 2017

Mark Meadows betrayed Trump and America and supported Pelosi and Dems to protect Obamacare. https://t.co/zjcfmMhs9P — Rep. Austin Scott (@AustinScottGA08) March 25, 2017

Scott was one of the supporters of the speaker’s American Health Care Act, which was crafted privately by the speaker’s staff, selected lawmakers, and according to Breitbart News reporting, representatives of the insurance industry. Ryan released the text of the bill on March 6 and he ushered it through the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget committees without a single Republican amendment proposed nor a single Democratic amendment approved.

Capitol Hill conservatives asked to be part of the process, but they were dismissed.

When the bill was going through the committees and heading to the House floor, conservatives were told there was only one bill under consideration and that they had a “binary choice,” either vote to rescue Obamacare or not.

Friday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported:

Some were willing to pin the blame of the bill’s collapse on the hard-line members of the House Freedom Caucus, the main group of holdouts. Many members of the conservative group wouldn’t bite on the legislation, even after leaders made eleventh-hour changes Thursday to pull back on Obamacare’s “essential health benefits,” one of their key asks. “I guess people who like Obamacare can thank the Freedom Caucus,” Rep. Austin Scott, R-Tifton, said minutes after the decision to pull the legislation was announced. “People who wanted us to replace it should know that the majority of us were trying to do the right thing and get a new piece of legislation passed.”

Scott was one of the first Republicans to support Ryan for speaker in the fall of 2o15, before Ryan announced he was in the running, when he told Albany, Georgia WFXL-TV:

He said he thinks it’s more important to get it right than to get it fast.

Scott said he believes the votes are there to make U.S. Representative Paul Ryan the next Speaker of the House and he supports Ryan in running for the seat.

In the context of Capitol Hill dynamics, it would be strange for an ally of the speaker to attack a fellow Republican or a group of Republicans with considering the assumption that his attack was approved by the speaker.

Scott’s Tweet is also in line with Ryan’s spin from Friday that conservatives were the reason why he pulled the bill.

“I don’t want to cast blame, there is a bloc of No-votes that we had that is why this didn’t pass, there were a sufficient number of votes that prevented it from passing and they didn’t change their votes,” the speaker said at his Friday 4 p.m. press conference, held just as the vote would have been wrapping up on the House floor had it gone forward.

The bloc of No-votes that didn’t change is a direct reference to the House Freedom Caucus, whose lock on north of 25 No-votes was enough to keep Ryan from the 216 votes he needed, assuming none of the 193 House Democrats crossed the aisle to save the bill.

What Ryan did not refer to was the bloc of votes that had supported the bill and were flaking off.

These were the moderates, mainly members of the Tuesday Group caucus, who started to leave Monday, after the speaker allowed slight changes in the wording of the American Health Care Act, along with a work requirement and changes in the formula New York State uses to allocate Medicaid costs. The moderate House Republicans were told they had to go along with defunding Planned Parenthood, but they were not ready for Ryan to take out the individual abortion tax credit was part of the original AHCA, also.

While Meadows continued to negotiate with President Donald Trump, prominent moderates, such as Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA), the leader of the Tuesday Group, and the highest ranking No-vote Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) announced they were no longer supporting the bill.

By Thursday night the whole bill was stuck. Any concession to Republicans on the left lost votes from the right. Any concession on the right lost votes on the left.

House Republican leadership pushed off the vote from Thursday to Friday because the House Rules Committee had suspended consideration of the AHCA in anticipation of new changes in the language. When Rules finally passed the final text, the significant change was the modification of the Essential Health Benefits provision in Obamacare, the rule that means there are benefits plans are required to carry.

The modification was not enough to win conservative votes and the moderates started for the exits, rather than risk a tough political bill that was certainly going to fail, enough of them pulled away, so that Ryancare not just going to lose, it was going to lose big.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b12fbd3ad:2b9341d:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

If the latest polls are correct, it looks like no candidate in the crowded April 18 special election to replace Rep. Tom Price, now Secretary of Health and Human Services, in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District will win a majority, and the top two candidates will meet in a June 20 runoff.

“Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel (pictured) are beginning to distance themselves from the crowded field in Georgia’s special election, according to a Fox 5 Atlanta poll,” the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported on Sunday:

The poll, conducted by Opinion Savvy, showed Ossoff leading the 18-candidate field with 40 percent of the vote and Handel at 20 percent. The top two vote-getters in the April 18 special election are headed to a likely June 20 runoff. The poll showed a trio of other Republicans are essentially tied for third place – Bob Gray, Judson Hill and Dan Moody all tallied between 8 to 10 points – while the rest of the candidates combined for about 6 percent of the vote. It found only 6 percent were undecided. Most Republicans now concede Ossoff, a 30-year-old former Congressional aide, will land one of the two runoff spots. But the poll underscores the challenges ahead for the other Republicans scrambling to outlast Handel.

Eighteen total candidates in both parties have qualified for the “jungle primary” special election to be held on April 18. Eleven are Republicans, five are Democrats, and two are Independents.

According to the Atlanta Constitution, the eleven Republican candidates are:

David Abroms (R): A business executive and former congressional aide. Mohammad Ali Bhuiyan (R): A Cobb County economist who aims to be the first Muslim Republican in the U.S. House. Keith Grawert (R): A U.S. Air Force pilot and Dunwoody resident who wants to “return public service to Washington.” Bob Gray (R): A former Johns Creek councilman who is running as a “willing partner” with President Donald Trump. Karen Handel (R): The ex-Georgia secretary of state has statewide name recognition after running in 2010 for governor and 2014 for the U.S. Senate. Judson Hill (R): The former state senator who represented an east Cobb-based district was the first Republican in the race. Amy Kremer (R): A Republican activist who qualified just before the deadline on Wednesday. Bruce LeVell (R): A Sandy Springs executive who was head of Trump’s diversity coalition. William Llop (R): A Sandy Springs accountant who said he will run as a “financial expert.” Dan Moody (R): Once a state senator, Moody is a U.S. Army veteran who is now a Johns Creek executive. Kurt Wilson (R): A Roswell small business owner and staunch supporter of term limits.

If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote that day, then a runoff election between the top two vote getters will be held on June 20.

The district went for President Trump narrowly in the November election, and most observers expect Republican voters to rally around whichever Republican qualifies for the two person runoff if Democrat Ossof is the other to make the cut on April 18.

Former Tea Party Express Chairman Amy Kremer says the GOP establishment in Georgia is boxing out a number of qualified candidates in the Sixth Congressional District special from Sunday’s debate.

The 6th Congressional District GOP Committee is hosting a debate Sunday night in the suburban Atlanta district, but is only inviting five of the party’s eleven qualified candidates. Kremer is one of the six GOP candidates not invited.

That exclusion does not sit well with Kremer, who is one of the six qualified Republican candidates who have been kept out of the debate.

“The 6th district GOP ignored the math of the polls and handpicked the participants to the first GOP debate held at Indian Hills Country Club on the eve of early voting,” the Kremer campaign said in a statement released on Sunday.

“Amy Kremer has been excluded from the debate based upon the whim of the 6th district GOP. Kremer’s campaign demands that the GOP clean up the corruption and immediately conduct a fair and unbiased election on behalf of all Republicans running for office in the 6th district,” the statement continued:

6th district Chairman Michael Fitzgerald has said that the debate would include “the top 5 Republican candidates chosen by the average of the then most recent polls –much like the Real Clear Politics Average”- prior to the event. Fitzgerald stated that the polls used were the Fox 5/Opinion Savvy poll (3/22-23) , Clout/Zpolitics poll (3/15-16) and the Trafalgar poll (3/2-3rd),” the statement added, then showed its own calculation that, by those polls, Amy Kremer ranked fifth and should have been included.

According to the Kremer campaign, the average of the three polls shows the following:

Three Poll Average 6th CD Special Election Candidates Candidate Average Rank Handel 17.99 1 Gray 13.14 2 Hill 8.89 3 Moody 5.07 4 Kremer 1.09 5 Abroms 1.07 6 Wilson 0.63 7 Source: Kremer Campaign

“The five candidates who have been invited to attend the debate are Bob Gray, Dan Moody, Judson Hill, Kurt Wilson, and David Abroms,” Kremer tells Breitbart News.

“None of them are original Trump supporters,” she adds.

Karen Handel, who leads all polls and Kremer, both of whom are in Kremer’s top five poll averages, were apparently not invited to participate in Sunday’s debate.

“I have never seen anything like this in my life,” Kremer says.

“Bruce LeVell are I are the two candidates in this race that have been on board with Trump from Day One. Bruce headed up President Trump’s diversity coalition.”

“I want to be in the debate tonight. I want transparency. The GOP is trying to manipulate the voters and control who wins this seat. They’re trying to push the Trump people out,” Kremer concludes.

“Might I suggest you be VERY careful about what you hear from Ms. Kremer,” 6th Congressional District GOP Chair Michael Fitzgerald responded to a Breitbart News request to respond to Kremer’s allegations late Sunday.

“Attached is the report that was openly distributed at the debate. It was developed by two career statisticians that analyzed the available data to make a determination who should participate in our debate,” Fitzgerald said.

“Did Ms. Kremer tell you she didn’t rate above the margin of error collecting only ONE vote out of 462?” Fitzgerald asked.

The attached report provided to Breitbart News by Fitzgerald contained this description of the analysis:

As we were looking for 6 participants (to replace one candidate that formally withdrew from only the initial debate), we considered anyone within the poll’s margin of error of 5%.

In the OpinionSavvy Poll, Republican candidates David Abroms and Kurt Wilson had statistically viable 7 votes (1.6%) and 9 votes (1.8%), respectively. Falling below the Margin of Error, Bruce LeVell (0.4%) received only one vote more than Amy Kremer and Llop, whom both registered one vote in the poll.Two candidates failed to register any votes from any of the polls: Bhylyan and Grawert Conclusively, David Abroms and Kurt Wilson were included in the top six candidates.

It is worthy and bares note that in each of the above listed polls, the top 4 Republican candidates were exactly the same and generally in the same order which provides some measure of statistical validation.Our analysis needs to emphasize that we had to make the best judgment with the criteria available and qualifying conditions forecasted and set in January/February. It is not scientifically fool proof because polls can never account for pure sampling variability (or, generally speaking, non-sampling error), but the

polls allowed us to make solid and guided decisions of who to include in the initial debate.

On March 6, the Trafalgar Group released this statement about a poll it conducted between March 2 and March 3:</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b12fbd3ad:2b9341c:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On March 26, the New York Times Magazine described Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) as “the Senate Democrat who… seems closest to [President] Trump” and who believes he may actually secure gun control under the Trump administration.

This news comes as Trump, the NRA, and others are pressing red state Democrats to confirm Neil Gorsuch to fill the void left by Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.

According to the NYT Mag, Manchin appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on December 14, 2016, the 4th anniversary of the heinous attack in which 20-year-old Adam Lanza stole guns, killed his mother, then went to Sandy Hook Elementary and killed 26 more innocents. While on air, Manchin again voiced support for his pet gun control item — an expansion of background checks in response to the Sandy Hook attack.

Within an hour after his segment ended, Manchin received a phone call from Donald Trump. And while he did not divulge details of the call, he told NYT Mag reporter Robert Draper that he believes he has “a complete opportunity” to secure gun control under Trump.

Draper said Manchin believes his gun control has a chance it never had under Barack Obama because “no one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights.” The problem with this claim is that Manchin’s gun control — universal background checks- – cripples gun rights by coupling private sales with retail sales and forcing Americans to seek out an agent of the state for permission to conduct either kind of sale. Moreover, history — even recent history — has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that universal background checks are insidious; they lead to more and more gun control and especially to a gun registry.

In fact, universal background checks cannot work without a gun registry. Think about it — how can the government be sure no guns are changing hands privately unless they know where every gun is and the name of everyone who owns it? This is exactly why the implementation of universal background checks in California has been followed by gun registration requirements. Moreover, it is why more and more gun controls that involve paperwork continue to be passed in that state; the hope is to discover guns that have not made it onto the state database of gun owners yet.

The newly passed background checks for ammunition purchases is one way California is broadening the paper trail. Someone who may have a gun they got from their grandfather — a gun that has no paper trail at all — can eventually be found when he goes to buy ammunition and has to go through the background check system Californians go through for every gun sale. It is a constricting circle, and it is the very circle Manchin has been pushing for all Americans since January 2013.

One more problem with Manchin’s universal background checks — they have nothing to do with the attack on Sandy Hook. As noted above, the Sandy Hook attacker stole his guns. In fact, even Manchin admitted his universal background checks would not have stopped the attack had they been in place. Manchin made this admission during the April 14, 2013, airing CBS News’s Face the Nation.

Manchin is a Democrat from a pro-gun, red state that President Trump won handily. He is pushing gun control, and West Virginians need to remember he is up for re-election in 2018.

Former Florida governor and 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush said Sunday that President Trump is making life harder for himself.

“He should stop saying things that aren’t true, that are distractions from the task at hand,” Bush told WFOR’s Jim DeFede in an interview on Facing South Florida.

“He’s a distraction in and of himself,” he continued. “He’s got a lot of work to do, and some of these things — the wiretapping and all of this stuff — is a complete distraction that makes it harder to accomplish the things I know he wants to do.”

DeFede asked Bush whether Trump accusing former President Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower tarnished the office of the president, to which Bush replied, “A little bit.”

He added that Trump “hasn’t shifted to being president in the way that people are used to, and I think that’s the problem.”

Bush also praised the president for his choice of Cabinet picks, especially Rex Tillerson, Betsy DeVos, and John Kelly.

“The president made some really good appointments,” Bush said. “He’s acted decisively on some areas I think are important, particularly on the regulatory side.”

When DeFede asked him about his political future, Bush said he would not “rule out anything,” but also said he is happy as a private citizen.

Bush said he did not regret running for office in 2016, but felt his personality did not click with voters.

“Reasoning, in this environment where people are angry, is hard, and I wasn’t capable of giving them a sense that there is a better path,” he said.

According to the Miami Herald, the WFOR interview was the first in-depth local interview Bush gave since he dropped out of the 2016 Republican presidential primary.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b12e05114:2b70909:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Members of rock band Green Day revealed to Rolling Stone in an extensive interview Monday that they shout “F*ck you, Donald Trump” at every stop on their nationwide tour while performing the title track from their 2004 album “American Idiot.”

“I feel we’re a voice to join the resistance. I don’t know what shape or form that’s going to come in. I mean, you can see a little bit of that now with people showing up at town halls,” guitarist and lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Rolling Stone. “But it’s hard. To think we’re only in the second month of this presidency. It’s like every day you’re fed a different form of bullsh*t. I think that’s what people are: They’re victims of constant bullsh*t.”

Asked if he views George W. Bush’s presidency differently now that he’s living in the era of Trump, Armstrong said: “No. Bush, as far as I’m concerned, is a war criminal. With Trump, we have no idea. Right now it’s just a freak show.”

“I feel like the government is trying to create a culture war between us in a lot of ways. They’re trying to get between your average citizens based on red and blue,” Armstrong added. “I want people to feel unity when they come to a show. At the same time, I’m not going to puss out on saying what I feel about him and his administration.”

Armstrong and Green Day have made a habit of bashing President Trump.

In an interview with Kerrang! magazine last August, Armstrong compared Trump to Adolf Hitler. In a November interview with NME, the rocker blamed the rise of Trump on “uneducated white working-class people.”

Later that month during a performance at the American Music Awards, the rock trio chanted “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!” from the stage.

In his new interview with Rolling Stone, Armstrong said he doesn’t fear for his children’s future under Trump and appeared to compare the president to the Harry Potter villain Voldemort.

“I look at my kids as the Harry Potter Generation,” Armstrong said. “There’s a sense of justice about that, in beating Voldemort. It’s a classic tale of good versus evil. To have a role model like Harry Potter that says you can defeat evil, but still be a complicated human being. That gives me a lot of hope.”

Actress Sarah Paulson says she’d like to play President Donald Trump in the upcoming seventh season of American Horror Story.

“I’d like to play Donald Trump,” the Emmy-winning actress told the Hollywood Reporter at PaleyFest on Saturday.

“If Donald Trump is going to be a character in it,” she added. “Why not? That’s an acting challenge to be sure.”

In February, American Horror Story creator and showrunner Ryan Murphy said the seventh season of the horror anthology series would focus on the 2016 presidential race.

“I don’t have a title, but the season that we begin shooting in June is going to be about the election that we just went through,” Murphy told Bravo’s Andy Cohen. Murphy also told THR in an interview that he wants to show “not just the obvious, single-minded point of view but rather express all sides of that equation.”

Paulson — who won an Emmy for her role as real-life prosecutor Marcia Clark in Murphy’s other FX series, The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story – was confirmed as a cast member for Season 7 in February.

However, it appears unlikely the actress would play the actual president in the new series; at the Publicists Guild Awards luncheon last month, Murphy told the audience flatly: “You will not see Trump and [Hillary] Clinton as characters on the show.”

He did, however, hint that he may have another role in mind for Paulson: “Now as I look over at Sarah Paulson, I think of Kellyanne Conway. I don’t know! I might be rewriting!”

Whatever role she ends up playing, Paulson told THR that Murphy will bring his “unique perspective” to the project.

“Whatever the angle he’s going to take, it will be unique, which will make it new, which will make us interested and make our eyes and ears open probably in a way that we hadn’t thought about,” she said.

American Horror Story wrapped its sixth season, Roanoke, in November. The show was renewed by FX in January through Season 9.

Curtis Houck at NewsBusters notes that 60 Minutes’ Sunday report, “How Fake News Becomes a Popular, Trending Topic,” admits that the audience for “fake news” tailored to the left is mostly “affluent and college educated.”

From NewsBusters:

[G]uest and “internet advertising firm” CEO Jeff Green dropped this admission that both he and Pelley seemed befuddled by:

JEFF GREEN: So the first thing that we found out is that it is definitely a phenomenon that affects both sides. PELLEY: Liberals and conservatives? GREEN: Yes. There is no question they’re both affected.

There was yet another surprise in store for these hardcore liberals. After citing a case of left-wing fake news about Congress “plotting to overthrow President Trump,” Green revealed that “fake news readers on the left were more likely to be affluent and college educated.” At the other end, “right-leaning fake news overwhelmingly attracted readers in their 40s and 50s.”

Green admitted that this “shocked me,” and Pelley had a similarly flabbergasted look. Green added that he “thought the same way that many Americans perhaps think is that fake news was a phenomenon that only tricked the uneducated,” but, alas, “not true — just not — the data shows it’s just not true.”

President Trump’s attempts to drain the swamp are being undermined by one of his key administrators.

Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is more interested in building his political career than he is taking on the Green Blob, insiders report.

Pruitt is also said to be behind attempts to remove at least one of the key phrases from the president’s long-awaited Executive Order on the environment.

It concerns a proposal to repeal the EPA’s Endangerment Finding on CO2 (the disastrous, unscientific, job-killing ruling introduced during the Obama Administration, which rebranded the harmless trace gas Carbon Dioxide as a dangerous substance).

If Pruitt is successful and this clause is removed from the Executive Order it will represent a major setback for President Trump’s war with the Climate Industrial Complex. It may also put into jeopardy the promises Trump made on the campaign trail to scrap “any regulation that is outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers, or contrary to the national interest.”

“This is the president’s one shot at winning this battle,” an ally in the EPA camp warns. “It’s like the French heavy cavalry at Agincourt: lose momentum and he’s going to get stuck in the mud being shot to pieces by the English longbows.”

To understand the background to this story, you need to know who Scott Pruitt is and how he landed such a key job. The dismantling of the EPA, after all, is a core part of Trump’s swamp-draining program — so clearly it mattered greatly that the Administrator’s position should go to a capable, determined figure.

Pruitt, a Republican lawyer, the Attorney General of Oklahoma seemed ideally qualified. One of his biographies describes him as a “leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda.” It was because of his combative track record — challenging his state’s rights against the federal bureaucracy of the EPA — that he landed the post of EPA Administrator.

Since taking on the position, though, his appetite for doing what he was appointed to do appears to have diminished somewhat. True, his credentials as a climate sceptic are not much in doubt. Yes, he might even agree with President Trump that there’s a swamp out there that sorely needs draining. The problem is, insiders explain, is that the future of the EPA is of far less interest to Pruitt than his prospects of becoming either one of Oklahoma’s next senators or its next governor.

“Pruitt wants to keep himself in the middle of the road so he can get himself elected,” one of my sources explains. “He’s not interested in managing the agency; he’s interested in running for the senate; and though of course he’s committed to the conservative cause, he’s more committed to himself.”

Of a piece with this was his recent spat with Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, over the EPA’s budget allowance.

Pruitt — supposed to be a hawk — protested that he couldn’t accept the proposed 24 percent cut in the EPA’s $8.2 billion budget. A furious Mulvaney responded by increasing the cut to 31 percent.

Incurring Mulvaney’s wrath, my sources tell me, was all part of the plan. “It made Pruitt look like the guy who sticks up for his people. A good look for someone running for senator of Oklahoma.”

Meanwhile, most of the actual running of the EPA has been deputed to Pruitt’s Chief of Staff Ryan Jackson. Like Pruitt, like many in the upper circles of the EPA, Jackson is a member of the Oklahoma political set. He cut his teeth as an aide to Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe who, as Chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, has long been a scourge of the Climate Industrial Complex. Jackson often tried to warn off Sen. Inhofe from becoming too outspoken on climate change — not out of reasons of principle but purely as a matter of realpolitik. Sen. Inhofe, however, never gave much of a damn about caution: now 82, he has no reason to make friends and influence people by making out nicey-nice on green issues.

Pruitt, on the other hand, has been much more alive to Jackson’s cautions. He got his fingers quite badly burnt after he recently said on CNBC that he did not consider carbon dioxide to be a major cause of global warming.

At the time, I applauded Pruitt for saying what needed to be said. It was certainly an improvement on his disappointing performance at CPAC a few weeks before when he’d bounded around Tiggerishly repeating his favourite meaningless catchphrase “the future ain’t what it used to be” but proved himself quite incapable of answering a straightforward question about whether he believed in man-made climate change.

But I gather from my sources that there was blowback from the White House (why, it is not clear). This has made Pruitt more determined than ever not to stick his head above the parapet by doing anything that would make him even more unpopular than he is already with the Green Blob and its many fellow travellers in the squish branch of the GOP.

Pruitt’s lip-wobbling could scarcely come at a worse moment for Donald Trump. With his attempt to repeal Obamacare in temporary disarray, he badly needs a clear victory on one of his other battlefronts — not company commanders abandoning their positions at the very moment his flanks are most in danger.

Already, the president has enough trouble on the environment front from other members of his inner circle. Both his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner are true believers in the green faith and, like his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have argued for the tone of the President’s Executive Order on the environment to be softened.

If the clause on the Endangerment Finding is removed from the Executive Order, attempts will be made by Pruitt and others to pretend that this isn’t a problem. What matters is all the stuff President Trump is definitely going to do, like cancel Obama’s Clean Power Plan and putting the Paris climate agreement to the Senate so they can overturn it.

But this is disingenuous and misleading.

The Endangerment Finding isn’t some negligible, easily circumnavigable piece of legislation. It was deliberately introduced by environmentalist zealots at the height of the Obama administration as the poison pill which would cripple U.S. industry by rebranding “greenhouse gases,” including CO2, as a pollutant. This gives environmental lawyers carte blanche to sue any U.S. administration that fails properly to combat this alleged menace.

Yet as Cato’s Pat Michaels explained in his lunchtime presentation at the Heartland Institute Climate Conference last week, the Endangerment Finding is based on an entirely flawed premise.

It presupposes that the various computer models used to predict dangerous climate change as a result of rising man-made CO2 levels are reliable and accurate. They are not. With time, the divergence between projected warming and observed warming has grown bigger, not smaller. This means, effectively, that the EPA’s Endangerment Finding declaration has no credible scientific basis whatsoever.

In other words, the environmental movement has strayed so far beyond the realms of science that it has created several barn-door-sized targets for any administration brave enough to take it on. This is an argument that can be won many times over: on the science; on the economics; even on the environment itself — which is being caused untold damage by misguided policies supposedly designed to save it.

But what President Trump needs now more than ever are administrators with the political will to do the right thing — which is, after all, the reason so many Americans voted for him.

If Scott Pruitt is not up to that task, then maybe it’s about time he did the decent thing and handed over the reins to someone who is.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b11e88293:2e5af13:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Scott Pelley, host of CBS News’ 60 Minutes, embarrassed himself in a Sunday segment about “fake news” — despite having the final cut on a hostile interview with a right-wing activist.

Mike Cernovich — a lawyer, independent blogger/author/filmmaker, and a dominant voice on Twitter — built up significant buzz for 60 Minutes by revealing on Thursday he had granted Pelley a sit-down interview. In the hours before the live broadcast, Cernovich anticipated that the 45-minute conversation would be “selectively edited” and pre-emptively published a partial transcript.

That concern is based on a long history of network news programs using misleading or downright comical editing to put conservatives in the worst possible light. As the segment aired, Pelley’s opening statement made it clear this story was a smear job:

In this last election, the nation was assaulted by impostors masquerading as reporters. They poisoned the conversation with lies on the left and on the right. Many did it to influence the outcome — others just to make a buck. The president uses the term “fake news” to discredit responsible reporting that he doesn’t like. But we’re going to show you how con artists insert truly fake news into the national conversation with fraudulent software that scams your social media account. The stories are fake, but the consequences are real. [emphasis added]

Later on, Pelley introduced Cernovich with b-roll depicting him, rather unsubtly, like a little boy hunched over his laptop — calling him “a magnet for readers with a taste for stories with no basis in fact”:

Even with this heavy-handed setup, Pelley ended up humiliating himself — not his target.

Watch the key exchange:

That story got so much traction, it had to be denied not only by Clinton’s doctor, but by the National Parkinson’s Foundation. (2/2) pic.twitter.com/SLu19bN6Gr — 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) March 27, 2017

Pelley brought up an article on Cernovich’s website where a physician, who later outed himself as Orlando anesthesiologist Dr. Ted Noel, argued that an explanation for Clinton’s bizarre physical tics could be Parkinson’s disease. While confronting Cernovich about the oversold headline (“Hillary Clinton Has Parkinson’s Disease, Physician Confirms”), Pelley exposed his own credulous belief in an unproven claim:

Cernovich: She had a seizure and froze up walking into her motorcade that day [September 11, 2016]. Pelley: Well, she had pneumonia. I mean— Cernovich: How do you know? Who told you that? Pelley: Well, the campaign told us that. Cernovich: Why would you trust the campaign? Pelley: The point is you didn’t talk to anybody who’d ever examined Hillary Clinton. Cernovich: I don’t take anything Hillary Clinton is gonna say at all as true. I’m not gonna take her on her word. The media says we’re not gonna take Donald Trump on his word. And that’s why we are in these different universes.

Pelley has no answer for those six words — “Why would you trust the campaign” — as his entire profession goes berserk with literal-minded fact checks for every tweet from President Trump. Pelley also seems to forget the fakery that Clinton World attempted hours before its pneumonia statement — with the candidate smiling and waving outside her daughter’s apartment, greeting a little girl, and assuring reporters everything was a-okay.

Clinton just left her daughters apartment. When asked how she was feeling, Clinton said, &quot;Great. I&apos;m feeling great.&quot; — Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) September 11, 2016

Cernovich’s followers — and even some of his biggest detractors — declared the interview a loss for Pelley:

…and you can see it in the exact moment Cernovich flipped the interview on Pelley pic.twitter.com/R6ZfsUrwBH — Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) March 27, 2017

@mattdpearce pelley was surprisingly unprepared — Will Sommer (@willsommer) March 27, 2017

Cernovich is a crazy person and a con man but Pelley walked right into that buzzsaw. — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) March 27, 2017

shamefully stupid piece connecting cernovich to people who buy twitter bots — noah kulwin (@nkulw) March 27, 2017

@occhipig Pelley&apos;s response sucked but he&apos;s responding to an item WITH NO BASIS IN FACT. But I&apos;m honestly not here to convince you. — Richard Deitsch (@richarddeitsch) March 27, 2017

Charlie Warzel of BuzzFeed said Pelley “didn’t do his homework on Cernovich… And it showed, despite the fact that CBS got to edit down the video [emphasis added].”

Cernovich has since published another partial transcript of his conversation with Pelley and called for CBS to release the full video, crediting his appearance with bumping the show’s recent average of 10.8 million viewers to somewhere between 14 and 16 million viewers.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b11e88293:2e5af11:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he is cracking down on sanctuary cities; cutting billions of dollars in law enforcement grants.

The Department of Justice will hand out $4 billion in federal law enforcement grants over the balance of this fiscal year which ends in September. Sessions told reporters at the White House he will be working to prevent any of it from going to sanctuary jurisdictions, The Washington Times reported.

“Countless Americans would be alive today … if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended,” General Sessions told reporters. The AG stated he is using a tactic that began under AG Loretta Lynch.

Not only can the Attorney General withhold grants from this year’s funding requests, the DOJ can actually claw back grants made in prior years to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with immigration officials, U.S. Representative John Culberson (R-TX) told Breitbart Texas.

Culberson began working on defunding sanctuary jurisdictions with then-Attorney General Lynch, Breitbart Texas reported in December. Using the “power of the purse” entrusted to Congress, Culberson told a group of supporters in December that he has been able to “step on the air hose” of Obama’s DOJ and force the certification of ten sanctuary jurisdictions as not being in compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, an existing law that requires 100 percent cooperation from local and state jurisdictions in order to receive DOJ grant funding. That law was signed by President Bill Clinton in the 1980s to force local jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration officers.

“99 percent is not good enough,” Culberson stated. “These jurisdictions must cooperate 100 percent in order to qualify for these DOJ grants. They must choose between protecting illegal aliens and receiving federal funds.”

The DOJ Office of Inspector General previously certified 10 jurisdictions as not being in compliance with that law and eligible for cuts in funding:

The State of Connecticut

The State of California

Orleans Parish, Louisiana

New York City

Philadelphia

Cook County, Illinois

Miami-Dade County, Florida

Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Clark County, Nevada

These 10 jurisdictions received 65 percent of the law enforcement grants allocated in FY2015 as of March 2016.

“It is not just future funds that are at risk for these sanctuary jurisdictions,” Culberson told Breitbart Texas. “The DOJ can force them to reimburse funds received from these grant programs in the past. This means, the State of California could be forced to repay the more than $3 billion in grants received over the past 10 years.”

The AG announced three funding programs that will be cut from sanctuary jurisdictions this year. Those include the COPS, Byrne, and State Criminal Alien Assistance Program grants.

Last week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials began releasing a report showing criminal aliens released by sanctuary jurisdictions after immigration officers placed holds on inmates. Texas led the nation with well over 70 percent of those released. In the initial report covering January 25 through February 3, 206 criminal aliens were released. Many of these are violent felons.

The jurisdictions listed in this report could find themselves ineligible to receive grants this year.

Following President Donald Trump’s January announcement calling for a crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions, Miami-Dade County immediately reversed course and rescinded its sanctuary policy, Breitbart News’ Katie McHugh reported. “I want to make sure we don’t put in jeopardy the millions of funds we get from the federal government for a $52,000 issue,” Mayor Carlos Giménez stated. “It doesn’t mean that we’re going to be arresting more people. It doesn’t mean that we’re going to be enforcing any immigration laws,” he added.

On Saturday, in the wake of the failure of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s American Health Care Act (AHCA), President Trump tweeted , “ ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!”

Okay, so let’s take a closer look at the President’s message. He made two points: First, Obamacare will “explode” because of excess costs; and second, that his administration will yet find a way to develop “a great healthcare plan” that’s presumably a good deal different from what we’re seeing now.

So let’s look at each point in turn; in this installment, we’ll look at the “explode” question, and in next installment, we’ll examine possible alternatives.

Will Obamacare, as Trump says, “explode”? It is true that costs in some places are spiraling, even as coverage is shrinking. As the President said in his February 28 address to Congress:

Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state, the state of Kentucky, and it’s unsustainable and collapsing.

However, these troubles are not evident everywhere. As The New York Times rushed to report, Arizona was the outlier; nationwide, the increase in the benchmark plan was “only” 22 percent. That is, a double-digit increase, not triple-digit.

Either way, to be sure, they are big increases. And thus the Democrats suffer from continuing vulnerability on the Obamacare issue. That is, they and their program have failed completely to uphold Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign promise to cut the average family’s annual healthcare bill by $2500. Instead, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average cost of family insurance premiums has risen from $13,375 in 2009 (the first year that Obama was in office) to $18,142 in 2016. In other words, instead of the promised 20 percent reduction, American families have faced a 35 percent increase.

Yet even so, the American people are cautiously supportive of Obamacare; at least, they like it more than they dislike it. According to the latest RealClearPolitics polling average, 48 percent approve of the law, while 43.8 percent disapprove of it.

Indeed, support for Obamacare has risen substantially in the last year. Evidently, the prospect of the program actually being repealed has forced Americans to ask themselves if they really want the program to go away—and the answer has been “no.” House Republicans had to acknowledge this political reality last week, when they pulled their Obamacare-repealing AHCA.

In fact, if we drill down further into the polling data, we find that Obamacare—or at least the idea of national health insurance—rests on a deep bedrock of public support. In an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted earlier this month, Americans were asked if they agreed or disagreed with this statement:

Health care must be recognized as a right, not a privilege. That is, every man, woman and child should be able to access the health care they need regardless of their income.

A total of 62 percent “strongly” agreed that yes, health care is a right, and 22 percent “somewhat” agreed. Thus we can see: A full 84 percent of us accept the ultimate argument that the Democrats have been making, while just 12 percent accept the libertarian-Republican counter-argument.

Indeed, given those numbers, one can only marvel that the Democrats did so poorly in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, when Obamacare was a front-and-center issue.

So how might we square this circle—that the underlying idea of Obamacare is popular, but not Obamacare itself? As a quick answer, we can presume that the Democrats were done in by the technical defects of the Obamacare plan (the notorious website glitches), as well as its sideshow ideological problems (the Obama administration pushing insurers to pay for sex-change operations).

So the Democrats have some learning to do. The takeaway lesson of the last seven years, for welfare-state architects, is that it’s best to be technically competent and to avoid exotic excesses. That’s why, for example, the meat-and-potatoes essentials of Social Security are safe, politically, even as the complexity that is Obamacare still finds itself in the crosshairs.

In fact, evidence is clear: The American people want a program that helps them feel secure about the basics of their lives, not a program which is the basis for someone else’s theory of avant-garde social experimentation.

Yet at the same time, Republicans, too, have some lessons to learn: To put it bluntly, the voters of this country are not where the the Republican intelligentsia thought they were. That is, all the ideological think-tanking of the last seven years—all the manifestos, road maps, battle plans, and talking points that called for the eradication of Obamacare—all that was just so much vaporizing.

We can further say: The “experts” who wrote that earnest propaganda, living in their fatcat-funded hothouses, never seem to have met an actual voter, or at least not enough of them.

It is, of course, possible to imagine that Republicans could have come up with a true repeal-and-replace bill, one that peeled away the mistakes and excesses of Obamacare while maintaining the essential of affordable care for all citizens. But the latest GOP plan, AHCA, was not it.

Indeed, the reality of the disconnect between Republican theory and political practicality became searingly obvious on March 13, when the Congressional Budget Office concluded that under AHCA, 24 million people would lose their health insurance. At that moment, the bill was doomed; according to a Quinnipiac Poll taken ten days after the CBO finding, just 17 percent of Americans supported AHCA.

Just hours after the bill was pulled on March 24, Charles Krauthammer said on Fox News, “There is now a generalized expectation that there is a an entitlement to universal healthcare.” Or, as House Speaker Paul Ryan reluctantly conceded, “We’re going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.”

But wait, what about the question of Obamacare “exploding”? All those cost increases? Without a doubt, cost increases are going to be a big issue.

And yet here we might pause to note that the insurance-expansion of Obamacare falls into two buckets, and so any solution must deal with both, separately.

The first bucket, and most notoriously, is the Obamacare personal mandate, which was aimed at forcing people into buying health insurance. As we all know, the mandate has been been the emotional crux of the Obamacare fight; millions said, in response, “Don’t tread on me.” Thus the mandate was a prime target of the GOP’s AHCA bill.

Yet interestingly enough, the number of Americans enrolled in the Obamacare “exchanges”—the vehicle through which people were supposed to comply with the mandate—is relatively small: In a country of 320 million, the number of enrollees fluctuates within a range of six million and 11 million (the number changes as people’s status changes—they get new jobs, get married, and so on).

Yes, it’s true: Most of the Obamacare fight over the past decade has been about a program that directly affects only two or three percent of the population.

Meanwhile, it’s this program that has been visibly “exploding” in cost, as Trump has said. Why the explosion? Critics say it’s because the Obama administration deliberately low-balled the cost-estimates in the first place, as a way of making it seem more politically attractive. And yet because prices were set low, health-insurers weren’t much interested in offering plans. Moreover, since there’s been uncertainty over the fate of Obamacare, insurers haven’t been enthusiastic about offering plans. Thus exchange participants have often gotten the worst of both worlds: High prices and little choice.

So how could the problem of the exchanges get fixed? Or at least dealt with?

One possible answer, of course, is a renewed push to repeal the whole program. One diehard is Vice President Mike Pence, who said on Saturday, the day after AHCA died, “The American people want Obamacare gone.”

A second possible answer is additional subsidies as a tweak to the program—or, if one prefers, as a bandaid.

The exchange health plans typically cost a few hundred dollars a month, including existing subsidies. And so if we do the math as to possibly increasing subsidies to keep the program alive, we can arrive at a rough additional cost estimate of $5 billion. To be sure, many will strongly object to any such increase, which can be regarded, through one lens, as a crony-capitalistic subsidy to the health insurers.

So here’s where the Obamacare battle will likely first resume: What to do about about the Obamacare exchanges, now that they have survived the AHCA chopping block? The insurance companies, of course, will make an easy target, as they are unpopular, and yet what about the millions of actual people in the exchanges? Will the political system turn its back on them? Given the American people’s support for universal coverage, that seems unlikely.

We might add that yet another concern is the long-term erosion of health insurance provided by private employers; in the “gig economy,” more and more people will have to find insurance on their own—and that will take them to the exchanges.

Okay, so now to that second bucket of Obamacare, which is the expansion of Medicaid. This program has actually been larger than the Obamacare exchanges; about 12 million people have been added to the program in the last seven years. Interestingly, these new additions were mostly among the working poor; as we know, Medicaid has covered the non-working poor for decades.

Medicaid, too, would have been affected by AHCA, and more than a few Republicans rose to defend it, especially since it was low-income workers—increasingly a core Republican constituency—who would have been most affected. One such defender is Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA); he has been notably energetic in defense of his own blue-collar voters. We can say it’s unlikely that one more think-tank pamphlet will change his reading of his own fellow Louisianans.

Of course, Medicaid is not cheap; in 2015, it spent $545 billion. Does that massive expenditure represent an “explosion” in costs? Or is it simply a piece—admittedly, a big piece—of our overall national health expenditure of nearly $3.5 trillion? To put it mildly, those are questions for further debate.

Yet for now, Medicaid, too, along with the rest of Obamacare, is destined to remain intact.

So where does that leave us? If the legal and fiscal structures of the healthcare status quo seem firmly locked in place, is there anything else that can be done? Is it still possible that President Trump can realize his dream of “a great healthcare plan”?

Will we ever have greatness with Obamacare? Or will we just have more of the same? Is there any possibility of a breakout to something better? Really better?

We’ll take up those questions in part two of this series.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b11e88293:2e5af0f:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Beltway consensus is that President Donald Trump lost so badly by pulling the American Health Care Act last Friday that he has permanently crippled his presidency. He may not achieve anything in his first 100 days (as if he hasn’t already); he may not even last a full term.

You don’t have to believe that Trump plays 3-D chess like a savant to understand that these conclusions are premature, self-serving (especially for NeverTrumpers eager to seize on any stumble), and perhaps wrong.

The fact is that the House Republican bill had to fail for Trump to fulfill his promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare. And there may even be one or two more failures to come. The reason is simple, and derives from the fact that all of the main political factions on Capitol Hill have believed, until now, that they have no reason to negotiate. Democrats cut Republicans out of Obamacare; House Republican ignored Democrats this year; the House Freedom Caucus refused a deal with Trump.

Unless Senate Republicans remove the filibuster for ordinary legislation — and that seems unlikely — it will be necessary to negotiate among all of these factions to produce a final agreement. But first the factions actually have to understand that they cannot go it alone. In negotiation terms, their BATNA — their “best alternative to a negotiated agreement” — must be made intolerable. Trump describes a similar approach in The Art of the Deal. He is slowly making it harder for everyone to refuse.

House Republican leaders now understand that if they fail to reach a deal, they could be replaced, or their party may even lose in 2018. The conservatives of the Freedom Caucus has yet to see their proposals lead debate — and they should — but Trump and moderate Republicans are making it clear that they will be blamed if no legislation passes. Democrats are content to watch for now — but if they refuse to talk, they will lose the best chance to save remnants of Obamacare, a dying policy.

As more people receive premium increases, or lose their insurance coverage, in 2017, pressure will grow on Congress and the White House alike. The anti-war agitation that brought Democrats to power in 2006, and the Tea Party movement that helped Republicans take the House in 2010, might be replaced by anti-incumbent fervor all around. November 2018 will concentrate minds.

Deal-making isn’t rocket science, or 3-D chess. Sometimes you simply lose a round to win in the end.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Vice President Mike Pence addressed a sea of nearly 20,000 people at the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference on Sunday, where he spoke of the “unbreakable” bond between the United States and Israel.

Pence also assured those gathered that his administration would subdue the Iranian regime’s destabilizing efforts in the region, vowing that the atrocities which haunt the Jewish people from the past would never again manifest itself. He also reiterated President Donald Trump’s promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

“After decades of simply talking about it, the President of the United States is giving serious consideration to moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,” Pence said. Last month, Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said his administration was looking at the move “very, very strongly.” He also said, “We’re looking at it with great care.”

Pence noted that while talks between the Israelis and Palestinians would require some compromises, “President Trump will never compromise the safety and security of the Jewish State Israel.”

The Islamic Republic of Iran’s destabilizing efforts in the Middle East have been a major concern for America’s regional allies. But the threat has not been greater for any nation than for Israel, the subject of near-daily death chants at Iranian schools that attempt to indoctrinate youth against the leader of the free world.

The people of Iran, however, are a separate entity from the regime and also suffer under the oppression of the Islamic regime.

“The Ayatollahs in Tehran openly admit their desire to wipe Israel off the map and drive its people into the sea,” Pence said. “America will no longer tolerate Iran’s efforts to destabilize the region and jeopardize Israel’s security,” Pence assured. He told them that “under President Donald Trump, the United States of America will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. This is our solemn promise to you, to Israel, and to the world. History attests that enmity toward the Jewish people often turns from evil thought to evil action.”

The vice president was moved to tears as he related the gripping story of his meeting with a Holocaust survivor during his visit to the first Nazi concentration camp in Dachau, Germany, last month, after attending a security conference there. His tour guide, Abdi Noor, 93, had been imprisoned in Dachau as a 17-year-old boy.

Pence described the hellish torment Noor had experienced as a slave in the Nazi camp. Then, he described the defining moment of his trip.

“Then he stopped, looked up at me with tears in his eyes and said words I’ll never forget. He said, ‘Then the Americans came.’ I was so proud. Those words underscored the imperative of American strength, and they powerfully remind us of the immutable bond between our people and the people of Israel,” Pence said. He added, “Under President Trump’s leadership, America will be strong, stronger than ever before.”

Before Pence took the stage, virtuoso Hagai Shaham played Israel’s national anthem, the “Hatikvah,” on the violin. The Nazis had forced Jews to play violins as they witnessed their fellow Jews march to their deaths in gas chambers. At one point during Shaham’s performance, the crowd lent their voices to the sound of the instrument and sang the words to the song, which means “The Hope.”

Pence finished his speech by telling those gathered, “I know with all of my heart that with your help, with God’s help, and with the strong leadership of President Donald Trump, our nations and our peoples will remain forever friends, and we will go forth together to meet the glorious future that awaits. Thank you. God bless you, God bless Israel, and God bless the United States of America.”

The Times of Israel reports: US President Donald Trump’s Special Envoy for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt met separately in Washington with two senior Israeli politicians: Education Minister Naftali Bennett (Jewish Home) and opposition MK Tzipi Livni.

During a meeting on Sunday, which was said have lasted over an hour, Bennett and Greenblatt discussed the Palestinians, the economy and other regional issues, according to a spokesperson for Bennett.

In a series of Twitter posts, Greenblatt said that the two held “a far ranging and important discussion about US-Israel cooperation and interests,” such as “the importance of working to improve the economic life of Palestinians” and Trump’s “vision for peace and his thoughts on how best to achieve it.” Greenblatt later tweeted that he had hosted Livni, a senior opposition lawmaker in the Zionist Union faction, for Shabbat dinner on Friday night.

The leader of the free-market opposition in Albania told Breitbart News Friday that democracy in his country is in great danger, as the left-wing prime minister Edi Rama has allowed corruption and crime to flourish there.

“Albania is in a unique and difficult situation, in a political crisis, the results of a full onslaught of organized crime on all state structures, on the rule of law, and democracy,” said Lulzim Basha, the leader of the Democratic Party of Albania.

Basha is the former mayor of Tirana, the country’s capital and largest city, and the leader of the Democratic Party of Albania. If the party wins the June 18 parliamentary elections, Basha said he becomes the new prime minister. In previous administrations, Basha held senior cabinet posts, including foreign minister.

“The problem of collusion between politics and crime is not new to the Balkans,” he said. “But, the unique problem for” Albania is the outright promotion and presence of people with terrible criminal records, convicted in European Union states for offenses, such as drug trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking and other organized crime offenses.”

Criminal gangs and groups tied to terrorists operate cannabis farms and drug distribution and warehousing organizations with immunity under the Rama government, he claimed.

In 2016, BBC highlighted the issue in a news report titled “Europe’s outdoor cannabis capital.”

While Basha was in Washington meeting with congressional leaders, members of his party have been carrying on more than 35 days of protests against the government of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama and calling for his resignation.

Among the leaders Basha met during his visit to Washington were Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX), chairman of the House Rules Committee; Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee; and Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee. The Dutch-educated lawyer also attended the National Republican Congressional Committee’s annual dinner Monday, where President Donald Trump delivered the keynote address.

Basha also met with California Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the chairman of its Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats Subcommittee.

A further complication is that Rama has a relationship with financier and international agent provocateur George Soros, the mayor said.

Basha said he believed that Rama is George Soros’ primary investment in Albania and the Balkans.

The mayor claimed that his attacks on Soros personally, and his support for President Donald Trump, have made him the target of Soros organization smears: “I have been viciously attacked by him and his people and also the international media because I am a Trump supporter.”

Rama served at a board member of the Soros Foundation in Albania and Soros funded a two-year project designed to politically transform the country in partnership with Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.

Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee was so concerned about State Department programs funding Soros’ influence in Albania and other countries that he sent a March 14 letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, co-signed by Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), Sen. Tom Tillis (R-NC), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA)

“Over the past few months, elected officials and political leaders of foreign nations have been coming to me with disappointing news and reports of US activity in their respective countries,” Lee wrote. “This includes reports of diplomats playing political favorites, USAID funds supporting extreme and sometimes violent political activists, and the US Government working to marginalize the moderates and conservatives in leadership roles.”

The Albanian prime minister might also be the most adamantly anti-Trump leader in Europe. Basha said that at the request of Soros, Rama went on CNN to say that the prospect of Trump as president was frightening.

In April 2016, Rama told the Voice of America:

I believe that those in Albania who choose Trump before me, despite the differences between them and me, they are to be pitied. Between Lulzim Basha and Trump I will always choose Lulzim Basha, although I would never vote Lulzim Basha under any circumstances and for any reason, for nothing. However, it is not my problem if Lulzim Basha, or whoever else chooses Trump over me. It is their problem

Rohrabacher, who met Basha while in Washington, told Breitbart News he admired the patriotism and zeal he found in Basha.

“There is reason for apprehension about what’s going on in the Balkans,” said the former speechwriter for President Ronald W. Reagan. “Stability in that part of Europe is dependent on a stable and functioning Albania. There is serious concern about the corruption, drug trade and terrorism in this important nation.”

The congressman said Albania is on the front lines in the battle against radical Islam: “If we are going to defeat radical Islam and have a stable Europe, we need someone who can get the job done. Luzlim Basha, whom I have known for some time, is just the person to get that job done.”

Basha said his message to the American people is that they have invested tremendously in to support a democratic, free, and open Albania for the last the past 27 years.

“Now, the menace of organized crime and terrorism looms large over a country that has lost of its territory and borders, because of organized crime,” he said.

“I am pleading for help from the United States to help us preserve that investment, so we can live up to our responsibilities as a NATO member,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b115ec0c0:2d89b46:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, may have violated federal law when he failed to fully disclose details surrounding his membership on the executive board of Joule Unlimited and the “75,000 common shares” he received. The energy company accepted millions from a Vladimir Putin-connected Russian government fund.

Podesta joined the executive board of Joule Unlimited Technologies — a firm partly financed by Putin’s Russia — in June 2011 and received 100,000 shares of stock options, according to an email uncovered by WikiLeaks. Podesta’s membership on the board of directors of Joule Unlimited was first revealed in research from Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer.

Podesta never disclosed his position on Joule Unlimited’s board of directors and failed to include the stock payout in his federal financial disclosures, as required by law, before he became President Obama’s senior adviser in January 2014 — a possible violation for federal law, according to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group (TheDCNF).

“Well Podesta should certainly have been more upfront in filling this out. Clearly, it should have been fully disclosed,” Craig Holman, a lobbyist Public Citizen told TheDCNF. “That’s the point of the personal financial disclosure forms, especially for anyone entering the White House.”

“If the transfer of stock took place, it had to be disclosed,” added former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova in an interview. “If he didn’t, clearly it’s a violation.”

Indeed, Podesta had his Joule shares of stock options transferred to his daughter, Megan Rouse.

“Full transfer request, with Megan’s signature attached,” Podesta’s assistant Eryn Sepp wrote to him on December 31, 2013 — just weeks before Podesta joined the Obama administration.

A January 3, 2014, letter revealed that Podesta designated his daughter’s Dublin, California, residence as the address for Leonidio Holdings LLC, the Delaware-based holding company that Podesta used to transfer his shares in Russian-connected Joule Global Holdings.

Rouse is listed as “managing member” of Leonidio Holdings LLC, according to financial documents.

TheDCNF reports that Podesta was required by law to disclose the aforementioned financial information. His failure to do so may have been illegal:

The Schedule B section of the federal government’s form 278 which — requires financial disclosures for government officials — required Podesta to “report any purchase, sale or exchange by you, your spouse, or dependent children … of any property, stocks, bonds, commodity futures and other securities when the amount of the transaction exceeded $1,000.” Podesta’s form 278 Schedule B is blank regarding his receipt of any stock from any company.

“I think in this case where you’re talking about foreign interests and foreign involvement, the collateral interest with these disclosure forms is put in the forefront of full disclosure of any foreign interest that you may have,” said Ron Hosko, a former FBI assistant director.

“It’s a troubled question if you deliberately omit this information on the form,” Hosko said, adding that Russian funding could have easily “become a counterintelligence concern for America.”

Last week, Rep. Louie Gohmert called for a federal probe into Podesta’s Russian ties.

The new revelations come amid a partisan push to link President Donald Trump and his aides to Russian influence-peddling and collusion during the presidential campaign.

In a new video, a number of Christians living in Iraq expressed their admiration for U.S. President Donald Trump, and their hope that he will make good on promises to assist them and come down hard on the Islamic State.

Asked “What do you think of Donald Trump?” several members of the clergy as well as lay Christians answered that they sensed a positive change after the Obama years, and felt that they were finally being noticed.

Father Immanuel, a Syriac Catholic priest in Mosul, said simply: “I love Trump because he understands this Christian matter in Iraq.”

Archbishop Bashar Warda, the Chaldean Catholic bishop of Erbil, said that he was “really encouraged to see that someone at least is thinking of the Christians and giving, not a priority, but at least attracting attention.”

“For me,” the Archbishop said, “I would say this is probably the first time that an American politician like a president would say, ‘No, there are some people who are dying or are suffering because of their faith and we have to think seriously about that.’”

Though in different words, a common thread running through the responses was the belief that Trump actually cares about persecuted Christians in the Middle East and would do something about it.

Yohanna Toways, a Christian refugee from Qaraqosh, said that Christian and Yezidi minorities had actually prayed to God for Donald Trump to win the election.

“We have confidence in Trump,” Toways said. “Before he was elected, all the Christians and the Yezidi are praying [for him] to win, all of them, and now that he is the president we have the hope he will be the savior of these minorities by his strong decisions. I think he can help us.”

People also said that Trump offered hope to local Christians, after eight years of a president who did nothing for them.

“People here were more than disappointed with Obama, because he did nothing. So the view of Obama was terrible,” said John Neill, a volunteer aid worker for the Archdiocese of Erbil.

“I think people here are feeling excited about Trump, that he will do something,” Neill continued. “He stated in his election speech that he would do something about Daesh. That is an indication that he will go further and help the minorities in Iraq to get back their lives.”

“If Trump cannot give them hope, then what hope is there?” he added.

Similar sentiments were expressed Father Benedict Kiely, the founder of www.nasarean.org, a Christian aid group that has promoted awareness of Christian persecution in ISIS-dominated territory, especially through the spread of the Arabic ن symbol used to mark the homes of Christians.

“Many people said in our interviews with them that they had hope because he is a strong man,” he said. “God bless him. Let’s be strong and help these people. He promised during the election I remember specifically to be the president for the Christians.”

“So let’s put it into action,” he said.

We are witnessing the unraveling of the fabric of constitutional government, and only a fool can believe it will end well.

The nastiest opponents to President Trump inside and out of government apparently feel justified in using “any means necessary” to defeat and remove him. Every day sees more evidence of a desire not only to block his policies but to drive him from office. While it does not yet rise to the level of an organized conspiracy, it does raise serious issues of constitutional fidelity.

First, in the weeks following the November election, we saw street protest and marches, followed by lawsuits, then leaks from inside government, and then talk of “impeachment” over crimes for which no evidence exists.

And folks, in the words of Al Jolson, you ain’t seen nothing yet. It’s probably going to get worse.

The seeds of this “cultural embarrassment” over Trump’s victory were planted in the days immediately following the November 8 election:

First, there was the nonsensical insistence that his victory was illegitimate because he won only the Electoral College majority and not a popular vote majority. Unfortunately, the Constitution is silent on the popular mandate theory.

When that didn’t take hold, the opponents drummed up a claim the election was “stolen” from Hillary Clinton by Trump campaign collusion with “the Russians.” That became a constant media drumbeat for weeks and continues today.

Then as the icing on this half-baked cake came the orchestrated resistance to Trump’s immigration executive orders through desperate challenges in federal courts brought before Obama-appointed judges.

These efforts have at least three obvious things in common: desperation born of utter shock at Trump’s election victory; self-righteous elitist arrogance; and the active participation and support from the nation’s major media organizations.

Yet, there is another novel element interwoven in these events that is even more dangerous – dangerous not simply as a political obstacle to Trump’s agenda, but inherently dangerous to the survival of our country.

That novel element is the active, conscious subversion of lawful Presidential orders and initiatives by the permanent civil service apparatus called the “senior bureaucracy.” It is also being called the “Deep State,” meaning the part of the government that is immune to political appointment and political accountability.

And most dangerous of all is the involvement of our nation’s intelligence agencies in the leaks aimed at embarrassing the President. The earliest news stories about an alleged “Russian connection” openly named America’s intelligence operations as the source.

Now comes this month’s FBI testimony that the agency has been conducting an investigation of the Trump campaign, and yet the FBI still has not cited any evidence of any law-breaking that justifies the investigation.

This involvement of intelligence agencies and the FBI in politically-inspired investigations – and the subsequent leaking of information gathered in the surveillance– puts into question the President’s ability to trust the information provided to him by those agencies. And THAT, my friends, can seriously impair his ability to manage national security policy and any international or terrorism-related crisis that occurs.

The theme of an “illegitimate presidency” provides a veneer of moral justification for seemingly disconnected acts of political sabotage. If resistance to Trump’s policies is resistance to “tyranny” by a “usurper,” then nothing is out of bounds or off limits.

This “supra-legal” arrogance is what makes the anti-Trump campaign potentially lethal for constitutional government. The effort to paint President Trump as a usurper who deserves to be thrown out of office is unprecedented in its scope and intensity, and it will have unintended consequences for the Republic.

This week there were revelations from the House Intelligence Committee supporting Trump’s allegation of Obama regime surveillance of the Trump campaign and transition. Intelligence gathered by lawful wiretaps of foreign agent activities recorded “incidental” conversations involving persons inside or close to Trump campaign. Those “intercepted” conversations reportedly had nothing to do with alleged “Russian hacking” of the election, nor did they reveal any “collusion” with Russian agents. Yet, contrary to law, the conversations were shared with Obama White House staff and then with the media.

How do we explain the bizarre obsession of Democrat leaders and the media with the “Russian connection”? Not one tiny shred of evidence has been produced by anyone to show any Trump campaign collusion with Russian activities connected to the 2016 election. And yet, the media and Democrat opponents (sorry, I repeat myself) continue to raise that specter to keep alive the myth of a “stolen election.”

In the last days of the Obama administration, new rules were signed into law by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the NSA Director as administrative amendments to Executive Order 12333, rules allowing the distribution of certain raw intelligence data to 16 additional government agencies at home and abroad. It may have been those new rules which facilitated the leaking of information concerning conversations Trump’s nominee for NSC-director, Mike Flynn, had with the Russian Ambassador—conversations which the FBI later said broke no laws.

What this week’s revelations show is not any Russian collusion with Trump to influence the election but nearly the exact opposite: elements of the Obama government colluded with intelligence agencies to spy on the Trump campaign—or at a minimum, to use information gathered by surveillance to attack and undermine the Trump campaign team’s transition plans for an orderly changing of the guard.

Opposition to Trump policies is to be expected, and foot-dragging by hostile bureaucrats was not unknown in the first year of the Reagan administration and other governmental changeovers. But there are legitimate and lawful means of opposition and illegitimate ones—even illegal ones, like the leaking of classified information. If the anti-Trump saboteurs inside government expect the American public and tens of millions of Trump supporters to tolerate organized, incipient treason against constitutional government, they are mistaken.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b10820a3f:2c25296:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A bill to curtail the number of Americans being replaced by foreign guest workers through the H-1B visa “would have zero impact” on the program, according to an expert on the issue.

Reps. Derek Kilmer (D-WA) and Doug Collins (R-IL) have reintroduced the “Keeping American Jobs Act”, which they claim will tackle abuses of the H-1B foreign guest worker visa.

“The Keeping American Jobs Act protects American workers by preventing bad actors from abusing the system in order to offshore jobs,” Collins told Live Mint.

“Companies have the opportunity to bring workers from overseas on H-1B visas in the event that qualified Americans aren’t available, but we can’t allow the law to be exploited to displace American workers and send their jobs abroad,” Collins continued.

But, NumbersUSA’s Director of Government Relations Rosemary Jenks said the congressmen are “misunderstanding” what the H-1B visa program actually does, as far as Americans being replaced by cheaper, foreign workers.

“This doesn’t have any impact on outsourcing jobs,” Jenks told Breitbart Texas. “H-1B’s are coming here. This shows a misunderstanding of the entire H-1B program. H-1B has nothing to do with moving jobs abroad.”

Some 85,000 foreign workers are allotted jobs in the U.S. every year under the H-1B visa program, often leaving Americans to train their replacements.

Jenks told Breitbart Texas that this H-1B bill is not actually reform at all, and instead is “just another case of Members of Congress being sadly confused.”

“This is pathetic,” Jenks said. They need to actually understand what the H-1B program is. This would have zero impact.”

The bill states that it would “prevent the transfer of knowledge from United States workers for the purpose of facilitating their jobs being moved abroad.”

Nonetheless, while U.S. jobs have been shipped overseas in order for companies to pay less for workers, that issue is entirely unrelated to the abuses of the H-1B visa.

The H-1B visa remains incredibly unpopular with American voters. As Breitbart Texas reported, only 30 percent of Americans say companies bringing in foreign workers to fill jobs is necessary.

Additionally, some 44 percent said those foreign workers take jobs away. The vast majority of Americans also said the number of H-1B visas allotted every year to companies should either be decreased or kept at the current levels.

The use of the H-1B visa was panned by President Donald Trump on the campaign trail last year, often holding rallies with fired Disney and tech industry employees who were forced to train their replacements.

However, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said the H-1B abuses are not a reform priority for the Trump Administration this year, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Both federal judges who issued separate decisions on March 15 revoking President Trump’s travel ban cited a draft Department Homeland Security document leaked to the Associated Press by an unknown person and included in a story published on February 24 as evidence central to their rulings.

The significance of the unofficial leaked draft DHS document upon which these two federal judges relied in making their controversial travel ban decisions is the false information it conveys about the level of risk posed to national security by refugees who commit terrorist acts.

The leaked draft DHS document also makes no mention at all of the significant public health risk, particularly from tuberculosis posed by refugees, a topic on which Breitbart News has reported extensively.

Neither Judge Chuang nor Judge Watson noted that two Somali refugees, Dahir Adan in St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Abul Razak Ali Artan in Columbus, Ohio, committed acts of terror during a two month period in 2016, the first in September 2016 and the second in November 2016, that injured a total of 21 Americans.

The data included in the leaked draft document “is dramatically different than the data reported in another list of terrorists compiled by former Senator, now Attorney General, Jeff Sessions,” Breitbart News reported last month.

According to a document published by the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, “DOJ Public/Unsealed Terrorism and Terrorism-Related Convictions 9/11/01-12/31/14,” 74 people from the seven countries identified in the temporary travel ban in Executive Order 13679–Iran (3), Iraq (19), Libya (1), Somalia (21), Syria (7), Sudan (3), and Yemen (20)–were arrested and convicted of terrorist acts between 2001 and 2014.

The Senate document identified 580 terrorists arrested and convicted, 375 of whom were foreign-born whose country of origin was also included in the report.

In other words, of the known acts of terrorism during this 13- year period, more than 19 percent (74 out of 375) were perpetrated by citizens of the seven countries subject to the temporary travel ban in Executive Order 13769. Those same seven countries accounted for less than one percent of the immigrant visas granted to residents of foreign countries during those 13 years.

A second document, titled “Individuals Implicated in Terrorism Since March 2014,” was also published by that same subcommittee.

“[Senator] Cruz and [Senator] Sessions’ office have so far identified at least 131 additional individuals [identified in that document] who have been implicated in terrorism since early 2014 — these haven’t been convicted and are newer cases. At least 54 of these individuals are foreign-born and 16 of them were initially admitted to the United States as refugees. At least another 17 are the natural-born citizen children of immigrants,” the Daily Caller reported.

Judge Chuang and Judge Watson issued temporary restraining orders halting the implementation of much of President Trump’s second travel ban, Executive Order 13780, which temporarily banned travel from six nations also temporarily banned in Executive Order 13769–Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen–but removed the seventh nation temporarily banned in the first travel ban, Executive Order 13769–Iraq.

Neither Judge Chuang nor Judge Watson mentioned these two Senate reports – “DOJ Public/Unsealed Terrorism and Terrorism-Related Convictions 9/11/01-12/31/14,” and “Individuals Implicated in Terrorism Since March 2014,” in their decisions.

Instead, they relied upon the draft DHS document leaked to the Associated Press and published in the February 24 Associated Press article.

“Plaintiffs argue that the stated national security rationale is limited and flawed,” Judge Theodore Chuang of the U.S. District Court in Maryland wrote on page 34 of his March 15 decision,

Among other points, they note that the Second Executive Order does not identify examples of foreign nationals from Iran, Libya, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen who engaged in terrorist activity in the United States. They also note that a report from the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, concluded that “country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity” and that “few of the impacted countries have terrorist groups that threaten the West.” l.R. 158. Furthermore, they note that the 300 FBI investigations are dwarfed by the over 11,000 counterterrorism investigations at anyone time, only a fraction of which lead to actual evidence of illegal activity (emphasis added)

“In addition to these accounts, Plaintiffs describe a draft report from the DHS, which they contend undermines the purported national security rationale for the Executive Order,” Judge Derrick Watson of the U.S. District Court in Hawaii wrote on page 13 of his March 15 decision (emphasis added):

The February 24, 2017 draft report states that citizenship is an “unlikely indicator” of terrorism threats against the United States and that very few individuals from the seven countries included in Executive Order No. 13,769 had carried out or attempted to carry out terrorism activities in the United States. SAC ¶ 61 (citing SAC, Ex. 10, ECF No. 64-10). According to Plaintiffs, this and other evidence demonstrates the Administration’s pretextual justification for the Executive Order. (emphasis added)

Judge Chuang, who made a factual error in the very first sentence of his March 15 decision, as Breitbart News reported, makes another factual error in his description of the document as “a report from the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Intelligence and Analysis.” Judge Watson accurately describes it as a “draft report,” but inaccurately describes it as a “February 24, 2017 draft report.” (emphasis added).

The draft document, or “report” that someone had obtained from DHS and leaked to article authors Alice A. Caldwell and Vivian Salama was published on February 24 in an “Exclusive” Associated Press story. The leaked draft document was actually prepared some time prior to February 24.

As Breitbart News reported previously, several legal scholars have questioned Chuang’s impartiality in the case, since he served as deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security from 2009 to 2014 in the Obama administration, where he defended policies diametrically opposed to President Trump. DHS is a defendant in the suit.

A timeline of the mysterious events surrounding the leaking of this draft DHS document that played such an influential role in the March 15 decisions of Judge Chuang and Judge Watson raises a number of questions about the document’s provenance:

“Analysts at the Homeland Security Department’s intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries included in President Donald Trump’s travel ban pose a terror threat to the United States,” Salama and Caldwell reported in their February 24 AP story.

But DHS spokesperson Gillan Christensen told both AP and Breitbart News the leaked document was in no way a final approved DHS work product.

“While DHS was asked to draft a comprehensive report on this issue, the document you’re referencing was commentary from a single intelligence source versus an official, robust document with thorough interagency sourcing . . . The report does not include data from other intelligence community sources. It is incomplete,” Homeland Security spokesperson Gillian Christensen told Salama and Caldwell.

Significant in Christensen’s comment was her use of the term “a single intelligence source” to describe the author of the leaked document.

In their February 24 AP story, Salama and Caldwell used the plural “analysts” to describe the authorship of the leaked document.

“The [leaked draft] report was incomplete and had not been subject to the extensive interagency review process required of finished intelligence products,” Christensen told Breitbart News on February 26.

The most significant aspect of the content of the leaked DHS document is the data its author consciously chose to exclude.

“DHS I &amp; A [Intelligence and Analysis] assesses that country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity,” the three page unsigned document with no letterhead states in a section titled “Citizens of Countries Affected by E.O. 13769 Rarely Implicated in US-Based Terrorism”:

Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict in March 2011, at least 82 primarily US-based individuals, who died in pursuit of or were convicted of any terrorism-related federal offense inspired by a foreign terrorist organization, according to a DHS study of Department of Justice press releases on convictions of terrorist attack perpetrators killed in the act.

In an end note, the leaked draft document references “DHS I&amp;A Terrorism-Related Activities Study; 16 FEB 17; DOI 01 MAR 11 – 31 JAN 17.”

A footnote makes it clear that the report intentionally excluded at least a dozen Somalis who were arrested after attempting to leave America to fight for ISIS: “For the purposes of this paper, we limited our data to individuals prosecuted under 8 USC Chapter 133B in support of or inspired by a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). We excluded traveling or attempting to travel overseas to join a FTO and activities unrelated to FTOs, to include purely domestic terrorism.”

Given the obvious flaws in the draft document, it is unclear why both Judge Chuang and Judge Watson chose to rely upon it so heavily in their decisions.

It is also unclear who leaked the draft document from DHS, why these unknown persons leaked the draft document, how it came in to the possession of AP reporters Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell, if any laws were violated by the leak, and whether or not there is a current investigation at DHS or within the Trump administration to determine the identity of the document leaker.

The original leaker was almost certainly a bureaucrat at the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis who either prepared the draft document or had access to the draft document.

Beyond that, there is no solid evidence as to the identity of the leaker.

There are, however, some curious connections between current and former officials in that office and the Democratic establishment and the press, in particular Associated Press.

John Cohen, the former Acting Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, is a known source of Vivian Salama, the AP reporter who co-authored the report that published the leaked document. (See January 27 article).

And, as Breitbart News has reported previously David Grannis, the Obama holdover bureaucrat who has served as Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security since 2015, the office in DHS where the draft document purportedly was created, is one of eight Obama holdovers at DHS who President Trump can “fire or remove.”

“As a civil servant, Grannis cannot be fired from his job,” Breitbart News reported.

Grannis’ background is of a highly political Democrat:

A lifelong Democrat, “[p]rior to joining DHS, Mr. Grannis served as the Staff Director of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) from 2009 through 2014 and as the Minority Staff Director for 2015. During this time, he served as the principal intelligence advisor to SSCI Chairman Dianne Feinstein and SSCI Members and led the Committee’s efforts to produce and enact annual Intelligence Authorization Act from 2010 through 2016 and the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, according to the DHS website. He has spent his career working for partisan Democratic members of Congress: He previously served as a staff designee to Senator Feinstein on the SSCI from 2005 until 2009 with a varied portfolio of committee responsibilities. Mr. Grannis worked on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security with responsibilities for intelligence, aviation security, and science and technology from 2003 to 2005 and was Senior Policy Advisor to Representative Jane Harman on matters of national security from 2001 to 2003.

“A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security would neither confirm nor deny that Grannis was the author of, or had reviewed, the leaked draft document, though it did appear to be authored by someone associated with his area of responsibility within DHS,” Breitbart News reported on February 26.

How AP reporters Vivian Salama and Alice C. Caldwell came into possession of the leaked draft DHS document which they published in their Exclusive February 24 AP story is another unsolved mystery.

One thing that is no mystery is Salama’s sympathy for residents of Yemen.

Yemen, one of the seven Middle Eastern countries affected by the temporary travel ban in President Trump’s January 27 Executive Order 13769, and one of the six Middle Eastern countries affected by the travel ban in President Trump’s revised March 6 Executive Order 13780, “holds a special place in my heart,” Salama wrote in 2014.

“Anyone who knows me, knows Yemen holds a special place in my heart. Its diverse landscape is breathtaking and its rich history is virtually untouched after centuries. But what I love most about Yemen is, hands down, its people (its food comes in a distant second!) They smile from inside, even though they face a great deal of adversity, militants roam freely by land and foreign drones hover above them. This report, from my latest visit to Yemen, explores that latter phenomenon — U.S. drones — and argues that the their existence alone is causing profound psychological detriment to a nation,” Salama wrote on her blog in April 2014.

She linked to the Rolling Stone article she wrote on that same day, “Death From Above: How American Drone Strikes Are Devastating Yemen”:

The people of Yemen can hear destruction before it arrives. In cities, towns and villages across this country, which hangs off the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula, the air buzzes with the sound of American drones flying overhead. The sound is a constant and terrible reminder: a robot plane, acting on secret intelligence, may calculate that the man across from you at the coffee shop, or the acquaintance with whom you’ve shared a passing word on the street, is an Al Qaeda operative. This intelligence may be accurate or it may not, but it doesn’t matter. If you are in the wrong place at the wrong time, the chaotic buzzing above sharpens into the death-herald of an incoming missile. New Report Documents the Human Cost of U.S. Drone Strikes in Yemen Such quite literal existential uncertainty is coming at a deep psychological cost for the Yemeni people. For Americans, this military campaign is an abstraction. The drone strikes don’t require U.S. troops on the ground, and thus are easy to keep out of sight and out of mind. Over half of Yemen’s 24.8 million citizens – militants and civilians alike – are impacted every day. A war is happening, and one of the unforeseen casualties is the Yemeni mind. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, trauma and anxiety are becoming rampant in the different corners of the country where drones are active. “Drones hover over an area for hours, sometimes days and weeks,” said Rooj Alwazir, a Yemeni-American anti-drone activist and cofounder of Support Yemen, a media collective raising awareness about issues afflicting the country. Yemenis widely describe suffering from constant sleeplessness, anxiety, short-tempers, an inability to concentrate and, unsurprisingly, paranoia.

After leaving Rolling Stone, Salama became AP’s correspondent on Baghdad, Iraq, and went on to become AP’s deputy political editor, and now serves as AP’s White House correspondent.

“I’m very pleased to let you know that Vivian Salama, AP’s current Baghdad bureau chief, will join us in early December as deputy political editor,” AP director of media relations Laura Easton announced in October 2015:

Vivian is from New City, New York. She is a graduate of Rutgers University in New Jersey and holds a master’s degree in Middle East and Islamic Studies from Columbia University. After moving to the Middle East, she was a freelancer for AP Television from 2004 to 2006. She went on to report in Pakistan, and then opened the Bloomberg bureau in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Vivian also has appeared as a commentator on BBC and NPR, among others, and has contributed to Newsweek, the Daily Beast, Rolling Stone and the Atlantic.

According to her Linked In account, Salama is currently enrolled at Georgetown University Law School, in addition to her duties covering the White House in national security and foreign affairs for AP.

The International Refugee Assistance Project, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit in which Judge Chuang ruled on March 15 to revoke President Trump’s Executive Order 13780 which contained the travel ban for citizens of Yemen and five other Middle Eastern countries, has a chapter at Georgetown University Law Center, as well as about thirty other law schools around the country.

Judge Chuang is expected to rule on a plaintiffs request set forward in the original complaint to more than double the number of refugees to enter the United States on Tuesday.

The Department of Justice is appealing Judge Chuang’s March 15 ruling revoking the travel ban to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b10820a3f:2c25293:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

SINGAPORE (AFP) – French President Francois Hollande said Monday the final mission of his term would be to ensure that “populism, nationalism and extremism cannot win” in the world and especially not in France.

Hollande’s term of office ends in mid-May and far-right politician Marine Le Pen is seen as one of the leading candidates to replace him.

In addition, Britain has voted to leave the European Union and the United States has elected populist President Donald Trump.

“I still have (work) to do to prevent populism, nationalism and extremism from prevailing, including in my own country,” Hollande told the prestigious Singapore Conference.

He began the last major international tour of his term in office in the city-state on Sunday and will go on to Malaysia and Indonesia.

Hollande said the mission to reject populism was not just one for a president. Citizens and officials also had a responsibility to speak out.

“And as far as I am concerned, I will continue to speak as much as I can and to ensure that what I have done as president can have consequences,” he said without elaborating.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b102f4661:2b995c5:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” while discussing President Donald Trump tweeting that everyone should watch Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” during which host Jeanine Pirro called on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) to step down as speaker, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus called it “coincidental” and said Trump did not want Ryan to step down.

Partial transport as follows:

WALLACE: Wallace: Does the president want Paul Ryan to resign as Speaker?”

PRIEBUS: First of all, I will go on record, we do love Judge Jeanine, and so does the president. I think it was more coincidental.

WALLACE: Come on.

PRIEBUS: I did not talk to the president about the tweet. I’m just telling the truth. There is no preplanning here.

PRIEBUS: He loves Judge Jeanine and he wants to do Judge Jeanine a favor.

WALLACE: Does he want Paul Ryan to step down?

PRIEBUS: No he doesn’t. he believes what he said in the Oval Office on Friday. He doesn’t blame Paul Ryan. He thought Paul Ryan worked really hard, enjoys his relationship with Paul Ryan, thinks that Paul Ryan is a great Speaker of the House. None of that has changed. This is more of a personal relationship, the president helping out a friend.

British cultural icon and punk rock godfather John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) has hailed the “joy” of populist, anti-establishment movements across the West.

Mr Lydon backed Brexit, claimed President Donald J. Trump was unfairly smeared by the “left wing” media, and said he wanted to shake “fantastic” Nigel Farage’s hand for taking on elites.

Speaking on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, the Sex Pistols frontman praised how the former UKIP leader led a flotilla of pro-Brexit fishermen in the so-called “Battle of the Thames” – when they faced off with a group of pro-EU millionaires and celebrities.

“After that up-the-River-Thames argument he had with Bob Geldof, I wanted to shake [Nigel Farage’s] hand because it was silly beyond belief.

“Where do I stand on Brexit? Well, here it goes: the working class have spoke, and I’m one of them, and I’m with them,” he said.

The punk icon also said the unconventional outsider President Trump was a type of punk rock politician who was being unfairly attacked by the media establishment.

He dubbed Mr. Trump “a complicated fellow”, adding: “As one journalist once said to me, is he the political Sex Pistol? In a way.

“What I dislike is the left wing media in America are trying to smear the bloke as a racist, and that’s completely not true.

“There are many, many problems with him as a human being but he’s not that, and there just might be a chance something good will come out of this situation because it terrifies politicians. This is a joy to behold for me.”

When host Piers Morgan described Mr. Trump as “the archetypal anti-establishment figure”, Mr. Lydon said: “Dare I say, a possible friend.”

The former Sex Pistols singer is famous for singing the 1977 anti-establishment hit ‘God Save the Queen’, which brands the royal family a “fascist regime”.

However as he has grown older, his views have mellowed somewhat. Lydon recently revealed he is in fact quite fond of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

Speaking to the music website The Quietus last week, he said: “I will sorely miss her as a human being on planet Earth. It is not her fault she was born into a gilded cage. I don’t know about the ‘reign’ part, but long may she live.”

He also clarified the song was “about a political situation and the demand for obedience to a monarchy I don’t believe in”.

Mr. Lydon also revealed that he appreciates tradition and royal events, and said he “loved the pageantry” of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding in 2011.

“Oh, when the planes flew over the palace? It reminded me of World War Two and all those films, and how grim it was fighting Nazis. For me, it was a reintroduction to history, lest we forget,” he added.

The punk rocker has supported Brexit for some time, and last year said he was glad the “working classes had risen up against the Tories” and were “taking back the country” with the vote to leave the European Union.

In 2013, he also defended former Prime Minister Margret Thatcher, saying he thought those celebrating her death were “loathsome”.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0fc0efdd:2b1f4f8:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

TEL AVIV – Over the past week, numerous Democratic Party operatives and establishment pundits have used the word “treason” in a seeming attempt to smear President Donald Trump over unproven claims of collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.

On Monday, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager, Robby Mook, demanded Trump’s campaign aides be “prosecuted for treason” if evidence emerges of coordination with Moscow during the recent presidential campaign.

One day later, on Tuesday, Michael Winship, senior writer for BillMoyers.com, wrote an opinion piece titled, “‘There’s a Smell of Treason in the Air’” Winship is a former senior writing fellow at the progressive advocacy group Demos, which is financed by billionaire George Soros.

Winship’s piece, which was republished at the Huffington Post, argued that last Monday’s House Intelligence Committee hearing that probed alleged ties between the Trump administration and Russia was “proof positive of the absolute need for both a special prosecutor and an independent, bipartisan commission with subpoena power to conduct a full investigation” on the matter.

Last week, this reporter found serious problems with the main anti-Trump charges at the hearing, delivered in opening remarks by Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on a House intelligence committee. The charges included wild conspiracy theories and heavy reliance on a questionable source.

The title of Winship’s article, meanwhile, comes from a quote in the Washington Post last week provided by presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who told the newspaper, “There’s a smell of treason in the air. Imagine if J. Edgar Hoover or any other FBI director would have testified against a sitting president? It would have been a mindboggling event.”

Winship went on to compare the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to the Watergate scandal under the Nixon administration:

During Schiff’s questioning on Monday, Comey seemed to nod toward agreeing that Russia’s hacking of the Democratic National Committee was not unlike the 1972 physical break-in at the DNC. You know, the one that precipitated the revelations, resignations and prison convictions of Watergate. Drip, drip, drip…

On Thursday, Nicholas Kristof wrote an oped in the New York Times using the same title as Winship, also citing Brinkley’s quotes to the Washington Post.

Kristof starts off his piece, titled, “‘There’s a Smell of Treason in the Air,’” by citing President Richard Nixon:

The greatest political scandal in American history was not Aaron Burr’s shooting of Alexander Hamilton, and perhaps wasn’t even Watergate. Rather it may have been Richard Nixon’s secret efforts in 1968 to sabotage a U.S. diplomatic effort to end the Vietnam War.

Nixon’s initiative, long rumored but confirmed only a few months ago, was meant to improve his election chances that year. After Nixon won, the war dragged on and cost thousands of additional American and Vietnamese lives; it’s hard to see his behavior as anything but treason.

Like Winship, Kristof tries to link Trump to Nixon in order to make the “treason” argument. “Now the F.B.I. confirms that we have had an investigation underway for eight months into whether another presidential campaign colluded with a foreign power so as to win an election,” Kristof wrote. “To me, that too would amount to treason.”

Kristof relied on his own “intelligence experts” who “mostly (but not entirely) believe” that there is a Trump-Russia connection.

He wrote:

I’ve been speaking to intelligence experts, Americans and foreigners alike, and they mostly (but not entirely) believe there was Trump-Russia cooperation of some kind. But this is uncertain; it’s prudent to note that James Clapper, the intelligence director under Barack Obama, said that as of January he had seen no evidence of collusion but that he favors an investigation to get to the bottom of it.

Kristof claimed he was “told (not by a Democrat!) that there’s a persuasive piece of intelligence on ties between Russia and a member of the Trump team that isn’t yet public.”

Kristof speculated the “most likely scenario for collusion seems fuzzier and less transactional than many Democrats anticipate.”

Despite there being no evidence of significant Trump investments in Russia, Kristof then guesses at what it might be – alleged Trump investments in Russia:

The Russians for years had influence over Donald Trump because of their investments with him, and he was by nature inclined to admire Vladimir Putin as a strongman ruler. Meanwhile, Trump had in his orbit a number of people with Moscow ties, including Paul Manafort, who practically bleeds borscht.

The Times’ columnist goes on to channel Winship and also demand the same talking point – a “public and bipartisan investigation by an independent commission.”

On cue, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) warned Friday of a “cloud of treason” hanging over the Trump administration. “The bombshell revelation that US officials have information that suggests Trump associates may have colluded with the Russians means we must pause the entire Trump agenda,” he said.

Lieu called for the “total and complete” shutdown of Trump’s legislative agenda in the wake of the claims.

“We may have an illegitimate President of the United States currently occupying the White House,” Lieu said in a statement. “Congress cannot continue regular order and must stop voting on any Trump-backed agenda item until the FBI completes its Trump-Russia collusion investigation.”

Lieu made similar “treason” comments on Twitter.

Cloud of treason means we must have total shutdown of any @POTUS agenda item. No votes on any item. My stmt https://t.co/stvzhHfMZ6 #GetWoke — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 23, 2017

Last week, Lieu also tweeted to Trump: “You truly are an evil man…”

&quot;President&quot; @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. https://t.co/2M94E1g39b — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017

Writing in the Washington Post on Friday, Jennifer Palmieri, Director of Communications for Clinton’s presidential campaign, also referenced “treason” but from a different angle.

“If Clinton had won with the help of the Russians, the Republicans would have impeachment proceedings underway for treason,” she contended. “No doubt. Instead, dealing with Russia falls nearly solely on Democrats’ shoulders.”

To Palmieri, the case is already closed. She writes that Trump won because of a Russian “plot” as if it were an established fact.

“Now that Trump is president, though, the stakes are higher because the Russian plot succeeded,” Palmieri claims.

Like Winship and Kristof, Palmieri references Watergate to make her point: “The possibility of collusion between Trump’s allies and Russian intelligence is much more serious than Watergate. It is a constitutional crisis. It represents a violation of our republic’s most sacred trust.”

Writing in The Week on Friday, senior correspondent Damon Linker also claims Trump could be guilty of “treason.”

Here is what I can’t understand: FBI Director James Comey testified on Monday that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is under investigation by the FBI over its potential ties to Russia. Let’s be clear about what this might mean: treason.

We don’t yet know what the outcome of the investigation will be (though subsequent press reports have certainly underlined the importance of seeing it through to the end). But the very possibility that a sitting president and his circle could end up credibly accused of having advanced the interests of a hostile foreign power and of having colluded with that power in an effort to undermine the campaign of the president’s political opponent should be more than enough to persuade Republican officeholders and pundits to treat the investigation with utmost seriousness — and to distance themselves from the man at the center of the investigation until such time as he is cleared of any wrongdoing.

And like the others, Linker likens the Russia claims to “Watergate” to advance the “treason” narrative.

Finally, there’s the relative gravity of the allegations in the two scandals. The Watergate break-in itself was obviously a crime, but what led to Nixon’s downfall was the cover-up, which implicated the president in multiple acts of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. That would have been more than enough to impeach Nixon, remove him from office, and indict him. Bad? You bet. But far from treason.

The allegations swirling around the Trump campaign are far more serious.

Also on Friday, journalist Carl Bernstein – who is known for breaking the Watergate story in 1972 – slammed Trump as “more treacherous” than Nixon.

Meanwhile, former Bill Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who has been working closely with the Soros-financed MoveOn.org, penned a piece published in Newsweek arguing Trump’s Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch “shouldn’t be confirmed until Trump comes clean” about alleged ties to Russia.

Like Lieu’s reference to a “cloud of treason” hanging over the Trump administration, Reich claimed a “true cloud of illegitimacy now hangs over the presidency of Donald Trump.”

Reich’s piece was followed up by a MoveOn.org petition calling for Trump’s agenda to be “shut down” while he is investigated over the Russia claims.

The petition states: “Congress must pause all Trump-related legislation and appointments—starting with a halt to Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation process—until the American people learn the full truth about Trump and Russia.”

In recent days, the hashtag #TrumpTreason has been trending on Twitter.

Prominent users of the hashtag include Trump critic Rosie O’Donnell

how about – SCOTUS APPOINTMENTS SUSPENDED – TIL THE INVESTIGATION IS OVER – #TRUMPTREASON https://t.co/RfKR4nJzpR — ROSIE (@Rosie) March 20, 2017

This is not the first time this reporter documented the theme of establishment-types parroting similar anti-Trump talking points. In February, a trend emerged in which news media outlets featured articles quoting health care professionals who questioned the billionaire’s mental stability in a seeming bid to delegitimize the president.

Following those reports, some Democratic politicians – and at least one Republican – called for Trump to be subjected to a psychiatric examination to determine whether he was fit for office. Some commentators have even suggested invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution, which allows for the commander-in-chief’s removal from office if the “president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”

The Times of Israel reports: Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on Sunday discussed US-Egypt relations, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and his upcoming trip to the White House with World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder.

Sissi is slated to visit the White House to meet US President Donald Trump during the first week of April, and the peace process is expected to be one of the items on the agenda.

“The next stage requires strengthening… of Egyptian-American relations at all levels,” Sissi told Lauder, describing the current relations between Washington and Cairo as “close, extensive and of a strategic nature,” according to an Egyptian readout of the meeting published by the Turkish Anadolu agency. The meeting between Sissi and Lauder took place in the presidential palace in eastern Cairo, and was attended by the head of Egyptian intelligence, Khaled Fawzi.

During his monologue on Saturday’s “The Greg Gutfeld Show,” host Greg Gutfeld reacted to President Donald Trump’s accusation that former President Barack Obama wiretapped him and the fallout following the claim.

“Maybe Trump wasn’t totally wrong after all. Maybe he was just half wrong, which makes him half right– which among politicians makes him a genius,” Gutfeld stated.

“This doesn’t vindicate Trump, but it does not not vindicate him,” he added. “He may have been wrong specifically but generally speaking, what happened is enough smoke to maybe look like fire. For Trump, that’s a win. It’s funny, even when he’s losing he ends up winning because the nuttiness of his enemies makes him right by comparison.”

President Donald Trump’s recent defense of Israel at the United Nations is almost unprecedented, and warrants the appreciation and gratitude of the American Jewish and pro-Israel community.

His defense of Israel at the amoral body so early in his administration has been particularly impressive, given President Barack Obama’s parting shot at Israel with Security Council Resolution 2334.

Even before taking office, Trump was using his future influence to protect Israel. Last December — as genocide raged in Aleppo — President Obama decided to use his last weeks in office not to protect Arab children being murdered with mustard gas but to assail the Jewish state at the UN, breaking America’s long-standing tradition of using its veto power to protect Israel from unfair attacks in the Security Council.

Obama eventually succeeded in helping to pass an anti-Israel resolution, but only after Trump lobbied Egypt into dropping the bid, forcing Obama to turn to other countries to introduce the resolution. Trump then used his Twitter feed as a weapon in defense of the Jewish state. “Stay Strong Israel,” he tweeted, “January 20th is fast approaching!”

Since assuming office, Trump has, along with his tough-as-nails UN Ambassador Nicky Haley, completely reversed the decline of American support for Israel at the UN.

Last month, Haley joined other Trump forces in Washington in blocking UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres from selecting Salam Fayyad, a former Palestinian prime minister, to run the UN mission in Libya. She remarked that “for too long the UN has been unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel,” adding that the US “does not currently recognize a Palestinian state or support the signal this appointment would send within the United Nations.”

Just last week, the Trump administration solidified its stance on Israel by pressuring the UN into dismissing a report by rabid Israel-hater Rima Khalef, chairman of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UNESCWA). The report, drafted at the request of eighteen Arab countries, depicted Israel as “an apartheid regime that dominates the Palestinian people as a whole” and went on to claim that Israel was “designed” for this purpose. Khalef, who refused to repudiate her Israel-bashing report, has since resigned. Ambassador Haley’s response: “When someone issues a false and defamatory report in the name of the UN, it is appropriate that the person resign.”

In an op-ed for CNN, Richard Roth summed it up perfectly: “Memo to critics of Israel inside the UN system: Prepare to pay a price.”

Showing gratitude is a central Jewish value. This would be a good time for our community to remember that.

Every year, I attend the remarkable AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, D.C. It’s an incredible spectacle. Close to 20,000 people mill about the massive Washington Convention Center, socializing, networking, and educating themselves in the myriad panels and lectures offered at the mega-event.

There’s even a fully kosher village dining hall that feels roughly the size of an international airport runway. The plenaries rank as some of the largest Jewish events on earth. But what people really come for is the incredible lineup of speakers, which features stars from all across the political spectrum — whether in Congress, global leaders, and most importantly, the Presidential Administration.

This year, though, things might be slightly less incredible.

AIPAC will head into its main event without the participation of the man who lit up the conference last year with one of its best speeches, Donald Trump, who has since gone on to become President of the United States. Vice-President Mike Pence, a long and stalwart friend of Israel, will be representing the president at AIPAC — and will, no doubt, deliver a strong speech.

Twelve months ago, candidate Trump was invited to speak at Policy Conference. And speak he did. Trump delivered a compelling, eloquent, and comprehensive speech on the state of American relations with Israel and how he wouldd work to improve them. At a certain point, the candidate swerved off the planned text and said of Obama’s last months in office: “With President Obama in his final year. Yay!”

The comment earned mass applause.

He later referred to Obama as “maybe the worst thing to happen to Israel.”

The audience, many of whom were growing weary of Obama’s undisguised animus to Israel’s elected leader Benjamin Netanyahu, another conference participant, rose in huge applause.

I was there. Trump electrified the massive arena.

The very next day, AIPAC President Lillian Pinkus introduced Bibi Netanyahu’s televised address with an emotional display at Trump’s comments. Choking back tears, she spoke of how despite her having “preached a message of unity … last evening, something occurred which has the potential to drive us apart, to divide us.” She went on to say that AIPAC’s leadership took “great offense” at the “ad hominem attacks … levied against the President of the United States of America from our stage.”

Pinkus went on to say how “deeply sorry” she was for those “members of the AIPAC family” who had been “deeply hurt.” And, with regard to the applause from the audience, Pinkus said she was “disappointed.”

Pinkus’s response was uneven and questionable. Moments after Trump spoke, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) compared Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran to the 1938 Munich agreement that empowered Hitler. Yet, he was spared.

I love AIPAC. It’s an incredible organization of dedicated Jewish communal volunteers and professionals who are wholly dedicated to the America-Israel relationship. AIPAC is a modern miracle of Jewish organization and commitment, and its Executive Director, Howard Kohr, is a man of humility and a gentleman in every sense of the word.

AIPAC’s official reaction to the reaction to Donald Trump’s speech, however, was out of character for an organization famous for its diplomacy and inclusiveness. Surely President Obama wasn’t going to hold the organization accountable for remarks delivered from its podium by independent speakers. And if AIPAC’s members welcomed Trump’s remarks, that was their prerogative.

And certainly AIPAC celebrates First Amendment rights of self-expression. By any measurable standard, Trump’s speech was extremely compelling, even if it was a sharp critique of President Obama’s policies. An organization is not liable for the words of its guest speakers and therefore cannot censor them. In a political venue in an election year, strong opinions will appear. To try and restrict them would leave the speakers with nothing much to say.

Some at the time claimed that the organization’s decision to criticize candidate Trump was taken to alleviate tension that might arise with an African-American community who might take offense at Trump’s barb at the first black President. But I can’t imagine that was the thinking. The African-American community, like the Jewish community, is not monolithic and can handle criticism of African-American leaders and policies, just as the Jewish community can in relation to its leaders.

Perhaps AIPAC’s leadership believed, as did so many back then, that Trump didn’t have a chance. Better to offend a businessman than the President of the United States and a party that would almost certainly inherit the White House.

Whatever the reason, AIPAC’s reaction was unfortunate, resulting as it did in the marginalization of America’s premier pro-Israel group with the new administration.

Nevertheless, just months into his term, Trump already has the track record to earn AIPAC’s respect and applause. The organization should do everything in its power to mend fences with the president. They ought to take advantage of Police Conference to try and improve what is undeniably their most critical relationship.

It begins with expressing simple regret, followed by sincere thanks.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said last week that she supports a filibuster to stop the Supreme Court nomination of federal Judge Neil Gorsuch, claiming that he is “way outside the mainstream.”

“We need to have a judge who’s kind of acceptable to both sides,” Warren said on National Public Radio’s Morning Edition Friday. “That’s the reason there’s a 60-vote rule in effect on Supreme Court nominees.”

“I don’t think Neil Gorsuch meets that standard,” Warren said. “Here’s someone — read his record.”

“In every opportunity to choose between corporate interests, big corporations and the little guy — employees, women, consumers — he always chooses the big corporations,” Warren said. “And I think that puts him way outside the mainstream of what we need.”

“So that means you — just to be clear — you would support a filibuster?” Host Rachel Martin asked Warren.

“Oh, absolutely,” Warren said.

Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) told Politico on Thursday that the Democrats would deny Gorsuch the 60 votes he needs to avoid a Senate filibuster and be confirmed to the High Court.

“There’s been an almost seismic shift in the caucus [against Gorsuch],” Schumer said as the Senate Judiciary confirmation hearings concluded on Thursday. “He did not win anybody over with his testimony.”

A Democratic filibuster would leave it up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) whether or not to change Senate rules requiring a 60-vote confirmation to a simple majority vote on the nominee.

President Donald Trump has expressed support for changing the rules or employing what some refer to as the “nuclear option.”

“If we end up with that gridlock I would say if you can, Mitch, go nuclear,” Trump said, as reported by CNN. “That would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web.”

“It’s up to Mitch, but I would say go for it,” Trump said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0db516b0:241b145:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Saturday Night Live star Michael Che is not apologizing for calling Boston, Massachusetts the “most racist city” he has ever visited.

Che had originally made the remarks during a “Weekend Update” segment on the NBC show the night before the Super Bowl. “I just want to relax, turn my brain off, and watch the blackest city in America beat the most racist city I’ve ever been to,” Che told SNL viewers.

@GerryCallahan @KirkAndCallahan yep figured you appreciate this one from SNL last night. pic.twitter.com/bwqrAGNsXv — Junk_That_Jersey (@junkthatjersey) February 5, 2017

The controversial comment came up again Thursday during an appearance at Boston University.

Che explained that he had received a ton of angry feedback over his Boston remarks, the Boston Globe reports. He said he had responded to one woman, who was exceptionally outraged by the line, by insisting that she “talk to your closest black friend and ask them to explain it to you.”

“Touche,” the woman replied, according to Che.

The 33-year-old New York native also slammed Trump Thursday, telling the audience that it would be better if Trump was running another country instead of being in “our own little slice of crazy.”

Che reportedly made it a point to tell the audience that he never apologizes for his comedic language or for his controversial statements because he’s “just trying to be more presidential.”

After the presidential election, Che told Esquire magazine that he agreed with President Trump’s criticism that SNL is politically “biased” and one-sided — opting to ding Republicans and conservative viewpoints far more than Democratic and liberal dogma.

“Oddly, I agree with him,” he said. “We try to write that way. But I do agree with him. I think the show should show all views and we make a conscious effort to do so.”

In his March 20 speech in Louisville, Kentucky , President Trump sounded many familiar and important themes, including the importance of jobs, manufacturing, trade, and the need to revive the coal industry. And yet he also added a new and larger “meta-theme,” namely, the urgency of building up our industrial strength for the sake of economic and national security. That meta-theme, we might observe, is the essence of the “ American System ” of Henry Clay.

Henry who? Let’s let Trump, speaking on the 20th, describe him: “Henry Clay was the legendary Kentucky politician who became the eighth Speaker of the House in 1811.” The President continued, “Clay was a fierce advocate for American manufacturing. He wanted it badly.”

Then Trump pivoted from manufacturing to another favorite subject, trade— specifically, fair trade. He quoted Clay speaking of trade, back in 1832: “To be fair, it should be fair, equal, and reciprocal.”

Trump added that Clay always warned against trade that was not, in fact, reciprocal. Nearly two centuries ago, the Kentuckian railed against fake free trade, which “would throw wide open our ports to foreign production without duties, while theirs remains closed to us.”

To these words, Virgil can only add: The more things change, the more they stay the same. Yes, then and now, America must be wary of playing the sucker’s game of opening up our markets to imports, while other countries close down their markets to our exports.

And yet as we know, in many cases, it’s already too late: We’ve been suckered in our trade dealings with Japan, Mexico, China, and many other countries. Indeed, in 2016, Trump was fully alert to that reality when other politicians weren’t, and that’s a big reason why he’s in the White House today.

Indeed, Trump had a strong message last year, and now, in 2017, he is strengthening it by making a connection to the taproot of American economic nationalism—the “American System.” In fact, the 45th President name-checked Clay no less than seven times, and used the phrase “American System” three times.

This is big. This is historic. Why? Because it indicates that the platform of “Trumpism”—which elitist critics have dismissed as populist pandering and rank demagoguery—is in fact, an agenda deeply informed by the best traditions of American history. It was the American System that built up this country, giving us widespread prosperity and also, crucially, the material muscle we needed to win the wars we had to fight. The factories envisioned by Clay were, truly, the “arsenals of democracy,” to cite the famous phrase of Franklin D. Roosevelt that Trump, too, has proudly used.

In fact, it’s fair to say that the American System was the dominant economic school of thought in the US until the 1970s. Then, over the next few decades, it was disastrously pulled down, and today, we see the consequences all around us.

And yet now, thanks to Trump, the American System is showing signs of a comeback. Admittedly, the administration must put meat on the bones of Clay’s memory, but at least it has made a start.

One might think, incidentally, that reporters would take at least a bit of notice.

Yet the MSM never fails to surprise—and disappoint. Journalists, slavering after every last piece of scandal and gossip, almost entirely ignored Trump’s citing of Clay and his System in that Kentucky speech. There was no mention of it in Politico, nor in The Washington Post, nor in The New York Times, nor on CNN. Not even the The Louisville Courier-Journal took note. In fact, about the only reporting on it that Virgil could find came from Breitbart News’ Charlie Spiering.

Okay, so let’s talk more about Clay (1777-1852). As Trump said, he was elected Speaker of the House in 1811, and yet in fact, his political career stretched over the first half of the 19th century. He was also a US Senator, Secretary of State, and a major party’s nominee for president in three national elections. (In one of those races, Clay was up against another Trump favorite, Andrew Jackson—but that’s a tale for another time.)

Yet it’s his American System that puts Clay permanently in the pantheon. And one fan of Clay’s, we might note, is another pantheon-dweller, Abraham Lincoln. Upon hearing the news of Clay’s death, Lincoln delivered a 5400-word eulogy for the leader that he described as “the beau ideal of a statesman.” And late in his life, the 16th President said of himself, “I have always been an old-line Henry Clay Whig” (the Whig Party being the predecessor to the Republican Party).

And so Virgil was intrigued when he heard Trump, in his earlier March 15 speech at Willow Run, Michigan, use the words “American Model” in the context of industrial renaissance. As this author observed two days later, Trump was hitting all the right Clay notes.

Okay, so what, exactly, is the “American System”? As the economic historian Michael Lind argued in his 2012 volume, Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States, the three keys to a Clay-type American System are, first, a protective tariff against unfair trade practices; second, a pro-industry system of banking; and third, a steady stimulus for technological innovation.

We can look at each in turn.

First, fair trade. Clay’s argument, echoing that of his illustrious forerunner, Alexander Hamilton, was that American jobs and wealth depended on robust manufacturing capacity here at home, and if that required a protective tariff, so be it. We might note that another great American firmly in the Clay tradition was Theodore Roosevelt. Indeed, in 1895 TR declared:

Thank God I am not a free-trader. In this country, pernicious indulgence in the doctrine of free trade seems inevitably to produce a fatty degeneration of the moral fiber.

As we all know, the Trump administration has already scored successes in its bid to revive the Hamilton-Clay-Lincoln-Roosevelt line of thinking. The Trans Pacific Partnership is dead, as is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Indeed, the Trumpians have forced other changes, too. Hence this encouraging March 19 CNN headline: “Trump 1, free trade 0: G20 drops pledge to fight protectionism.” Moreover, on March 20, Politico headlined, “White House prepares sweeping review of trade deals.”

Second, a pro-industry banking system. In a nutshell, America needs banks that focus on lending to industry, not speculating in high finance.

And so for the Trump administration, a key test will be its willingness to go toe to toe with Wall Street on the reimposition of Glass-Steagall-type banking regulation. That 1933 law, we can recall, simultaneously protected small depositors and restricted speculative, casino-style banking. Unwisely, Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999, during the Clinton administration—and we all remember the speculation-driven financial meltdown of less than a decade later.

During the 2016 campaign, Trump called for a “21st century” version of Glass-Steagall. So now, in 2017, we will have to see what pro-industry reforms might emerge.

Third, stimulus for innovation. It is, after all, technological innovation, and the accompanying productivity increases, that generates wealth. Way back in 1776, Adam Smith pointed out this reality in his classic, The Wealth of Nations. In a revealing illustration, Smith cited improvements in pin manufacturing. As he noted, a single worker, working by himself, might be able to make one pin a day. And yet, he continued, if the work was done by a team in a factory, such that the production was specialized and divided—in the 18th-century anticipation of the modern assembly line—then ten workers might produce 48,000 pins in day. That’s a 480,000-percent increase in per-worker productivity. It’s from such quantum leaps in industrial output, of course, that our prosperity was built.

So now to the obvious question: How to get more such productivity increases? One answer, of course, is free enterprise. The study of history, as well as common-sense observation, tells us that competition in the marketplace has a way of bringing out the best performance in people. And thus it was, as Adam Smith so famously wrote, that an “invisible hand” increases aggregate well-being.

And yet we need more than that. We also need a systemic plan for improving technology. And here again, we can be guided by our own history.

We can start by thinking about Henry Ford, creator of the modern assembly line, whose company operated the B-24 plant at Willow Run.

Without a doubt, Ford was a genius who flourished in economic freedom. Yet the infant Ford Motor Company, founded in 1903, had a lot of help: Like every other American company back then, it was shielded by a tariff, and it had plenty of access to capital from local banks; those were the days before seemingly every bank was headquartered in New York City or Charlotte.

Yet there was another critical element in Ford’s success that’s needed just as much today: incentives for new technology.

And why is that? Because the free market does not always spur technological leaps, of the sort that Adam Smith noted in the late 18th century and that Ford engineered in the early 20th century. In fact, as often than not, the free market incentivizes cutting prices—and costs. And that’s because of the nature of competition. That is, one lemonade stand on the street, competing with all the other lemonade stands, tends to focuses on selling lemonade cheaper; there simply isn’t the time, or the money, to plan some outside-of-the-box boost in lemonade productivity. We can step back and observe: Cut-throat competition doesn’t necessarily build things—it cuts throats.

Is the reader perhaps wondering about this point about the way capitalism operates? Well, there’s no need to take Virgil’s word for it; we can get it from a capitalist. Here’s what the pro-Trump Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel wrote in his 2014 book, Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future:

Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away.

In other words, if everyone’s competing, they’re not likely innovating. And that suggests that the font of innovation needs to come from somewhere other than the competitive entity itself, such as, for example, a university, a research institute, or some lone tinkerer.

Virgil can quickly note: This is not an argument against free-market capitalism. Instead, it’s an argument for the sort of rich economic “ecosystem” described by Michael E. Porter of the Harvard Business School, in hundreds of books and articles.

And to that point, it’s worth recalling that back in the 19th century, the government played a constructive role, starting with free public education—of the sort that young Henry Ford received.

Moreover, in those days, the federal government played a positive role, and not just on trade; most notably, Uncle Sam’s military spending was crucial to the industrial economy.

In the early 1800s, federal armories, then government-owned, began experimenting with the idea of interchangeable parts as a way of speeding up production. (Interestingly, this superior approach to making things was also known as the American System.)

Such Yankee ingenuity soon radiated through the entire economy, gaining momentum thanks to the huge industrial purchases of the Civil War—not just rifles and bullets, but also everything from railroad locomotives to the newfangled thing called the telegraph.

(As an aside, Virgil would say that the epic conflict between Blue and Grey can be seen as, in the final analysis, a fight in which Northern manufacturing buried Southern gallantry under an avalanche of steel. Thus we can conclude: In a battle between the daring cavalier and the well-equipped artilleryman, it’s best to bet on the fellow with the bigger cannonballs.)

In the wake of all this Civil War mass production, new factories, and new habits of thinking, were vastly encouraged. And so, by the beginning of the 20th century, Henry Ford could reap the benefits of this pro-business technological incentivization—and then, of course, thanks to his individual genius, greatly expand upon those benefits.

Still, if we think about the major technological leaps of the 20th century—including aviation, electronics, antibiotics, synthetic rubber, nuclear power, the Internet, and GPS—we see that the military, and war needs, were behind all of them. Yes, it was private enterprise that commercialized these gains, but it was not entrepreneurs that originated them. This phenomenon of war-led innovation caused the University of Minnesota historian Vernon W. Ruttan to ask, “Is War Necessary for Economic Growth?” His tentative answer was darn close to, Well, it sure seems that way.

Yet from Virgil’s perspective, we don’t need to start a war to enjoy economic growth; we just need to think about the next potential conflict, and diligently cultivate the economic strength we would require.

In fact, we need, as the philosopher William James argued more than a century ago, “The Moral Equivalent of War.” That is, if we think about what Ford Motor Company, working with the federal government—and 42,000 Michigan workers, including Rosie the Riveter—accomplished at Willow Run during World War Two, we can draw all the economic inspiration we need to be rich—without dropping a single bomb.

With those winning precedents in mind, we can close by outlining an economic opportunity—and a political necessity. Namely: the full use of our abundant reserves of coal.

Once again, we can return to Trump’s speech in Louisville. As everyone knows, coal is a major industry in Kentucky—or at least it was. So it must have been heartening to Kentuckians to hear Trump say:

We are going to put our coal miners back to work. They have not been treated well, but they’re going to be treated well now. Clean coal, right? Clean coal.

Yes, just as Trump said, coal must be clean. And in its natural state, it’s true that coal contains toxic elements—including cadmium, chromium, and mercury—that are released into the atmosphere upon burning. Fortunately, thanks to technology, it’s possible to “scrub” coal. And if coal needs still more scrubbing to even cleaner? Very well, it needs more scrubbing; that’s a further mission for patriotic science, serving the public interest.

However, as we know, the environmentalists choose to say that none of this is possible, that coal is irredeemably dirty. And so, the greens continue, we must stop mining coal altogether—their favored phrase is “leave it in the ground.” Indeed, green activists, financed by billionaires such as Michael Bloomberg, have been litigating and regulating to shut the coal industry down, leaving thousands of workers, and their communities and states, stranded.

And sadly, they’ve been effective. We might consider this March 21 headline in Axios, a buzzy new Beltway publication: “The coal industry is sick—and it’s terminal.” As the accompanying chart shows, coal production nationwide has fallen by about a third in the last decade, and coal-mine employment has fallen by two-thirds in the last three decades.

Surveying the dire situation, we might make three points:

First, the Beltway seems weirdly eager to see the coal industry, and its workers, wiped out. Virgil wonders if it has something to do with anti-Red State prejudice. He even wonders if it’s a kind of slow-motion economic hate crime.

Second, a shutdown of coal would be a huge economic loss to the US. After all, according to Department of Energy, the total amount of coal underground in the US is 3.9 trillion tons. At the current price of around $50 a ton, that’s about $200 trillion dollars. Bloomberg and his hirelings might not need any of that money, but millions of Americans do, and so does the nation as a whole.

Third, we must be mindful of political reality—that is, the power relationships involved in mining and burning coal, as well as other fossil fuels. Virgil admits that he himself is not worried about global warming, but nevertheless, he believes that we all would do better if we acknowledge the likelihood that some sort of compromise between Big Green and Big Coal—make that, now, Little Coal—will be needed if miners are to keep their jobs, let alone have new jobs.

As Trump said in Louisville, we can have clean coal if we want it, and so let’s get it. Fortunately, the American System was designed to foster exactly that sort of technical evolution. Indeed, as we think about cleaning up coal, we must also think about dealing with carbon dioxide, aka, greenhouse gas. And so Virgil admired a recent article making the case for a crash national program of carbon capture.

Yes, Virgil was thrilled to see Trump talking about the American System of conscious economic development. It was a good idea then, and it’s a good idea now. So let’s put this new/old system through its paces!

And there’s no better American project than reviving the coal industry, and putting our miners back to work.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0db516b0:241b140:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A New York Times article pointed out that an alleged rape in Maryland went “virtually uncovered” on CNN, MSNBC, and most other networks, while Fox News devoted a considerable amount of time covering the incident.

The two alleged rapists, ages 17 and 18, enrolled as freshmen at a public high school in Rockville, Maryland, after federal immigration authorities detained and later released them even though they were in the country illegally, the Baltimore Sun reported.

The suspects allegedly forced a girl to perform oral sex on them in a bathroom stall while they raped and sodomized her, despite her crying out in pain, begging them to stop, police said.

Police investigating the incident found blood and DNA at the scene of the crime, Fox DC reported.

Left-leaning television networks left their viewers uninformed about the rape case, according to the Times.

Times writers John Koblin and Nick Corasanti said that, unlike the other networks, Fox News gave “considerable time” to what they called “a rape case in Maryland.”

They added that “viewers would not have heard” about the Rockville rape” if they had turned to CNN or MSNBC,” where the case was “virtually uncovered” on those networks.

The Times also said that Fox News was accurate in criticizing the other networks for not covering the issue, according to an in-story “fact-check” by the paper.

Even though the story was ignored by most networks, the alleged rape has generated national outrage.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the alleged rape by illegal immigrants is one of the reasons why President Trump is so “passionate” about cracking down on illegal immigration.

“This is a tragic event, and it is horrendous, and horrible, and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. I can’t possibly imagine,” Spicer said at the White House on Tuesday.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0d7e002c:23e05a6:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

One of the leading Trumpocrats, Billy Bova of Mississippi, is publicly calling for House Speaker Paul Ryan to do what is right by the country and President Donald Trump by resigning his position to move out of the way of the future of the Republican Party.

Bova was one of the key activists who was a lifelong Democrat who crossed over to support Trump for president against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton—working with the Trumpocrats PAC, which helped flip tens of thousands of registered Democrats in the key battleground states of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan.

In total, those states add up to 79 electoral votes—and without them, Trump would not have won the election. In each of those states, including especially razor thin margins over Clinton in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, it was the Trumpocrats who delivered the win—and the White House—to President Trump.

Bova made his comments in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel the morning after Ryan failed President Trump on healthcare.

“I think that it is time for him to go like it was time for [former Speaker John] Boehner to go like it was time for [former Speaker Nancy] Pelosi to go,” Bova told Breitbart News Saturday.

“President Trump is president because of 70-something-thousand registered mostly lifetime Democrat voters in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan—and those people bought into President Trump hard and were for him before they even supported him and voted for him because they love his America First populism. Our jobs first, our factories first, our legal citizens first, our military and veterans first.

“Those people understand that the establishment globalist corporatists of both parties—Republicans and Democrats—have sold them out. They’ve sold out our working and middle class here in America. They’ve sold out our country, people born here in America who were raised up and played by the rules and paid their taxes and are just looking for a level playing field.

“And they also realize that those folks that put President Trump in office, that he was correct on healthcare—that Obamacare should be repealed but you’ve got to do it in a way that gives people choice. It’s all about competition. The insurance companies have a monopoly. I live in the state of Mississippi—one health insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield, has 60 to 65 percent of the health insurance business. What if you lived in a state where AllState had 70 or 75 percent of the car insurance business? Everyone would be jumping up and down, screaming, ‘why can’t we get different insurance? I don’t need the ugly kind that they’re selling.’ So we have got to have competition in the marketplace.

“And Donald Trump is right, when we get competition in the marketplace. When people go to a restaurant they don’t want two items on the menu, they want 22 items to choose from on the menu because not everybody eats the same thing and not everybody needs to consume the same kind of health insurance or health care. It’s that simple.”

Bova said that a piece from Breitbart News’ John Carney detailing how Ryan is already contradicting President Trump’s administration on tax reform, the supposed next item on the agenda, is “exactly right” and questioned how President Trump can trust Ryan as he embarks on this next step.

“I don’t know how Donald Trump, President Trump and his advisers, how they are going to trust him in the future,” Bova said. “I think his credibility is basically destroyed here this past week as Speaker and as leader in the House of the Republicans on Capitol Hill.

“He dropped the ball, he tried to do an Obamacare Lite so as to not step on the toes of the big insurance companies and the status quo and the Big Pharma companies and all that stuff. I don’t know they could possibly trust him to try and give us a more fair and equitable and competitive tax structure. I just don’t know how he can be trusted to do that and to lead.

“It’s a shame, I’m sorry to say, but he was opposed to Donald Trump from the get-go. So was Mitch McConnell. Much of the leadership of the Republican Party in D.C. in the House and the Senate was opposed to him. I think they might smile and shake his hand, and slap him on the back and eat free lunch and dinner at the White House with him but I think they got back to themselves on Capitol Hill and they got their knives out again for him and for his White House and I certainly wouldn’t trust them from here on out.”

Bova said the failure of the American Health Care Act is entirely Paul Ryan’s fault, but undoubtedly Ryan’s mistakes will cause some “blowback” against President Trump. However, he added, the president can get back on track by steering clear of Ryan’s pet issues and focusing on what won him the White House.

“I think what we ended up with and unfortunately, the blowback—some of it is going to come back to the president—but he can rebound,” Bova said. “President Trump can rebound. He’ll recapture his narrative and get back on trade and economics and jobs and that kind of thing and illegal immigration and stuff like that.

“But I think what happened is Ryan and McConnell—especially Ryan and his top people over on the House side—figured they would just take the healthcare ball and run with it. I think this ultimately would have turned out differently if this had been Donald Trump and his top advisers and people there in the West Wing and in the White House, orchestrating it, laying it all out, writing it all out and explaining it to the people. I think we would have seen a much more different outcome than what we saw yesterday.

“I think Ryan and his gang of establishment, globalist, corporatist Republicans who want the health insurance companies to charge higher and higher premiums, who want the big pharmaceutical companies to charge higher and higher prices not lower prices, who want the big insurance companies to charge a 28-year-old completely healthy male another $200 a month for his health insurance because he has to have maternity leave benefits in it.

“I’m in my 50s, I’ve never needed maternity leave. I’ve needed basic, major medical health insurance as a working class person—American—middle-income American. I don’t need a $10,000 deductible, I need a $1,000 deductible.

“So I think it was just one more instance where the globalist, corporatist, establishment Republicans on the Hill led by Paul Ryan grabbed the ball, and took the ball and ran with it, and we ended up with this incredible debacle that unfolded this past week.”

Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” host George Stephanopoulos said President Donald Trump was “in a bit of denial amid these big questions” about his competence and credibility.

Stephanopoulos said, “Picking up on what you were saying, also sort of fixing problems, you have to first confront them, accept them. It does seem like the president is in a bit of denial amid these big questions about both his competence which you saw Senator Schumer raise and his credibility.”

The swamp in Washington encroaches on our very Mall, where it threatens to claim a planned memorial to Dwight Eisenhower which against all precedent has been designed without accountability to or participation from the American public.

Unsurprisingly the result is more contentious and expensive than any past presidential memorial, which hasn’t kept eleven appointed commissioners from trying to build it anyway. Now, without full funding in hand as the law requires, they are asking Congress for public money to build their design on a pay-as-you-go basis.

It’s a bad deal for the American people President Trump can prevent. Draining this corner of the swamp also comes with a prize that should appeal to our builder president, in the form of a better, cheaper, more public-spirited tribute to another leader who worked beyond party lines to make America great.

What makes the current proposal so bad? For a start, it is too big, with room to accommodate all three memorials to Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson side by side. The Eisenhower Memorial would cost as much to build as the three of those monuments together, so it is also too expensive. The design also takes an attitude to honoring President Eisenhower that is unclear at best, depicting him as a seated child with a life-size statue, which is always too small where public sculpture is concerned. This sculpture will occupy a vast park its designer calls a “theater for cars” on account of a ten-story metal screen that serves as its backdrop.

Controversy around a plan so different from other presidential memorials has delayed approval and funding for years. It all sounds so unlike the uncontroversial, personally modest President Eisenhower, but it sounds very much like memorial designer Frank Gehry, another problem with his design.

But it’s how we got Gehry’s design that’s the real problem. Every memorial commissioned for the National Mall since the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1981 was designed through public competitions, which invited all who were interested to submit designs. These were then judged anonymously based on merit, which is how a twenty-year-old college student named Maya Lin came to design the Vietnam memorial. In true democratic spirit these public competitions give equal opportunity to amateurs and professionals and focus on ideas, not personalities. They are widely accepted as fair, and they consistently deliver memorials on time and on budget.

The Eisenhower Memorial Commission ignored this standard public process and selected Gehry directly. The architect has close personal and professional ties to the commission’s then-chairman, with whom he worked on a past project for a concert hall in Los Angeles. Outright appointment being politically unfeasible, the commission turned to a government program used for federal courthouses and office buildings, which considers only registered architects and seeks designers, not designs. Congressional investigators found that for the Eisenhower Memorial the established selection criteria of this program were changed, in a way that benefited Gehry by placing more emphasis on reputation, where he is strong, and less on past performance, where his record of cost and schedule overruns leaves him weak.

That under Gehry’s direction President Eisenhower’s memorial has suffered exactly these problems should surprise no one. His design will cost more than twice its allotted budget, and he has already claimed or been pledged fees in excess of his original agreement based on a constantly expanding scope of work. Nor, given the fact he was chosen before he finalized a design, did Gehry have any incentive to keep costs or controversy down for fear his commission might go to someone else, as it would in a public competition where the winning design proved this problematic.

So the Eisenhower Memorial’s high cost and controversy follow directly from its architect’s undemocratic and possibly irregular selection. If we build his plan now, and on a pay-as-you-go basis no less, costs and controversy will only escalate. Eventually, they can confuse or undermine President Eisenhower’s legacy itself. That careful steward of the public purse was a defender of public process and a prophet and scourge of bureaucratic tyranny. He would have likely more than object to what–and how–his commission aims to build in his name.

As with so much of what’s been corrupted in Washington, it’s also the integrity of a larger public process that’s at stake. There is no good reason to abandon public competitions that reflect our political ideals and consistently work, nor to substitute for this democratic process what looks very much like insider patronage.

President Trump has the opportunity to fix President Eisenhower’s memorial and protect the public participation that should be part of it. This requires something he knows very well how to do–step into a wasteful process to get a long-delayed project built better and cheaper. Here’s hoping this opportunity is too good for him to pass up.

Sunday on MSNBC’s “Meet the Press,” Gov. Jerry Brown (D-CA) said in addition to President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall not being “Christian,” he pledged to do what it takes to fight it.

However, challenging the wall’s construction in the courts was not going to be one of the tactics, he said.

“[W]e’re not going to bring stupid lawsuits or be running to the courthouse every day,” Brown said. “We’re going to be careful. We’ll be strategic.”

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus has publicly defended his years-long friend House Speaker Paul Ryan amid Ryan’s failure on healthcare.

“No he doesn’t,” Priebus said when asked on Fox News Sunday if President Donald Trump wants Ryan to resign.

“He believes what he said in the Oval Office on Friday, he doesn’t blame Paul Ryan,” Priebus said. “He thought Paul Ryan worked really hard, enjoys his relationship with Paul Ryan, thinks that Paul Ryan is a great speaker of the house. None of that has changed.”

Priebus’ comments came after Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro called for Ryan to resign on Saturday night.

“Paul Ryan needs to step down as House speaker,” Pirro said in a lengthy rebuke of the Speaker, demanding his resignation. “The reason: He failed to deliver the votes on his health care bill.”

.@JudgeJeanine: &quot;Paul Ryan needs to step down as Speaker of the House.&quot; https://t.co/LBJGBALEx8 pic.twitter.com/k2tRj9Goz6 — Fox News (@FoxNews) March 26, 2017

Pirro’s call for Ryan’s resignation came after President Trump tweeted earlier on Saturday that Americans should tune in to Pirro’s program on Saturday night. Pirro noted in her call for Ryan to resign that she did not talk to the president about it, but it is unclear if the president knew about it.

Watch @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00 P.M. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017

On Fox News Sunday, Priebus told host Chris Wallace that he thinks the president’s Tweet and her call for Ryan’s resignation were “more coincidental.”

“First of all, I will go on record, we do love Judge Jeanine, and so does the president,” Priebus said. “I think it was more coincidental.”

However, Priebus added, he had no way to know for sure if the president knew that Pirro was going to call for Ryan’s resignation over his failure on her show.

“I did not talk to the president about the Tweet,” Priebus said. “I’m just telling the truth. There is no preplanning here.”

Jonathan Swan of Axios offered an alternative theory on Twitter, suggesting that promotions for Pirro’s program focused on that the show would include new revelations on Trump’s allegations that former President Barack Obama’s administration surveilled his campaign and transition.

This makes much more sense. https://t.co/KJLlbRu0zR — Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) March 26, 2017

Swan also quoted a “leadership aide,” presumably from Ryan’s office—that is how Ryan aides like their blind quotes attributed—denying that Ryan is in trouble at all.

Per leadership aide: &quot;The president and speaker spoke by phone for almost an hour today about regrouping and moving forward on the agenda.&quot; — Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) March 26, 2017

“The president and speaker spoke by phone for almost an hour today about regrouping and moving forward on the agenda,” a leadership aide told Swan on Saturday night.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer, a Priebus and Ryan ally who on Friday evening told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum that Ryan’s future was up to members of the U.S. House, has not answered follow-up requests for comment on this matter.

On Sunday morning, at the urging of Priebus per a White House aide, the president tweeted blame at the House Freedom Caucus for what happened to Ryan’s healthcare bill.

Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood &amp; Ocare! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2017

But blaming the Freedom Caucus is not even close to the whole story. In fact, senior House GOP sources in non-Freedom Caucus offices tell Breitbart News that the vote—if it would have happened—would have lost more moderates than Freedom Caucus members. House Appropriations Committee chairman Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) and moderate non-Freedom Caucus members Reps. Frank LoBiondo (R-NJ), Mark Amodei (R-NV), Barbara Comstock (R-VA), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Rep. David Young (R-IA), Rep. David Joyce (R-OH), as well as many more moderates were against the legislation publicly. Tuesday group co-chairman Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA), a leading moderate, came out in public opposition to the legislation too. Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC), a conservative not in the House Freedom Caucus, came out against the bill publicly as did many other conservatives not in the House Freedom Caucus, too.

In fact, several senior House GOP aides and House GOP members in both Freedom Caucus and non-Freedom Caucus offices confirmed to Breitbart News that had the bill gone to the House floor for a vote there may have been as many as 100 House Republicans who voted against it. There is no way that the Freedom Caucus comprised the majority of Republicans opposing the bill.

Part of the reason why Ryan urged Trump to call off the vote he previously wanted—several House GOP leadership sources close to the Speaker tell Breitbart News—is because Ryan did not want the president to know what people like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) have been saying all along was true: the bill did not have much support inside the Republican conference in the House. Sen. Paul even said in an interview with Breitbart News that Speaker Ryan was deliberately misleading the president on this front. A floor vote would have demonstrated that fact, since more moderates—again, as many as 100 Republicans were prepared to vote against the bill—would have voted against it than House Freedom Caucus members.

Nevertheless, Priebus, during his Wallace interview, said Trump “hit the bulls-eye” with the Tweet he urged the president to send out despite its inaccuracy.

WH Chief Reince Priebus just said on Fox News Trump &quot;hit the bulls-eye&quot; with this tweet. https://t.co/rD9OGnu4eD — Sean Sullivan (@WaPoSean) March 26, 2017

For different reasons than the Republican establishment, Trump has had a longstanding feud with the Club For Growth. The group ran attack ads against him during the entire 2016 primary process, and the now president—in an interview with Breitbart News—called the Club a “pack of thieves.” Since Trump won, the Club For Growth has praised Trump on some matters and attacked him on others. But the Heritage Foundation has been solidly with Trump, with the exception of this legislation, as have been most members of the House Freedom Caucus.

In fact, the House Freedom Caucus members stood with Trump when most establishment Republicans—at Ryan’s urging—dropped him in October in the throes of the campaign. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the group’s chairman, was an ardent defender of Trump’s before he officially endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) in the GOP primaries last year. But even after he endorsed Cruz, he never bashed Trump—and always publicly defended Trump. When Trump won the nomination, Meadows went on to campaign with Trump and aggressively work to help elect him—proving to be an instrumental force in the battleground state of North Carolina with its 15 electoral votes.

The same cannot be said for Ryan, in the battleground state of Wisconsin. Ryan abandoned Trump, never campaigned with him, and Trump won Ryan’s home state and its 10 electoral votes anyway without the Speaker’s assistance.

Spicer has not answered when asked whether Priebus believes that Comstock, LoBiondo, Amodei, Ros-Lehtinen, Frelinghuysen, Young, Joyce, Dent, and all the other moderates who outnumbered Freedom Caucus members in opposition to Speaker Ryan’s bill also “have saved Planned Parenthood &amp; Ocare!”

It turns out, too, that the alleged Planned Parenthood defunding in the legislation was, according to Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY)—another conservative who was opposed to the bill but is also not in the House Freedom Caucus—not real but a “bait and switch.” Massie cited the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report to respond to the president’s Priebus-inspired Tweet on Sunday morning to point that out.

I take it GOP leadership still hasn&apos;t told Trump the PP provision was a 1yr bait and switch? See page 23 of CBO https://t.co/O9cGKQeqzb https://t.co/yKVPG1UvHe — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 26, 2017

On top of all that, though, the healthcare bill was deeply unpopular. Every poll that came out about the legislation showed deep dissatisfaction with it, and hinted at potential a potential anti-GOP bloodbath in favor of Democrats in the midterm elections in 2018.

Politico’s Tara Palmeri reported on Saturday that the president is again considering removing Priebus. Spicer, on Saturday evening, denied these reports to Breitbart News.

Source close to @POTUS says he&apos;s being advised to replace @Reince45 &amp; is open to possibility — healthcare was last straw — Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) March 25, 2017

“She is an idiot with no real sources,” Spicer said in an email about Palmeri when asked about her Tweet.

But Palmeri is the Politico reporter who broke the story earlier in the administration about how several original White House staffers failed to pass FBI background checks and had to be fired and walked out of the premises by security. That story turned out to be accurate. Palmeri also last week broke the story, with colleague Ben White, that Dina Powell would be deputy National Security Adviser. That was also accurate.

Spicer has not responded to a follow-up email, but Breitbart News can independently confirm the increase in chatter on the Priebus front—including multiple White House staffers and others close to the president over the past three days have told Breitbart News the replacement of Priebus is a possibility.

The White House, however, remains deeply divided on this front—and even some of Trump’s most ardent allies from the nationalist populist wing inside the White House, like chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and his closest allies, support Priebus. They are afraid that ousting Priebus may empower former Goldman Sachs chief Gary Cohn, a liberal Democrat who is director of the National Economic Council, to swoop into the position and move the White House irreparably to the political left—crippling Trump’s agenda once and for all. But many other names from the outside are being considered, sources close to the president both inside and outside the White House tell Breitbart News, and it remains to be seen what may or may not happen.

The New York Times’ Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman also reported this weekend that Trump is blaming Priebus for the healthcare failure.

“On Friday evening, a somewhat shellshocked president retreated to the White House residence to grieve and assign blame. In a search for scapegoats, he asked his advisers repeatedly: Whose fault was this?” Thrush and Haberman—who the president himself called after Ryan’s health bill was pulled off the House floor—wrote.

Increasingly, that blame has fallen on Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, who coordinated initial legislative strategy on the health care bill with Mr. Ryan, his close friend and a fellow Wisconsinite, according to three people briefed on the president’s recent discussions. Despite the public displays of unity with the speaker, Mr. Trump and his team now regret outsourcing so much of the early drafting to Mr. Ryan. One aide compared doing that to a developer’s staking everything on obtaining a property without conducting a thorough inspection. And they were stunned by his inability to master the politics of his own conference.

Priebus, in the Wallace interview on Sunday, defended his own job performance and future.

“I’m not in any trouble,” Priebus told Wallace. “I’ve got a great relationship with the president, we talk all the time. Just before coming on the set he gave me a call.”

Priebus dismissed that New York Times report as “gossip.”

“This is gossip, and it’s always going to happen,” Priebus said when asked about the Thrush-Haberman story. “I don’t really care about it, I’m looking forward to accomplishing the president’s agenda moving forward and working with anybody in the legislature to make sure that that happens.”

White House staff tell Breitbart News that Priebus was running point on the healthcare bill, not other staffers who joined in later to try to help save the bill, as moderates outnumbered conservatives in opposition to it. Furthermore, top Trump allies both inside and out of the White House disagree with Priebus’ efforts to publicly defend Ryan.

Priebus and Ryan have been friends and political collaborators for years, both rising to the national spotlight alongside one another from Wisconsin. In August 2012 in The Atlantic, Molly Ball wrote a piece detailing how alongside Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker—a former Trump rival—Priebus and Ryan were the “Cheesehead Mafia.”

“Ryan, Walker and Priebus are three of the GOP’s brightest national stars, and Wisconsin — the state that helped birth the Progressive Movement and shape the New Deal — is suddenly the leading exporter of a hard-charging, sharply ideological brand of conservatism,” Ball wrote. “The Republican trio sometimes dubbed the ‘Cheesehead Mafia’ have made their state ‘the capital of the Obama-era Republican resistance,’ as one writer put it. And they are reshaping the Republican Party.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0be03903:25accf8:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Alec Baldwin’s mocking parody of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live has helped propel the show to its strongest ratings in years — but the actor denies that the now-famous impression helped Trump win the White House in November.

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph to promote his latest animated film, The Boss Baby, the 58-year-old actor said that people had approached him after the election to tell him that his impression helped smooth out Trump’s edges and had helped “humanize” him.

“There were people who came to me after the election and said, ‘Well, how do you feel that you are, to some degree, responsible for Trump winning the election?’” he told the outlet. “I thought they were kidding, but they said, ‘You humanised him. You took the edges off and made him more personable.&apos;”

“I don’t agree with that,” he added.

Baldwin debuted as Trump during the 42nd season premiere of SNL in October last year. The show’s skits initially mocked the debates between Trump and former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and after Trump won, they took aim at the president’s penchant for tweeting and for his confrontation with the 9th Circuit Court over his executive orders on immigration.

Baldwin has previously said that playing Trump is “not always fun,” and recently said he planned to retire the impression in the near future.

“As an actor who studies other people, I was completely convinced that when Trump won, he would completely transform himself,” the actor told the Telegraph. “Like in sports, when you beat the hell out of somebody and you win, you shake hands, maybe have a beer together, and you’re a more polite, obliging person. But with Trump, there was none of that.”

“He was as bitter and miserable after he won as he was before. That is a complete mystery to me,” he added.

Offscreen, Baldwin has been a fierce critic of the president. On the eve of Trump’s inauguration, the actor appeared at a rally outside Trump Tower in Manhattan alongside other anti-Trump celebrities including Michael Moore, Robert De Niro and Mark Ruffalo. Baldwin has also teased Trump on Twitter.

But the actor says that despite his skewering of the president, he does not see his impression as being part of a larger “resistance” against Trump.

“People thank me for ‘the resistance’ that I’m participating in, but I don’t see it that way,” he told the Telegraph. “I don’t mind if people do, but I don’t do it for that reason. I do it to entertain people. It’s purely about entertainment.”

The Algemeiner reports: “When it comes to the great challenges facing Israel and the United States, for the first time in many years, perhaps in many decades, there is no daylight between our two governments,” the Jewish state’s top diplomat in Washington declared on Sunday.

Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer was speaking at the opening session of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s annual policy conference at the Washington Convention Center.

According to Dermer, “there was a meeting of the minds” when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with US President Donald Trump last month at the White House. “That has made me even more confident that our alliance will be considerably stronger in the years ahead,” Dermer went on to say.

Sunday ABC’s “This Week,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said President Donald Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border wouldn’t get the votes on either the Democratic or Republican side.

Schumer said, “The border wall should be talked about, shouldn’t be rammed down people’s throats for a whole bunch of reasons. First, it’s not the best way to protect the border, everyone agrees on that. Second, it’s very expensive. Why don’t we use that money for roads? Third, let’s give the president a little chance to get Mexico to pay it.”

“Isn’t that what he told everybody that we weren’t going to pay it?” he continued. “Fourth, it’s got a big problem that Republicans in border states are opposing, Texas, Arizona, because there’s eminent domain, so you have to take private land. So instead of trying to jam it through on this short-term budget and saying take it or leave it, we should debate it in 2018’s budget over the summer. And, by the way, my prediction, it wouldn’t get the votes on either the Democratic or Republican side.”

The Jerusalem Post reports: The overwhelming majority of Democrats in the US House of Representatives urged President Donald Trump to reaffirm the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as U.S. policy.

With 187 of 193 voting Democrats signing, the letter to Trump released Friday is a pointed reminder of how divided the parties remain on how to define pro-Israel. It comes on the eve of an American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference that the lobby had hoped would be a signal of bipartisan support for Israel.

J Street, the liberal Jewish Middle East policy group, lobbied for the letter, initiated by Reps. David Price, D-N.C. and Gerry Connolly, D-Va. “It is our belief that a one-state outcome risks destroying Israel’s Jewish and democratic character, denies the Palestinians fulfillment of their legitimate aspirations, and would leave both Israelis and Palestinians embroiled in an endless and intractable conflict for generations to come,” said the letter, signed by 191 members.

The Times of Israel reports: Israel and the US are close to reaching an understanding on settlement construction that would see Jerusalem commit to construction limits in return for being allowed the build the first new settlement in 25 years, Channel 2 reported Saturday.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to build a new settlement for the residents of the illegal West Bank outpost of Amona, which was evacuated in January, but has encountered resistance from the administration of US President Donald Trump.

Netanyahu’s office denied the report as “not true.” The report comes amid mounting speculation on the outcome after four days of high-level discussions between the administration and an Israeli delegation, which concluded Thursday.

A former Georgia congressman and member of the House Appropriations Committee told Breitbart News on Friday that President Donald Trump’s proposed cuts to the foreign aid budget strike him as the right thing to do.

“I think it is a good time to do a head-to-toe review on our foreign aid,” said Jack Kingston, who is now a CNN commentator.

“If there is a good reason to spend the money and it fits into our national security or even our economic goals, I am sure the president would spend the money at the appropriate level, but I think what happened is that the foreign aid budget has just ramped up over time with less and less supervision.”

“Who do we give the money to? How can we do it better? What do we get out of it? Are we actually creating dependent countries? Or are we creating independent, prosperous potential trade partners and military allies?” he said.

Kingston spoke to Breitbart News after President Donald Trump released his “America First: A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again” March 16, which was a quick adjustment to the fiscal year 2017 continuing resolution passed in December that funds the federal government through April 27. The fiscal year 2018 budget is on a separate track.

The president’s budget request makes a 28 percent cut in the outlays for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development.

According to the summary from the White House Office of Management and Budget, the budget request “Refocuses economic and development assistance to countries of greatest strategic importance to the U.S. and ensures the effectiveness of U.S. taxpayer investments by rightsizing funding across countries and sectors.”

The summary also said the budget request “Recognizes the need for State and USAID to pursue greater efficiencies through reorganization and consolidation in order to enable effective diplomacy and development.”

Kingston said that with a new administration it is the perfect opportunity to give a fresh look to overseas aid programs to reorient them to the new administration’s priorities.

The former congressman said that as a former Capitol Hill appropriator, he has developed his own set of metrics to evaluate a foreign aid program.

“If we give money to a country, are they a firm ally? Are we accomplishing a three-to-five-10-year goal?” he said.

“In my experience with the State Department, we haven’t had those kind of metrics; case-in-point, when you look at some of the countries we give aid to and they claim to be great allies, look at their voting record in the UN–and they are not voting with us,” he said. “If you can’t count on them as your ally, what are we doing it for?”

American taxpayers are glad to help anybody who needs help, he said. “However, the taxpayers expect more accountability about how their hard-earned money is spent,” he said.

Kingston said he represented the southeast corner of Georgia, between Savannah and the Florida line, and not once did a voter complain to him that America was not spending enough on foreign aid.

“It never happened. In fact, most people don’t want us spending money on foreign aid when we have so many domestic problems, crime problems in the inner cities, road and infrastructure issues, health care issues,” he said.

“People believe charity begins at home.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0b3a98e2:24949c4:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said President Donald Trump was moving forward with his agenda of a “border tax.”

Priebus said, “Moving forward the president’s vision on taxes is going to unite not just the Republican Party, but I think some Democrats will come on board as well. We can provide one of the biggest middle-class tax cuts in the history of this country, that’s important. I think another thing that’s important to the president as a potential border tax to even of the playing field between our country and countries around the world.”

He added, “He’s not backing off of that. You go back and watch President Trump’s interview from the 1980s, the 1990s, the early 2000’s. He’s been talking with us his entire life. I think now more than ever he’s more going to stick to his guns and his heart and the convictions that he’s laid out to the American people for decades. He’s not going to turn his back on his core principles. I think his core principles have broad admiration in both parties.”

Democrats and “progressives” who gathered at a town hall in the San Francisco district of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday pressed her to revive the “single-payer” option for national health care — i.e. a government-run system.

The pressure came after Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, at the urging of President Donald Trump, withdrew the American Health Care Act, the House Republican leaders’ effort to replace Obamacare. The measure lacked the 218 necessary votes.

Local public radio station KQED reported:

“I extend my hand to the president if he wants to improve the Affordable Care Act,” Pelosi told a crowd of several hundred people gathered at a town hall meeting at Balboa High School in San Francisco. … The first audience question was more of a long argument for a socialized health system that some are calling “Medicare for all,” which would eliminate insurance companies. Pelosi, unruffled by the at times unruly crowd, noted: “I supported single payer since before you were born.”

While Pelosi would not commit to the idea, it has long been a proposal beloved by the Democratic rank-and-file. In the 2009-10 debate over Obamacare, Democrats reluctantly abandoned the so-called “public option” because it could not overcome moderate opposition, including from then-Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-CT).

However, Democrats hinted that a single-payer system could eventually replace Obamacare. Many conservatives charged that Obamacare had been set up to fail precisely so that Democrats could eventually introduce socialized medicine as a replacement — a “Trojan Horse” tactic.

On Friday, President Trump said that he is open to negotiation with Democrats about replacing Obamacare at a future date.

Anti-Trump protesters launched violent attacks on supporters of President Donald Trump at rallies across California on Saturday, but the media uniformly downplayed their role.

In headlines reporting the violence, media outlets either seemed to blame the Trump supporters for the violence, or used passive language that made the violence seem to have erupted as a natural consequence of the events.

Ironically, the text of the actual articles often made clear that anti-Trump protesters were to blame, but the headlines — which create a stronger impression, and are all that a casual reader may notice — uniformly refused to place blame where it belonged. Instead of “Anti-Trump protesters attack peaceful pro-Trump rally,” or some variant thereof, readers in California saw to the following:

LAist.com: “Pro-Trump Rally in Huntington Beach Turns Violent”

Text:

A pro-Trump rally in Huntington Beach Saturday morning erupted in violence, according to the LA Times. A man protesting the rally pepper sprayed a female organizer of the rally, after which other pro-Trump supporters tackled and punched him. Video of the fight shows the counter-protestor getting assaulted and running from pro-Trump supporters. Members of the rally followed him and other counter protestors with chants of “USA,” “America First,” and cries for them to “get out.” The counter protestor eventually fled and ran along Pacific Coast Highway before getting detained by California Highway Patrol officers. The other counter-protestors fled the scene.

Violence erupted at a Make America Great Again rally in Huntington Beach on Saturday after a protester opposed to President Trump allegedly doused a female organizer of the event with pepper spray, sparking a brawl that ended with several arrests. A group of flag-waving Trump supporters tackled the man with the pepper spray, who was wearing a black mask, and started punching and kicking him, according to witnesses. Several other fights also broke out between demonstrators.

The Bee reprinted the Times article, adding the detail about arrests to the headline — without, of course, indicating who had been arrested.

Los Angeles Daily News: “Fight breaks out at Pro-Trump Hollywood MAGA rally; 2 arrested”

Text:

A fistfight broke out along the sidewalk when a man grabbed a Trump supporter’s hat. Los Angeles police on bikes arrested two men for possible assault. But instead of being met by an expected counterdemonstration and potential violence, marchers were met by mostly sidewalk sneers and jeers in largely Democratic Los Angeles.

Orange County Register: “Pro-Trump rally draws 2,000 marchers, some protesters and a violent brawl”

Text:

As the marchers, many in MAGA hats or carrying American flags, walked down the bike path from Pacific Coast Highway and Warner Avenue, about a dozen protesters wearing black masks formed a wall blocking them. The situation got ugly and lasted for about a half hour; after much yelling, shoving, pushing and punching, some protesters pepper-sprayed a group of marchers. Four protesters were arrested, California State Parks Police Capt. Kevin Pearsall said.

A pro-Trump rally in Sacramento proceeded without incident.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump supporters were routinely blamed for violence at rallies, even when they were the victims. The Democratic mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, blamed Trump for an anti-Trump riot on the streets around a Trump rally last June, in which Trump supporters were chased, beaten, and bloodied.

Elsewhere, Democratic operatives intentionally instigated violence at pro-Trump rallies with the specific goal of attracting media attention and creating a sense of “anarchy” around the candidate.

(AFP) — Iran will impose sanctions on 15 US companies for their support for Israel and its “terrorist actions,” state news agency IRNA said Sunday.

The decision, which is largely symbolic because the firms do not do business with Iran, comes two days after the US announced new sanctions on a number of foreign firms accused of collaborating with Iran’s weapons program.

Iran’s sanctions target US firms that provide arms and equipment to Israel “for use against the Palestinians,” IRNA said.

“All transactions with these firms are forbidden, their assets will be seized and their officials will not be able to obtain a visa,” it added.

The firms include United Technologies, ITT Corporation, Magnum Research INC, Military Armament Corporation and Bushmaster Firearms International.

The list also included Re/Max Real Estate, which Tehran accuses of “buying and selling homes in settlements located in the occupied territories.”

Tensions have mounted between Tehran and Washington since US President Donald Trump took office in January.

On Friday, Washington announced sanctions against foreign firms and individuals over allegedly collaborating with the weapons programmes of Iran and North Korea.

Trump has repeatedly criticized a July 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that saw the Islamic republic curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

Washington last month imposed new sanctions on individuals and companies supporting Iran’s ballistic missile programme and on its elite Revolutionary Guards.

US lawmakers are now seeking to further increase pressure, proposing a new law that would see Iran’s Revolutionary Guards listed as a terrorist organization.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0b1f0121:2477924:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Washington Post described Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole as a “frequent defender of President Donald Trump” Saturday when he blamed House conservatives for forcing Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) to pull his American Health Care Act at the last minute.

The bill also had its fair share of critics from the more moderate wing of the party — which has led some to conclude it’s not about Ryan or Trump but the hard-to-reconcile nature of the GOP right now. “This is not a failure of leadership; it’s a failure of follow-ship,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a frequent defender of both Ryan and Trump.

Here are the top five times, in ascending order, this “frequent defender” of Trump went out of his way to attack him:

5. Cole: Trump must apologize to President Barack Obama

Politico reported March 17:

Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, said Friday that President Donald Trump should apologize to former President Barack Obama for accusing him of ordering an illegal wiretap of his phone lines, given that there is no public evidence to support it. “I see no indication that that’s true,” Cole told reporters. “And so it’s not a charge I would have ever made. And frankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling proof, then I think the president, you know, President Obama is owed an apology in that regard.”

4. Cole: Trump’s proposed budget cuts short-sighted

Talking Points Memo reported March 17:

The Republican congressman said that the CDC protects Americans from diseases like Ebola and that the NIH does crucial research on cancer and Alzheimer’s Disease. “So these in my view are cuts that are very short-sighted. These are investments the country ought to be making,” he said, adding that funding for health research is as important as defense spending. Cole also indicated that Congress would not approve the deep cuts Trump proposed to the Environmental Protection Agency, though Cole said he had not studied that part of the budget blueprint closely.

3. Cole: Trump needs to stop shooting from the hip, I oppose his Muslim ban

On NPR’s July 18 On Point program Cole said:

Still, Rep. Cole conceded his party’s soon-to-be standard bearer could clean up a few elements of his fiery campaign rhetorical style. “He’s very much a shoot-from-the-hip kind of guy,” Cole said. “Let’s take the Muslim ban: I would disagree vehemently with that, it’s just not constitutional.”

2. Cole: Trump’s captured audio disgusting, crude, and vile

Ada, Oklahoma’s Ada News reported Oct. 13:

U.S. Rep. Tom Cole weighed in on the controversy surrounding Republican candidate Donald Trump’s remarks on a 2005 recording in which Trump was heard having a vulgar discussion with then-Access Hollywood personality Billy Bush on a live mic. “Absolutely appalled,” Cole said. “It’s disgusting. It’s crude. It’s vile. There’s no defense for it whatsoever. People shouldn’t be shy about saying that.”

1. Cole: Trump must stop using “pejorative” term “Pocahontas” to refer to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)

The Washington Post reported June 10:

Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), normally a ferocious Trump foe, was similarly unfazed. “It’s pretty funny, I thought,” Graham said. “I think what he said about the judge was racist. When you’re talking about a politician, you got to be able to take a joke. . . . If this bothers you, you need to get out of politics.” But others were alarmed. “He needs to quit using language like that,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of the Chickasaw tribe and one of two Native Americans in the House. “It’s pejorative , and you know, there’s plenty of things that he can disagree with Elizabeth Warren over, this is not something that should, in my opinion, ever enter the conversation. . . . It’s neither appropriate personally toward her, and frankly, it offends a much larger group of people. So, I wish he would avoid that.”

It should also be noted the Cole worked behind the scenes to make Ryan the GOP presidential nominee at the Republican National Convention in late May and in early June told MSNBC’s Morning Joe program that the speaker endorsed Trump under pressure, because he had no choice.

This is also the same congressman who joked about lighting up a cigar with ultra-liberal Rep. George Miller (D-CA) as he and the rest of his friends on both sides of the aisle crafted the 1,603-page omnibus spending bill in December 2014.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b08dbce0f:21dd3fc:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

During her opening statement on Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” host Jeanine Pirro ripped House Speaker Paul Ryan, calling for him to step down after his healthcare bill to replace Obamacare failed miserably.

“Paul Ryan needs to step down as speaker of the house,” Pirro began. “The reason? He failed to deliver the votes on his healthcare bill, the one trumpeted to repeal and replace Obamacare, the one that he had seven years to work on, the one he had under lock and key in the basement of Congress, the one that had to be pulled to prevent the embarrassment of not having enough votes to pass.”

Later, Pirro said, “I want to be clear, this is not on President Trump. No one expected a business man to completely understand the nuances, the complicated ins and outs of Washington and its legislative process. How would he know which individuals upon which he would be able to rely?”

Saturday morning, President Trump tweeted out a teaser for “Justice,” telling everyone to watch.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that Speaker Paul Ryan’s fate would be “up to members of the House” after the failure of the House Obamacare replacement bill.

In an interview with Fox News, Spicer noted that President Donald Trump was “complimentary” about Ryan’s performance, but that it wasn’t up to him to say whether or not the Speaker would remain in his position.

“He knows how hard he worked to get this where it is— it was a very, very heavy lift—it was one of the most comprehensive reforms not just of healthcare but of entitlements that we haven’t seen in 30 years.”

Spicer said that the White House wanted to get the bill through but that they would continue to pursue the president’s agenda.

“The agenda moves on. We’ve got a very, very bold and robust agenda, and the president promised to the American people we’re going to roll on,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b08a4be63:21a1d6b:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In President Donald Trump’s weekly address to the nation, he reviewed a unique moment in the history of NASA, its Hubble telescope, and the future of the James Webb space telescope as he highlighted this week’s signing of the NASA Transition Authorization Act into law.

Trump began telling the country that he was honored to sign the bill in the company of astronauts. He continued, “With this legislation we renew our national commitment to NASA’s mission of exploration and discovery and we continue a tradition that is as old as mankind — we look to the heavens with wonder and curiosity.”

Trump recalled 1995 when billions in taxpayer dollars were going to the Hubble Space telescope.

The astronomer in charge had a novel idea. He wanted to use the expensive telescope in a total unconventional way. Instead of pointing Hubble’s eye at nearby stars or distant formations, Robert Williams wanted to peer into the void. He aimed the massive telescope at one of the emptiest regions of the night sky. For ten days during Christmas of 1995, Hubble stared into the abyss, seeking whatever light it could glean from the darkness, and it was total darkness.

Trump went on, “Williams was rewarded and the entire world was struck by the awesome images our satellite returned.”

Hubble returned images of thousands of lights, said Trump, each one representing an entire galaxy. “The unforgettable image did not satisfy our deep hunger for knowledge—it increased evermore and even more and reminded us how much we do not know about space, frankly, how much we do not know about life.”

Trump said that the the reauthorization will continue such success with the James Webb telescope, set to launch in 2018. “It will gaze back through time and space to the very first stars and the earliest galaxies in the universe.”

“NASA’s greatest discoveries teach us many, many things,” said Trump, who lauded Congress’s ability to work together to “reaffirm our nation’s commitment to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.”

He said one lesson was, “the need to view old questions with fresh eyes, to have the courage to look for answers in places we have never looked before, to think in new ways because we have new information.”

“Most of all, new discoveries remind us that in America, anything is possible if we have the courage and wisdom to learn,” the President continued.

“I am confident that if Americans can achieve these things, there is no problem we cannot solve, there is no challenge we cannot meet, there is no aim that is too high” said Trump. “We are a nation of problem solvers and the future belongs to us.”

A peaceful march to support President Donald Trump, as well as veterans, law enforcement, and first responders, was briefly interrupted by a dozen or so anti-Trump protesters Saturday in Huntington Beach, California.

Police arrested four people after they allegedly used pepper spray on the marchers during the peaceful procession attended by about 3,000 on the beach in Orange County. According to the Los Angeles Times, the dozen or so counter-demonstrators — including one who wore a patch that said, “Only You Can Resist Racists Liars” — all refused to identify themselves, but one claimed that the group only used pepper spray after they were shoved and punched by their rivals.”

Video evidence appears to indicate otherwise:

Capt. Kevin Pearsall of California State Parks told the L.A. Times that six people were originally detained but only four were arrested. He said three men were arrested on suspicion of illegal use of a Taser, and one woman was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery. None of their names were immediately released.

Pearsall said all of those arrested were counter-demonstrators.

Users across Twitter noticed recently that searches for the terms “racist” and “Hitler” return the profile of President Donald Trump.

Users began posting screenshots on Twitter recently showing that when they searched for terms such as “Hitler” or “racist”, one of the first results returned by Twitter’s search engine is the profile of President Donald Trump. Alongside the President’s profile is that of a user literally named “Adolf Hitler.”

Breitbart recreated the search with similar results.

When searching for the term “racist,” similar results can be seen below,

One user posted a screenshot that appeared to show Breitbart News official Twitter page listed under the search results for the term “fascist.”

However, when attempting to recreate this, Breitbart did not find our own Twitter profile listed but did find the accounts of President Trump, Sean Spicer and Kellyanne Conway amongst the results.

Twitter has previously done little to curb direct threats of violence against the President or his family, allowing “Rape Melania” to trend on the site for hours. The website has also allowed as many as 12,000 tweets calling for the assassination of President Trump.

Twitter, which recently reported an extremely poor quarterly earnings report, has not responded to a request for comment on the results at this time.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0851f727:2191d2e:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The pro-Common Core New Mexico education secretary who once served as a staffer in former Gov. Jeb Bush’s administration in Florida is no longer a candidate for assistant secretary of the U.S. Education Department, reports Politico.

Hanna Skandera’s name was pulled from consideration for the position, the report says, because about a dozen Senate Republicans “were skeptical that they could ever vote yes” to confirm her, due to her support for the highly unpopular Common Core standards.

Skandera was deputy education commissioner under Jeb Bush and also a senior policy adviser and deputy chief of staff at the education department under former U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, who served under President George W. Bush.

Like Jeb Bush, Skandera is a proponent of the Common Core standards. She is head of the governing board of the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), one of the two federally funded test consortia that developed assessments aligned with Common Core.

President Donald Trump campaigned on getting rid of the Common Core standards, and a far-reaching network of grassroots citizens across the country are vehemently opposed to the federalized program that was introduced in President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill.

Emmett McGroarty, a senior fellow at American Principles Project, released the following statement:

We applaud the Administration and the Senate for scuttling the nomination of Hanna Skandera due to her past support for Common Core standards and testing. Parents, students, and teachers detest Common Core because it locks children into an inferior education. As President Trump has said, Common Core “is a total disaster.” We urge the Administration to look for appointees committed to achieving the President’s vision that “education has to be at a local level. We cannot have the bureaucrats in Washington telling you how to manage your child’s education.”

Though U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has funded and served organizations that promote Common Core – including Jeb Bush’s Foundation for Excellence in Education – since her nomination, she has denied she supports the controversial standards.

DeVos, nevertheless, has surrounded herself with advisers and staff who have ties to Bush’s foundation, as well as to Indiana, where Common Core was repealed, but then simply “rebranded.”

The secretary recently said the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) “essentially does away with the notion of a Common Core,” a statement many grassroots parent activists still battling against the Core in their states have rejected.

Upon DeVos’s nomination, KOB4 in Albuquerque reported Skandera praised Trump’s pick, saying that while she did not know her well, she believed DeVos’s policies would not change Common Core in New Mexico.

Breitbart News reached out to the press office at the U.S. Education Department to confirm the report but received no response.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b07ff4afe:213b144:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Saturday, Democratic strategist and former Clinton campaign manager Jess McIntosh said on MSNBC’s “AM Joy” that President Donald Trump is “absolutely a dystopian super villain.”

“Trump is absolutely a dystopian super villain, like for sure,” McIntosh said in a discussion about the new “Justice League” trailer.

Mother Jones’ David Corn then chimed in, adding that White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is a super villain and “perverse form of Gotham City.”

One day after the American Health Care Act (AHCA) vote was canceled for a second time, Vice President Mike Pence told West Virginians at Foster Supply Company in Charleston that 100 percent of House Democrats and a handful of Republicans were to blame for standing in the way of President Trump’s health care bill, but a report has surfaced that in the final days before passage of the bill, Pence pushed to label the bill “Ryancare.”

UPDATE: The Vice President’s office told Breitbart News on Sunday that it denies the conversation about naming the bill “Ryancare” ever took place.

“The President and I are grateful for Speaker Paul Ryan and all the House Republicans who stood with us in this effort to begin the end of Obamacare,” said the Vice President, who lamented, “As we all learned yesterday, Congress just wasn’t ready.”

While on Saturday Pence referred to the plan as “President Trump’s,” aides have suggested that in the days before the vote on AHCA was supposed to happen, the Vice President lobbied to label the bill “Ryancare,” according to the New York Times which reported:

Until the final week, Mr. Trump’s team was deeply divided over whether he should fully commit to a hard sell on a bill they viewed as fundamentally flawed, with Vice President Mike Pence pointedly advising the president to label the effort “Ryancare,” not “Trumpcare,” according to aides.

Earlier in his speech, Pence joked that they could have used some of Small Business Administration leader Linda McMahon’s WWE superstars on Capitol Hill to get the AHCA passed.

“With 100 percent of House Democrats, every single one, and a handful of Republicans actually standing in the way of President Trump’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, we’re back to the drawing board,” said Pence.

He spoke of the negative effects of Obamacare on businesses and individuals, adding in statistics specific to West Virginia.

The Vice President said he was inspired by the President’s tireless efforts, “determination, and commitment to keep his promise to the American people,” in working to get the AHCA “across the finish line.”

Pence noted the words of the former House Speaker who had overseen the passage of Obamacare, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who on Friday called the news that the bill was pulled a second time, a “victory.”

Pence responded, “Yesterday wasn’t a victory for the American people, it was a victory for the status quo in Washington, D.C. and it was a victory for the disaster of Obamacare, but I promise you, that victory won’t last very long.”

“The American people want Obamacare gone,” he continued.

After the Friday announcement that the bill had been pulled, President Trump blamed the Democrats for the downfall of the AHCA. He added, “I want to have a great health care bill and plan and we will, it will happen, and it won’t be in the very distant future.”

Pence went on to declare on Saturday, “We’re moving forward.”

He said that the Administration is going to move forward with their three-part agenda, “jobs, jobs, and jobs, in West Virginia and across this country.”

“Last month the economy added 235,000 jobs in construction and manufacturing,” said Pence, who noted companies changing plans to move plants and jobs outside the country and deciding rather to build in the U.S.

Pence said, “Working with this Congress, President Trump is going to “pass the largest tax cut since the days of [former President] Ronald Reagan.”

“We’re going to reform the tax code and make it flatter and simpler and fairer,” he added. “Our tax plan will make American businesses and American opportunities more competitive all over this country.

Pence vowed that they will cut corporate taxes. He said they would cut business taxes “to 15 percent so American companies will invest in American operations that create American jobs.”

He spoke also of the reduction of regulations to help get the economy moving.

“The war on coal is over and a new era of American energy has begun,” Pence said as he spoke of mining companies in West Virginia depressed under the politicians in Washington, D.C. “West Virginia has lost more than a third of its mining jobs over the last few years alone, that over 130 mines have been shut down since 2009.” He said the hard working men and women of that state will be forgotten no longer.

“President trump digs coal,” he continued, a rallying cry seen on Trump campaign signs during the 2016 election cycle.

“It’s about jobs, it’s about energy, it’s about our National Defense,” said Pence, who added the campaign promise fulfilled by the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States.

“The United States Senate will confirm Neil Gorsuch one way or the other,” said Pence who, as Vice President, also serves as President of the U.S. Senate.

While stating on Friday that the failure of the AHCA makes tax reform more challenging, President Trump said that Obamacare will “explode” and that the process of trying to pass the AHCA will ultimately lead to a better health care bill.

President Trump addressed the failure of the Obamacare replacement bill for the first time on Twitter after Congress pulled the bill from the House floor.

Trump tweeted:

ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017

“ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

The House pulled the American Health Care Act from the House floor Friday after it became clear that the House was not able to secure enough votes for the bill’s passage.

Trump told the media Friday afternoon that the bill’s failure would help Congress put together a better healthcare plan, but he also blamed the Democrats for opposing the bill.

“Certainly for me it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it’ll be an experience that leads to an even better healthcare plan,” Trump said.

“We were very close. It was a very tight margin. We had no Democrat support, no votes from the Democrats,” he added.

Trump specifically singled out House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as the reason for the bill’s failure.

“The losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because they own Obamacare. They 100% own it,” Trump said. “They have Obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future.”

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said Friday that the failure of the Obamacare replacement bill will make tax reform harder but not “impossible” after the White House sent a message that President Trump’s tax reform and infrastructure agenda will not be affected by the failed healthcare bill.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0722c591:200617e:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Left-wing documentary filmmaker Michael Moore says Republican lawmaker’s failure Friday to pass a bill to repeal Obamacare opens the door for Democrats and progressive pressure groups to rev up their opposition to President Donald Trump’s agenda.

“This is not the time for the Democrats to gloat,” Moore warned during an appearance on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes.

“This is the time we have to now double down,” Moore added. “Please understand that Trump is telling you the truth when he tells you that Obamacare is going to explode or implode. They are going to actively make sure that that happens”:

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan decided Friday to pull his party’s Obamacare replacement bill, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA). The move spurred celebration from liberal lawmakers and anti-Trump celebrities.

But Moore also said the bill’s failure is evidence that the president cannot keep his campaign promises.

“A lot of people, they’re getting it. They’re getting that they were lied to,” Moore explained. “A lot of promises were held out to them that aren’t going to come true. And they saw just how transparent the Republicans and Trump were with this bill.”

“This was a tax cut bill for the rich, not a healthcare bill,” the Academy Award-winner added. “This was an attempt now to try and kill Obamacare in actually more cruel ways because they’re going to try to nip and tuck and cut HHS to get in the way of what Obamacare does.”

Conservative and moderate Republican lawmakers opposed the AHCA, as did an overwhelming majority of American voters.

A California group is launching a controversial “No Sanctuary Campuses” campaign, calling for President Trump to defund any state university that declares itself a “sanctuary” and to prosecute state and university officials promoting “sanctuary” for criminal aliens as “secessionists.”

Fox News reports that the “David Horowitz Freedom Center plans to target 11 state schools and wants University of California President] Napolitano — the former head of homeland security — to be “prosecuted for sedition.”

In a post on his organization’s website, David Horowitz states: “This is the most massive movement of sedition since the Civil War and is the centerpiece of the so-called ‘resistance’ — itself a form of sedition in a democracy — that Democrats have mobilized against the Trump administration.”

In response to the “sanctuary movement” —which Horowitz characterizes “as a concerted effort by left-wing administrations in major American cities to undermine the Patriot Act and make it more difficult for the Department of Homeland Security to ferret out terrorists and criminal aliens, and deport them” — Horowitz’s group is putting up “WANTED” posters featuring Napolitano and Cal State University Chancellor Timothy White.

Horowitz is promoting the campaign as an antidote to the efforts of California Democrats to turn California into a “sanctuary state” by spread[ing] this seditious movement from our cities to our colleges and universities, and, in California, to make the entire state a sanctuary for foreign criminals.”

Horowitz’s mission: to defend “free societies whose moral, cultural and economic foundations are under attack by enemies both secular and religious, at home and abroad.”

According to Horowitz, defunding entities promoting “sanctuary” from immigration enforcement is not enough.

“De-funding is a good first step,” Horowitz says in his online post, “but is not enough to counter-act the serious threat that the sanctuary movement poses to our nation’s security in the midst of the global war that Islamists have declared on us. What is needed is the prosecution of the criminal officials leading this movement. The Department of Justice needs to investigate and indict the mayors of these municipalities and the derelict presidents and chancellors of sanctuary campuses.”

The Freedom Center’s “No Sanctuary Campuses” campaign was supposed to begin last month at UC Berkeley when Milo Yiannopolous was scheduled to speak, but violent leftist protestors shut down the event.

Starting with 11 campuses in California, Horowitz plans to expand his campaign nationwide targeting public “sanctuary campuses” in the coming weeks and months.

Friday on Fox News Channel’s “The Five,” while discussing President Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) decision to not go forward with a vote on the American Health Care Act, co-host Eric Bolling said Ryan falsely led Trump to believe the bill was ready to pass.

Bolling said, “Think about long it took to get Obamacare through. It took time President Trump has been the commander-in-chief for 60 days, 60 and a couple days. They pushed that through. And if they really wanted — I don’t hate Paul Ryan. All you people saying you hate Paul Ryan. I hate what he did to the president. He led the president to believe this thing was ready to be passed. It could have passed but they need — Dana made a very good point. It needed a lot more discussion. It needed a lot more negotiating before they presented it.”

Left-wing celebrities wasted no time Friday celebrating Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s decision to pull the Obamacare replacement bill, known as the American Health Care Act (AHCA).

After two days of high-stakes gamesmanship, President Donald Trump requested that the bill be pulled, CNN reported.

The move led to a flood of mocking and gloating from some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. Comedian Drew Carey called it Trump’s “worst day as president,” while other stars like Mark Ruffalo thanked far-left pressure group the #Resistance for forcing lawmakers to cave on the bill.

Below is a roundup of reactions:

Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Mark Levin made the case that President Donald Trump’s reaction to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision not to proceed with the House GOP’s legislative effort to repeal and replace Obamacare was a positive.

Levin called it “actually outstanding” and likened that leadership style to former President Dwight Eisenhower.

“I thought the president’s comments today were actually outstanding,” Levin said. “And he showed enormous humility. And this guy doesn’t give up. I mean, he said OK, we’ll fight another day. In essence, he said that events will reach a point where this is going to have to be resolved. And when it reaches that point, I’m. ‘Mark, that’s not leadership.’ But it kind of is, actually. I’m not making a comparison. It is the sort of way that Dwight Eisenhower managed. When things reach a certain point, they’ll be knocking on my door. Then we’ll figure things out.”

The White House tried very hard Friday to send a clear message that the success of President Donald Trump’s tax and infrastructure agenda does not turn on the fate of the Obamacare replacement bill.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, only minutes after pulling his health care bill, appeared to at least partially contradict that.

“Yes. This does make tax reform more difficult,” Ryan said. “But it does not in any way make it impossible.”

Even though Ryan went on to say the House would “proceed with tax reform,” he appeared to be far less optimistic than the two top Trump administration economic officials who spoke earlier on Friday. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin both had essentially the same message Friday morning: plans for tax reform, job creation, trade deals, and infrastructure spending remain intact regardless of what happen to the health care bill.

Standing on the White House lawn Friday morning, Mulvaney told CNBC that President Trump decided to stop negotiating with lawmakers over the healthcare bill because he “has other things he wants to do.”

“He wants to get tax reform done. He wants an infrastructure bill approved. He’s got other jobs programs moving through the White House,” Mulvaney said.

Mulvaney went on to say that the White House does not believe tax reform will turn “one way or the other” based on the fate of the Obamacare replacement bill.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Friday morning said passing a tax-code overhaul would be easier than replacing Obamacare.

“In a way, it’s a lot simpler,” Mnuchin said at an event sponsored by Axios. “In health care, it’s a much, much more complicated issue.”

The administration is close to completing its tax reform proposal, according to Mnuchin. He said that the proposal would be aimed at delivering a tax cut for the middle class and would include reforms to both personal and corporate taxes. The administration would push to get Congress to pass a tax bill before the August recess, Mnuchin said.

Many in the business community and on Wall Street have recently voiced concerns that tax reform might be stalled until 2018 or even later.

Mnuchin also spoke about the administration’s infrastructure spending plan, saying that he expected most of the $1 trillion to be financed primarily by private capital backed by loan-guarantees and private-public partnerships.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b05bc8dcc:1e92790:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Friday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” host Sean Hannity used his opening monologue to react to House Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision not to proceed with a vote on the so-called American Health Care Act, which would have been the opening salvo for Republicans trying to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

Hannity argued Republicans must make sure this doesn’t happen in the future and point to the flaws in the legislative process where improvement must be made. However, he emphasized the outcome was not the fault of President Donald Trump.

“Let me be very clear here,” Hannity said. “This is not President Trump’s failure. President Trump went above and beyond and did everything in his power to get this bill across the finish line.”

Hannity went on to take aim at the media and the Democratic opposition to the bill but reiterated that measures should be taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again.

President Donald Trump met with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Charter Communication CEO Tom Rutledge to announce thousands of new jobs returning to the U.S. from overseas. The company will hire 20,000 new positions over the next four years — 800 in Texas.

Charter Communications “brought back many jobs that had been shipped overseas,” President Trump said in an Oval Office announcement. “When American workers win, America as a country wins.”

“I am thrilled to announce that Charter Communications has committed to investing $25 billion here in the United States and is committed further to hiring 20,000 American workers over the next four years,” the President announced in a video streamed live from the Oval Office. “Charter has also pledged to completely end its offshore call centers.”

The President said 100 percent of Charter’s call centers would be based in the U.S.

“We have a President that is living up to his campaign promise, and that is to create more jobs,” Governor Abbott said while sitting next to the President in the Oval Office. “I want to thank Charter Communication for expanding in the great state of Texas. We’re happy that this first tranche of your expansion is in the Rio Grande Valley, In McAllen, Texas.”

“This is a win-win,” Abbott concluded. “It’s a win for the President; it’s a win for Charter; it’s a win for the great state of Texas. The country is better today because of the jobs that will be created tomorrow in McAllen, Texas.”

“I was proud to join in today’s announcement, and I thank the President and Charter Communications for their commitment to bring jobs back to America, creating hundreds of jobs for hardworking Texans in the process,” Governor Abbott said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “The Rio Grande Valley has always been a vital part of the Texas economy, and this new facility is a testament to the high-quality workforce in McAllen. As Governor, I will continue to work with the Trump administration and all partners to promote policies that create jobs and spur a new chapter in American economic growth.”

In Texas, Charter Communications is investing $17 million to open a new Spanish-language call center in McAllen. More than 600 Texans are expected to be hired to work in the facility, the governor’s statement revealed. Additionally, Charter will expand a recently opened call center in San Antonio. Together the two operations will provide more than 800 new jobs for Texans.

“With the opening of our first bilingual call center in McAllen, Texas we’re adding 600 good paying jobs to the Rio Grande Valley and providing a better experience for our Spanish-speaking customers across the country, most of whom previously would have had their calls routed to centers located outside the United States,” Tom Rutledge, Chair and CEO of Charter Communications said in the governor’s press release. “By bringing these jobs to McAllen, we’re strengthening the south Texas economy, and getting closer to Charter’s goal of hiring 20,000 employees in the next four years.”

President Trump celebrated the State Department’s successful conclusion of the Keystone Pipeline permitting process at the White House, after years of the project being stymied by the Obama administration.

“It’s going to be an incredible pipeline, greatest technology known to man or woman, and frankly we’re very proud of it,” Trump said on Friday.

Trump met with TransCanada executives in the Oval Office including the company CEO Russ Girling.

“I know Russ, you’ve been waiting for a long, long time and I hope you don’t pay your consultants anything because they had nothing to to do with the approval,” Trump said. “In fact you should ask for the hundreds of millions of dollars back that you paid them because they didn’t do a damn thing except get you a ‘no’ vote, right?”

After the meeting, Girling told reporters that under Trump the Keystone Pipeline was approved “sure a heck of a lot quicker.” Trump signed an executive order, requiring a 60 day timeline for approval of the project, a deadline that was met by the federal government.

“It’s a great day for our company and a great day for the workers who are going to be put to work,” he said.

Girling admitted that the lengthy permitting process under the Obama administration was frustrating for the company, posing “great problems and great cost” before it was ultimately rejected.

“Now we’re in a place where we can work together,” he said.

He said that the company was looking forward to obtaining additional permits from local governments to get the project started.

“Hopefully within the next year, we’ll be able to put people to work,” he said, assuring that the company would look to buy American materials for the project and put Americans to work.

“I think this is a win win all the way around,” he said.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, and White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner were also present for the event.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b05a0f74a:1e39882:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The most important point to make about the failure of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) on Friday afternoon is that it’s not the final word on the Trump presidency—much as some in the media might hope that it is.

Yes, The New York Times called the bill’s failure a “humiliating defeat” for the administration, and yes, The Washington Post labeled it “a big embarrassment,” and yes, Politico dubbed it a “staggering setback.” Without a doubt, many pundits will be clucking, chortling, and end-zone dancing for days and weeks to come.

Yet a look at recent presidential history tells us that such political obituaries are almost always premature; the presidency is a resilient institution.

As White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Friday afternoon, the Trump administration still believes that he has plenty of strength to pursue other priorities, notably, tax reform.

In addition, Virgil remembers the wise words of Ronald Reagan, who had his share of defeats—and more than his share of victories. Quoting an old Scottish ballad, he liked to say, in tough situations, “We are hurt; we are not slain. We’ll lie us down and rest a bit, and then we’ll fight again.” That was the optimistic, don’t-let-‘em-get-you-down spirit that made Reagan the effective leader that he was.

But first, a brief word about AHCA. It was a piece of legislation that nobody truly loved. It wasn’t ideologically pure enough for libertarian Republicans, and it wasn’t compassionately comprehensive enough for moderate Republicans. And yet since nothing about AHCA was acceptable to pro-Obamacare Democrats, it was entirely up to Republicans to see if they could muster the near-unanimity needed to pass it. Yet in the end, despite all the effort, AHCA pleased neither the House Freedom Caucus, nor what might be called the “Coverage Caucus.”

And at the same time, as a matter of legislative craftsmanship, much of the bill was dubious. In the words of Reason’s Peter Suderman:

The initial bill was awkwardly constructed on its own, a hodgepodge of disconnected policy ideas that relied on a system of tax-based subsidies and regulations that mirrored the essential structure of Obamacare in ways that, if anything, made even less sense than the health law the AHCA was supposed to replace.

So perhaps the true wonder is how it got as far as it got. Sometimes, legislation takes on a life of its own—or, perhaps one could say, a zombified death-in-life. That is, a bill shambles along, unloved and unlovable, until someone forces the issue. In this case, it was President Trump himself who pulled the ripcord on the legislation, to mix a metaphor. He chose to cut his losses, and he was wise to do so. (No doubt most House Republicans breathed a grateful sigh of relief.)

In fact, the President had often expressed skepticism about AHCA, as well as the strategy of leading off 2017 with Obamacare repeal. As Trump said as recently as March 15, “The Republicans, frankly, are putting themselves in a very bad position. I tell this to [Health and Human Services Secretary] Tom Price all the time.” That is, the Republicans would be better off leaving Obamacare alone, letting it collapse on its own—without getting GOP fingerprints on it. And in fact, on Friday afternoon, Trump told at least one reporter that he would revert to that stance; that is, let the Democrats, who voted for Obamacare in the first place, “own” the legislation.

Indeed, it’s quite possible that the GOP missed a bullet by not enacting AHCA. On Friday the 24th, a shudder went through Republican ranks when Breitbart’s Neil Munro reported on a new Democratic poll, purporting to show that when voters heard the details of the AHCA as it would have played out in the months and years ahead, they shifted 34 points in their assessment, from mild approval to sharp disapproval. To be sure, it was a partisan Democratic poll, but still, we might ask ourselves: Have we heard anybody, really, saying anything good about the legislation? So with a political albatross around its neck, what would it have been like for the GOP in the 2018 midterms?

Some will say, of course, that the failed health-insurance-reform effort these past two months counts as an albatross, too—but it’s only a small albatross, and in any case, it’s an albatross in the rear-view mirror.

So as we say goodbye to AHCA, one is reminded of what was said about a deceased character in the Shakespeare play Macbeth: “Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.”

Okay, so where does this leave the Trump administration? Is it, as gleeful critics are proclaiming, a shipwreck? A train wreck? Or merely a car wreck? Actually, maybe none of those. Virgil remembers other presidents who had early disappointments in the first six months of their presidencies, and, as we shall see, in almost all cases, they bounced back. Let’s take a look:

Jimmy Carter. In 1977, the Carter administration issued a “hit list” of public-works water projects that he wanted to kill; in response, the Democrats on Capitol Hill killed Carter’s hit list. Those were the days, we might note, when most Democrats supported big New Deal-ish infrastructure projects—that is, before the Democratic Party was Greened.

Ronald Reagan. In 1981, the Reagan administration issued a plan for deep Social Security cuts. It was the sort of proposal that only an ideologue could love; practicing politicians reacted with horror. Indeed, in May of that year, the Republican-controlled Senate voted 96-0 against the cuts.

George H.W. Bush. The Bush 41 White House chose former senator John Tower to be secretary of defense; on March 10, 1989, the Senate rejected Tower’s nomination.

Bill Clinton. In 1993, the Clintonians had the idea of a “BTU tax” (British Thermal Unit, a measurement of energy). The tax was complicated and scary-sounding, as well as far-reaching; such proposals never play well with the public— same as AHCA in our time. The BTU tax passed the Democratic-controlled House, but it was declared dead in the Democratic Senate on June 8 1993.

George W. Bush. On May 24, 2001, Bush 43 suffered a serious reverse when Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords switched from Republican to Democrat, thereby flipping control of the Senate from R to D.

Barack Obama. In 2009, the Obama administration pushed the “cap-and-trade,” which made Clinton’s BTU tax seem simple by comparison. Cap-and-trade was a complicated financial scheme to control carbon dioxide; critics dubbed it “Enron in the sky.” The misbegotten legislation passed the Democratic House on June 26, and that’s as far as it got; as with the BTU tax 16 years before, cap-and-trade died in the Democratic Senate.

In their time, each of these reverses was seen as a big deal. That is, pundits lined up to say that the “wheels are coming off of the administration,” and on and on. And while the pundits might not have been completely wrong, they mostly weren’t right, because in five of the six cases, the afflicted president made a recovery. (Only Carter failed to recover; in 1980, he lost to Reagan in a landslide.)

In fact, in four of the six cases cited above—Reagan, Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama— the president overcame the early defeat and went on to win a second term. Yes, the president’s party might have been walloped in the next midterm election (Reagan in 1982, Clinton in 1994, and so on), but by the end of four years, the administration had recovered sufficiently to win another four years.

We might pause over one of those two-term presidents—the greatest of this half-dozen—and learn some key lessons. That would be, of course, Ronald Reagan.

Having dug a hole for himself on Social Security in ’81, Reagan swiftly moved to dig himself out. He persuaded the Democrats that Social Security faced problems that did, in fact, need fixing, and so he worked with Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill to create the bipartisan Greenspan Commission, charged with coming up with a fix.

The Greenspan Commission deliberated all through 1981 and 1982, and then, in 1983, when passions over Social Security had cooled, it issued its compromise report and put the retirement issue to bed for nearly a quarter-century. (In 2005, George W. Bush had the not-so-good idea of partially privatizing Social Security, with disastrous consequences, but that’s a tale for another time.)

Yet in Reagan’s day, the Greenspan Commission was not regarded as a work of art, but it was seen as artful work. And in the meantime, Reagan, not letting himself be distracted, carried on with the essential work of his presidency, including tax cuts and tax reform, a big defense buildup, and the appointment of conservative judges. And, of course, the Gipper was re-elected in 1984 in a thundering landslide.

Thus the 40th President entered into the pantheon of American immortals: Yes, he made mistakes, but he knew how to recover from them, and keep his eye on the agenda ahead. History smiles on such leaders.

Now it’s Trump’s turn. Just like his predecessors, he’s had his early—and painful—baptism of fire.

So now he must lick his wounds, learn his lessons—and suit up for the next round.

As long as the subject is something other than health insurance, he has bright prospects.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b03b0d895:19906c5:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Twitter erupted with memes of President Trump sitting in a stationary truck following a photo-op on Thursday.

As reported by The Washington Post, “President Trump climbed into a big rig driver’s seat,” on Thursday and made a variety of faces while pretending to drive it.

“In the photos, he appeared to be having the time of his life. In one, he appeared to be screaming while clutching the steering wheel, as if speeding down a highway at breakneck speed. Another showed him clenching both hands into triumphant fists,” they explained. “A third showed him wearing an ‘I ♥ TRUCKS’ pin.”

Several memes satirizing the photos were made by the internet shortly after.

Capitol Hill conservatives took satisfaction in Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) decision to withdraw the American Health Care Act from the House floor Friday afternoon—minutes before congressmen were to vote on the bill crafted to rescue the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

“I applaud House conservatives for keeping their word to the American people and standing up against Obamacare Lite,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)—the sponsor of his own bill, the Obamacare Repeal Act, S. 554, which is the same legislation, with an updated timeline, to repeal major components of Obamacare that every Republican in the House and Senate voted to pass in 2015.

That bill was written and sponsored by Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), then the chairman of the House Budget Committee, now the secretary of Health and Human Services.

“I look forward to passing full repeal of Obamacare in the very near future,” the senator said.

Paul authored the free-market-based Obamacare Replacement Act, S. 222. This bill removes the Essential Health Benefits provision of Obamacare, expands what is permitted for the Health Savings Accounts, allows Americans to buy insurance across state lines, and allows Americans to form their own insurance buying pools.

No man is more responsible for the House Republican leadership pulling the Ryancare bill off the floor than Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. Meadows weathered incredible pressure from the White House and the Speaker’s team, but he would not give up on changes the HFC needed to have in hand before they swung around the over 25 solid No-votes the caucus whipped.

“I promised the people of North Carolina’s 11th District that I would fight for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement with a market-driven approach that brings down costs and provides more choices for the American people,” said Meadows, who was called out by President Donald Trump at Wednesday’s meeting between the president and the entire House Republican Conference.

“I remain wholeheartedly committed to following through on this promise,” he said. “I know President Trump is committed to repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a system that works for American families, and I look forward to working with him do just that.”

The man who founded and led the HFC before Meadows, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), said House Republicans cannot waste time putting together a better alternative to Obamacare.

“Obamacare is a disaster, and repealing it remains one of my top priorities,” said Jordan. “It’s why I introduced a clean repeal bill and have been pushing for a vote.”

Jordan said the American Health Care Act was not good enough. House Republicans owe it to our constituents to immediately get back to the drawing board and bring forward a bolder effort to replace the failing Obamacare with a plan to reduce costs by increasing choice and competition, he said.

We must immediately return 2 drawing board, bring bolder effort 2 replace #Obamacare w/ plan 2 reduce costs by increasing choice/competition — Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) March 24, 2017

Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee was a strong advocate of complete repeal of Obamacare, followed by a considerable time of debate about what to replace it with.

“The decision to pull this bill was a sound, commonsense one,” said. Lee. “We can now begin the hard and necessary process to get this right,” he added.

“The reality is that the current House bill was not ready for the House floor and certainly not ready for the Senate. We need an open, transparent, and deliberate process. The stakes for all Americans are simply too high for anything else,” the senator said.

Another strong conservative happy the bill got pulled is Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert, a former state judge.

Gohmert told Fox News host Neil Cavuto that the House Republican leadership pulled the bill because they knew they lost moderate congressmen; and if they pulled the bill before the vote they could blame it on the House conservatives and the moderates would get a hall pass.

Regardless of the politics Ryancare was flawed, the Texan said.

“This bill was going to be a problem,” Gohmert said.

“More federal government, more federal control is not the answer,” he said.

“The president gave it an incredible try on a bill that was really like he said – had some problems,” Gohmert added.

“People all over our conference were hearing from people at home saying that this is a disaster. ‘Please don’t do this.’ There’s so many noble people that were going, all right, ‘I’ll take one for the team but this is isn’t a good bill,&apos;” he concluded.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b0342712a:1b64ada:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The largest school district in Canada has canceled all future trips to the U.S.A. over fears that some of its students may be impacted by President Donald Trump’s travel order putting a temporary moratorium on travel from a list of terror-prone countries.

The Toronto School District announced its new policy on March 23 saying that no student or staff trips would be planned for the U.S. until further notice, according to The Washington Post.

School officials made the knee-jerk decision despite the fact that Canada is not on the list of seven countries identified by President Obama’s administration and as adopted by the Trump administration as dangerous due to rampant terrorism and deeply entrenched terror networks.

“We strongly believe that our students should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border,” Toronto School District Director of Education John Malloy said in a statement released on Thursday.

The district did allow that all the trips already planned will go ahead as intended, but that future trips are on hold.

“We do not make this decision lightly, but given the uncertainty of these new travel restrictions and when they may come into effect, if at all, we strongly believe that our students should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border,” the statement reads. “The TDSB remains committed to ensuring that fairness, equity, and inclusion are essential principles of our school system and are integrated into all our policies, programs, operations, and practices, including school trips.”

The district also warned that if any student’s identification is questioned at the U.S. border, the trip will be canceled on the spot and all students will be taken back home.

“Rest assured, we will continue to monitor this situation very closely and should we receive additional information or clarification with regards to what students could expect at the U.S. border, we may revisit these decisions,” the statement concludes. “However, based on all the information we currently have available to us, we feel this is the right action to take at this time.”

The Toronto school system serves over 289,000 students in 451 elementary schools, 110 secondary schools, as well as five adult education centers.

The Toronto schools aren’t the only Canadian schools to cancel trips to the U.S. The Greater Essex County District School Board of Windsor, Ontario, also recently canceled trips over the border.

In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason.

In this week’s exclusive installment for Breitbart News, Jackie has come up with a novel way for President Trump to be able to implement his desired executive order temporarily limiting immigration from six terror-prone countries.

All Trump has to do, Jackie explains, is announce that everyone will be allowed in, from any country and at any time — then he can watch as the Democrats and the rest of the opposition howl for a temporary travel ban.

“They don’t care if they come into this country, they want to get [Trump] out of the country,” Jackie says. “That’s what they’d like to see. Unfortunately, they can’t get it, so they’ll stop anything he wants to do. If he wants to buy a glass of milk, they’ll put a stop to it.”

Jackie says the president’s opponents would be “so happy to have a chance to disagree with him” that if he called for all terrorists to be allowed in they’d immediately call for limits.

“Positively not! Nobody can get in! Your own mother can’t get in!” the Democrats would say. “Your sister, your cousin; even if you got married last Thursday, you can’t get in!”

Kendrick Lamar — one of former President Obama’s favorite rappers — released a new song Thursday that trashes President Donald Trump.

The single “The Heart Part 4” sees the Compton, California crooner calling the commander-in-chief a “chump.”

“Donald Trump is a chump, know how we feel, punk. Tell ’em that God comin’. And Russia need a replay button, y’all up to somethin’,” Lamar raps on the political track. “Electoral votes look like memorial votes. But America’s truth ain’t ignorin’ the votes.”

(Explicit Language)

The Grammy-winner shared the song, which is also available on iTunes, with his 7 million Twitter followers.

The Heart Part 4 https://t.co/C9M7ZH1o4v — Kendrick Lamar (@kendricklamar) March 24, 2017

The song, however, is not the first time Lamar has dissed Trump in his music. On a song from rapper Isaiah Rashad, Lamar rapped about smoking weed in and vandalizing a room at Trump Tower — which at the time was the Trump presidential campaign headquarters:

Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week

Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed

F*ck them and f*ck y’all and f*ck me

The “King Kunta” rapper has served as a celebrity spokesman for the Obama administration’s mentoring program My Brother’s Keeper and was a frequent guest at the Obama White House.

Obama had named Lamar’s song “How Much A Dollar Cost” his favorite song of 2015 and sent a “shoutout” to the rapper congratulating him for his politically charged performance at the 58th annual Grammy Awards.

Obama also said Lamar was among his favorite rappers.

“I think the young guys, Kendrick and Chance, are doing amazing work,” Obama said last year on SiriusXM’s Sway in the Morning show.

Lamar also performed at the White House on July 4 last year for Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama’s annual military appreciation event.

WASHINGTON D.C. – Egypt’s state-owned paper Al-Ahram has announced that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will meet with President Donald Trump on April 3. The White House has confirmed that Sisi accepted the invitation Trump extended to him just days after his inauguration.

The meeting will be al-Sisi’s first visit to Washington since being elected president in 2014.

Sisi and Trump first met in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, The Guardian reported. Trump described their meeting as having “good chemistry.” Sisi, a general-turned-politician, said Trump would “without a doubt” make a strong leader.

Cairo and Washington could have a warmer relationship under Trump after years of tension between Sisi and Barack Obama and Cairo’s perception that Obama supported the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, The Guardian reported.

As defense minister, Sisi led the military’s 2013 overthrow of the Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi following massive protests against the Islamist leader.

Morsi’s removal preceded a crackdown on Islamists and secular pro-democracy activists – a crackdown that was criticized by the Obama administration and led to the suspension of some foreign aid to Sisi’s government.

Unlike Trump, Obama never invited Sisi to the White House.

Egypt and the U.S. have been close allies for most of the almost four decades since Cairo signed a peace treaty with Israel. At one point, The Guardian noted, Egypt became the second-largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel.

Sisi has made building relationships inside his country and abroad a hallmark of his tenure as president.

In February, he met with American-Jewish leaders in Cairo. Alaa Youssef, Sisi’s spokesperson, said he met with Jewish leaders to strengthen cooperation. The delegation was from the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, an umbrella organization that represents over 50 major U.S. Jewish groups.

At the meeting, Sisi discussed the war on terror, Egypt’s financial challenges, the campaign against corruption and perks for investors. Youssef said that Sisi’s American counterparts expressed appreciation of the president’s efforts on severals fronts, including the war on terror.

Sisi was criticized on Arab social media for meeting with American Jewish leaders.

“Sisi is the biggest Zionist in the Middle East,” Saleh Almansoori tweeted.

On Tuesday, Sisi took part in Egyptian Women’s Day on the occasion of Mother’s Day, the Egypt Daily News reported. “The celebration was held in one of Cairo’s hotels in the presence of high-ranking state officials and the head of the Women’s National Council.”

“Sisi’s speech included praise of Egyptian women and their struggles throughout the different historical stages in Egypt, in addition to their sacrifices in Egypt’s war against terrorism,” the Daily News reported.

“Recently, Egyptian women were on the forefront of promoting revolutions that aimed at achieving freedom and dignity and played an important role in restoring Egypt from the rule radical groups [sic] that worked hard to kidnap Egypt,” Sisi said.

“Moreover, Sisi praised Egyptian women for bearing the hardships that stemmed from the recent economic reforms and proved their efficiency in different positions, such as being parliament members, great scholars, and judges,” the Daily News reported.

Al-Sisi ended his speech by noting the instructions he issued to the government to provide state-sponsored care to children to allow Egyptian women to work outside the home, the Daily News reported.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b02efb7a6:1b29170:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump signaled he was finished with trying to repeal and replace Obamacare, telling reporters at the White House he thought the bill’s failure would produce a better bill in the future.

“We were very very close. It was a very tight margin,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after Speaker Ryan’s press conference, saying that they were probably 10-15 votes short. According to reports, over 30 representatives opposed the bill before Ryan pulled the bill at the president’s request.

Trump said that the bill’s failure would actually help Congress come up with a better plan to fix Obamacare.

“This was an interesting period of time. We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about loyalty and we learned a lot about the vote getting process,” he said.”Certainly for me it was a very interesting experience, but for me, it’ll be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan.”

Trump admitted that the bill fell short, but blamed Democrats for opposing the bill.

“The losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because they own Obamacare. They 100% own it,” Trump said. “They have Obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future.”

But Trump appeared confident that political momentum for repealing and replacing Obamacare would return, despite Republican’s failure to unite behind a solution.

“I’ve been saying for the last year and a half, that the best thing we could do, politically speaking, is let Obamacare explode,” he said. “It’s exploding right now.”

He predicted a disastrous year for Obamacare, appearing hopeful that even Democrats would back an future solution.

“We will have a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes,” he concluded.

Trump thanked his staff, Republican leadership, and even Speaker Paul Ryan for their efforts on the bill.

“I want to thank Paul Ryan who worked very, very hard,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b022e9e36:1a0b3d2:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Republican officials in Congress and the White House are now openly discussing finding a GOP replacement to Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) as Speaker of the House, after Ryan failed to pass the American Health Care Act out of the House and misled the public and President Donald Trump when he promised repeatedly the bill would pass.

Ryan was caught on an audio file from October—obtained by Breitbart News and published a couple weeks ago—saying he is “not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future.” While the audio file does not make the comments clear, Ryan’s staff later claimed that it was specifically about the Access Hollywood tape scandal from the election. The audio tape of Ryan, recorded from a House GOP members’ conference call, does not make that context clear.

Many allies of the president and several White House officials over the weeks since have confirmed to Breitbart News that the president is concerned that Ryan may not have his—or his agenda’s—best interests at heart. Ryan’s failure to deliver the votes on healthcare cement Trump’s skepticism of Ryan, they say.

“This is another example of the staff not serving the president well and the weakness of the Paul Ryan speakership,” a source close to President Trump told Breitbart News. “This calls into question once again the speaker’s commitment to supporting Donald Trump and his agenda.”

“Speaker Ryan proved today that he does not have the best interests of the President at heart,” said another source close to the president. “He sold out the president and showed his word can be taken with a grain of salt. There is only one course of action that should be taken to move past this catastrophe and that is the swift removal of Paul Ryan from the speakership.”

White House sources tell Breitbart News that the president is very frustrated with Ryan and feels that he has saved him multiple times already. After the election in November, it was widely reported that there were enough Republican votes to remove Ryan as Speaker—and the only reason conservatives kept him is that Trump won the election and embraced Ryan. But now Trump may perceive Ryan as a burden rather than someone who can help enact his agenda.

A senior Senate GOP aide questioned whether Ryan has the chops to continue in the position.

“A tale as old as time, our establishment leadership continue advocating for moderate pieces of legislation after ignoring conservative input,” the Senate aide said. “How can President Donald Trump trust Speaker Paul Ryan in the future after this failure? If he couldn’t deliver on something so simple as repealing Obamacare, will he be able to deliver on complex pieces of legislation?”

House Republicans are also questioning whether Ryan can remain as Speaker after this abysmal failure.

“If Speaker Ryan cannot pass his RyanCare plan and negotiations had to be taken to the Oval Office by non-leadership members of the conference, it is certainly time to evaluate his effectiveness as the Speaker of the House,” a senior House GOP aide told Breitbart News.

Senior aides from at least seven House GOP offices—only two from the House Freedom Caucus—tell Breitbart News that there is significant discussion conference-wide about a replacement to Ryan as Speaker of the House.

It has gotten so far along in the process that alternative names are being thrown around—anyone from House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), to former Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to House Appropriations Committee chairman Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ)—to Reps. Darrell Issa (R-CA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Peter Roskam (R-IL), according to one senior House GOP aide.

But nobody has yet emerged as an official challenger to Ryan, and it is unclear if anyone will. All of those names and more, aides say, would be more open to proactively supporting President Trump, something Ryan has repeatedly refused to do.

The fact that Frelinghuysen—a committee chairman of the powerful House panel that oversees the disbursement of government cash–came out publicly against the legislation is proof that Ryan has problems inside the House GOP conference that go much deeper than the House Freedom Caucus. It is worth noting that Frelinghuysen is a direct descendant of America’s founding fathers, and his family has served in Congress in every generation since the 1700s.

There are ongoing discussions in House offices conference-wide whether Republicans should use the same tactic that conservatives used in 2015 to remove now-former Speaker John Boehner from the House. Back then, Meadows—then just a member of the House Freedom Caucus—introduced what is called a resolution with a motion to vacate the chair. He did so just before August recess, allowing it to gain public support.

When it reached critical mass, and enough Republicans backed it publicly or privately, a group of members approached Boehner to inform him they had enough votes to remove him from the Speakership. To avoid the public embarrassment of a vote in which he would be defeated, Boehner resigned and allowed for the peaceful shift to his eventual successor, Ryan—which only happened after a tumultuous process. Members are beginning to wonder if it is now the time to use the same move on Ryan, given his disloyalty to Trump. Some Republicans want to wait for a smoke signal or sign from the White House that the president wants Ryan gone. Others want to just get it over with to help the president move on from the mess Ryan created.

Asked explicitly whether President Trump has confidence in Ryan remaining as Speaker, White House press secretary Sean Spicer would not answer Breitbart News, yes or no.

“The president believes Speaker Ryan has worked very hard to repeal and replace Obamacare and replace it with a patient centric healthcare system that lowers costs and increases choices,” Spicer said in an email on Thursday evening, not responding to follow-up emails pressing further for an explicit expression of confidence—or not—from the President in Ryan’s speakership.

But Spicer was asked if Ryan should resign if the vote fails during an interview with Fox News’s Eric Bolling, who was guest hosting on Thursday for Bill O’Reilly, and he said, “Absolutely not.”

Trump was asked in the Oval Office by reporters on Friday morning if Ryan should resign if and when the bill fails, and the President said no—for now.

“Trump said Friday at the White House that Ryan shouldn’t lose his job if the bill goes down,” Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs and Shannon Pettypiece wrote. “He also said ‘no’ when asked if the bill had been rushed or if he regretted pursuing a replacement of the Affordable Care Act ahead of other priorities such as a tax overhaul.”

After that question was asked of the President on Friday morning, Spicer was repeatedly asked the same thing Friday afternoon at his White House press briefing. Spicer referred back to the president’s comments, but added that he believes “The Speaker has done everything he can—he’s worked really closely with the president—and I think at the end of the day, I said this yesterday, you can’t force people to vote, but I think we’ve given them every single reason to fulfill every pledge that they’ve made and I think this is the right thing to do.”

Ryan’s office has not answered multiple inquiries from Breitbart News over the past several days as to whether he will resign to clear the way for President Trump’s larger agenda items.

Jacobs and Pettypiece, though, quoted a senior administration official to note that “The president’s aides are planning to blame Ryan if there is an embarrassing defeat on a bill that has been a Republican goal for more than seven years.”

The Bloomberg writers noted that when “asked whether Trump, Ryan, or the Freedom Caucus chairman, North Carolina Republican Mark Meadows, would be most to blame if the bill fails, the administration official said Ryan.”

They also quote NewsMax’s Chris Ruddy, a friend of Trump’s, who says that Ryan is not being helpful to Trump.

“I think Paul Ryan did a major disservice to President Trump. I think the president was extremely courageous in taking on health care and trusted others to come through with a program he could sign off on,” Ruddy said. “The President had confidence Paul Ryan would come up with a good plan and to me, it is disappointing.”

Bloomberg’s piece also questions the future of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, a Ryan ally who previously was Republican National Committee chairman and was also a central part of pushing this bill, alongside his longtime friend from Wisconsin.

“A Trump associate who requested anonymity to discuss the president’s views on the matter said that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus may also be imperiled,” Jacobs and Pettypiece wrote.

Bloomberg is hardly the only media outlet to question Ryan’s future.

“House Speaker Paul Ryan didn’t just step in it again, big time, on the Ryancare bill this week. The Wisconsin Republican unmasked himself as the man most capable of demolishing his own party and the Trump presidency,” the Washington Times‘ Ralph Hallow wrote late Thursday, calling Ryan’s bill “a piece of moderate GOP trash.”

Hallow wrote that Ryan’s mistakes “will make the president look foolish.”

“Nice going, Mr. Speaker,” Hallow wrote.

Trump himself, according to the Washington Post‘s Robert Costa, does not blame Ryan.

&quot;I don&apos;t blame Paul,&quot; Trump tells me — Robert Costa (@costareports) March 24, 2017

President Trump just called me. Still on phone.

&quot;We just pulled it,&quot; he tells me. — Robert Costa (@costareports) March 24, 2017

But for weeks, Ryan promised that the bill had the votes and would pass the House of Representatives without a problem. Last week, he scheduled the vote for Thursday—and guaranteed the president and the public it would pass the House on Thursday.

But that turned out to be an inaccurate and false promise from Ryan to Trump—and to the American public. Now, thanks to a last-minute push from President Trump—who is tired of negotiating—the House was scheduled to vote on Friday on the bill, despite the fact that Ryan still could not deliver the votes. But as Ryan lost significant numbers of Republicans conference-wide ahead the vote, something Ryan finally admitted to Trump at the White House earlier on Friday after misleading for weeks on the level of GOP support for the bill, the bill was pulled at the last possible minute just as the House was scheduled to vote on it.

The GOP members who were asked by Ryan’s leadership team to debate in favor of the deeply unpopular bill on the floor when Ryan knew for a fact the bill did not have the votes were like “lambs led to slaughter,” a House GOP aide told Breitbart News. Ryan will not, multiple aides from many of those offices whose members supported the bill in the floor debate tell Breitbart News, have credibility to ever ask these members to do that again.

Meanwhile, Ryan–through a variety of political action committees affiliated with his leadership PAC–has been targeting Republicans with advertisements on television and radio in their districts. The attack ads notably only hit Republicans, and not Democrats, and are something Ryan explicitly promised he would not do when he ran for Speaker in the wake of Boehner’s resignation. Boehner’s downfall was in large part due to advertisements he ran against his own members.

“This is like a general grabbing a rifle and firing shots at his own troops on base, while the enemy gets stronger outside,” a House Republican hit with Ryan’s attack ads told Breitbart News.

What is more interesting, though, is Ryan seems to have lost control of the House of Representatives. One senior House GOP aide in an office not connected to the Freedom Caucus argued that Meadows—the Freedom Caucus chairman who had been negotiating directly with President Trump in recent days—has emerged as the new House GOP leader. “Meadows is the acting Speaker of the House,” the senior GOP aide in a non-Freedom Caucus office told Breitbart News. “The president now knows on future bills that Ryan cannot deliver the votes in his own conference, and he will have to negotiate directly with the different factions of the House. Ryan has lost the ability to lead the House. He is broken.”

As Breitbart News has previously reported, members have begun discussing this bill as Ryan’s death knell—or at least the beginning of it. Ryan’s inability to maneuver the House of Representatives sufficiently to deliver on his promise to pass this bill has hampered his effectiveness and put at risk future legislation, such as tax reform, as well. Top conservative leaders are demanding that if he does stay on as Speaker—by no means a certainty—he change his ways.

Rick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, told Breitbart News:

Swampspin to the contrary, Speaker Ryan’s failure to construct an Obamacare repeal bill that respected the voters who elected a GOP House for the past four election cycles is why it failed to garner the votes needed for passage. This should be an important lesson for the Speaker who all too often has looked to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to bail him out on passing bad ideas into law. It is time that Speaker Ryan work closely with Representative Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus to pass good, limited government legislation, rather than looking longingly across the aisle for votes.

Manning also believes that now that the bill has failed, there is still an opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare with a more open and inclusive legislative process.

“Now, the House needs to get to work to construct a bill around GOP principles that can pass and be sent to the Senate so Majority Leader McConnell can move forward putting together the 51 votes needed for passage,” Manning said. “If the bills differ, there is no reason to panic as this is a return to the healthy, normal legislative process that has largely been shelved for the past few years.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b022e9e36:1a0b3d1:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Exactly two weeks ago, this author predicted the defeat of the American Health Care Act — and explained that it was a step towards the final, actual deal that will repeal and replace Obamacare.

President Donald Trump faces three irreconcilable factions: the GOP establishment, conservatives, and Democrats. He must bring them together — to “deliver the goods,” a key rule in The Art of the Deal. But first he must show them “the downside” — and convince them they will fail on their own.

The most difficult faction to deal with is the Republican establishment — not because they are politically strong, but because on policy issues like health care, they are convinced that they have all the answers and that Trump just does not understand.

So he let them make the first move — and he exposed two things about them: first, that they had not come up with a plan that was ready for prime time; second, that they had not done any of the political legwork necessary to sell their plan to voters.

Trump gave Speaker Paul Ryan and the House Republican leadership enough rope to hang themselves. Instead of dictating terms to him, they will now depend on him to save them, politically. They must accept whatever plan he will put forward.

But Trump will not make the next move. He will let the conservatives move first. They are the big winners in the first round — much more so than the Democrats, who are enjoying the spectacle of Republican dysfunction but have no role to play yet.

The conservatives will proceed with their demand for a full repeal of Obamacare. And then they will face the ire of voters who are deeply unhappy with Obamacare but upset about losing the paltry, expensive health insurance they currently have.

That, too, will strengthen Trump, and convince conservatives they need his leadership.

Whereupon Trump will turn to the moderate Democrats and offer them a deal — perhaps catastrophic health coverage in exchange for repealing Obamacare.

Democrats would take that deal because they would see a government-backed catastrophic insurance system as a possible path to the universal health care system of their dreams. Republicans would take that deal — after exhausting all of the other options — because it would leave enough room for the free market to provide insurance for most health issues, and for states to experiment with their own policies. And the more health care stakeholders who can be brought into the process, the better.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to signal optimism about the future of the House health care replacement bill despite a gloomy outlook about it’s future in Washington D.C.

“There is no question in my mind at least that the president and the team here have left everything on the field,” Spicer said during the White House press briefing on Friday.

Trump and his White House team publicly supported the bill, hosting members of congress at the White House, visiting Capitol Hill, even conducting a rally with Senate Majority Leder Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. He also held several meetings with Speaker Paul Ryan and participated on several phone calls to promote the effort.

But many Republican members of congress remained stubbornly opposed to the bill despite efforts by House Speaker Paul Ryan and House leadership to move votes in a different direction. At this point, over 30 members have signaled that they will not support the bill.

Even as Spicer was briefing the press corps, Ryan traveled to the White House to meet with Trump about the future of his signature effort. Spicer defended Ryan’s participation in the process, adding that he “has done everything he can” to sell the bill.

When asked if the president still supported Ryan as speaker, Spicer referred to an early comment the president made after the Keystone pipeline event in the Oval Office. After reporters asked the president if Ryan should remain Speaker, Trump reportedly replied “Yes,” according to a reporter in the room.

Spicer also took offense after reporters suggested the bill would fail.

“Turn on C-SPAN and we’ll watch this together,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b02130fae:19e06da:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. — At approximately the time that the U.S. House of Representatives was supposed to vote on Speaker Paul Ryan’s Obamacare replacement bill—the American Health Care Act (AHCA)—news broke that the vote had again been canceled.

Reporter Bob Costa posted news of the bill’s cancellation:

President Trump just called me. Still on phone.

&quot;We just pulled it,&quot; he tells me. — Robert Costa (@costareports) March 24, 2017

&quot;I don&apos;t blame Paul,&quot; Trump tells me — Robert Costa (@costareports) March 24, 2017

CNN reported that the bill was pulled at President Donald Trump’s request despite earlier reports that the President wanted a vote—whether or not the bill had the votes to pass. Later reports indicated it was Ryan who urged Trump that the bill needed to be pulled. It was unclear as of Friday afternoon who was ultimately responsible for the decision to pull the bill.

The vote was previously scheduled for Thursday evening, but was canceled within hours of the White House assuring that there would be a vote.

Vice President Mike Pence had canceled Friday plans to travel and promote the AHCA in two states to remain in Washington, D.C. and work with the President.

White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that if the House Leadership’s bill failed, Obamacare would remain, according to several reports.

“There were a lot of emotional pleas last night that might cause people to take off their thinking hats and react with their hearts, rather than their heads, and support what we all know is bad legislation,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said on Friday morning to SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily.

On the Friday Fox Sports 1 “Undisputed” broadcast, contributor Rob Parker weighed in on the New England Patriots players visiting the White House April 19 to celebrate their Super Bowl LI victory over the Atlanta Falcons with President Donald Trump.

Parker called for a White House “whitewash,” saying all of the black Patriots players should boycott the visit.

“I think there should be a whitewash at the White House, and I mean black players should boycott the visit,” Parker said. “When a guy shows you his cards and tells you what he thinks of you and your people and minorities in this country, take notice, because he’s telling you the truth. I think if you’re a black player and you’re going there just to take a photo op with the guy who has basically said and done the things that he’s done to this point, what would be the purpose of that?”

Parker went on to applaud 2016 Patriots defensive lineman Chris Long, a white player, for not going but said the minority players are the ones who should be boycotting the visit.

President Donald Trump has given the green light to the Keystone XL pipeline that will transport crude oil from Canadian oil-well to the refineries and ports in the United States, after then-President Barack Obama put the project on hold in 2012 to please climate change activists.

“The Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs has issued a Presidential permit to TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. (“TransCanada”) authorizing TransCanada to construct, connect, operate, and maintain pipeline facilities at the U.S.-Canadian border in Phillips County, Montana for the importation of crude oil,” a press release issued by the State Department on Friday said.

“The Department of State reviewed TransCanada’s application in accordance with Executive Order 13337 (April 30, 2004) and the January 24, 2017 Presidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline,” the announcement said. “In making his determination that issuance of this permit would serve the national interest, the Under Secretary considered a range of factors, including but not limited to foreign policy; energy security; environmental, cultural, and economic impacts; and compliance with applicable law and policy.”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former CEO at ExxonMobile, recused himself from decisions on the pipeline, so the permit was signed by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon.

“This is a significant milestone for the Keystone XL project,” Russ Girling, TransCanada’s president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.

“A significant milestone for the Keystone XL project,&quot; said Russ Girling, president &amp;CEO https://t.co/HzvLhlYtAs #TimeToBuildKXL — TransCanada (@TransCanada) March 24, 2017

“We greatly appreciate President Trump’s Administration for reviewing and approving this important initiative and we look forward to working with them as we continue to invest in and strengthen North America’s energy infrastructure,” Girling said.

On Jan. 24, Trump signed a memorandum inviting TransCanada, the company that owns the pipeline, to reapply to the U.S. State Department for approval of the project. Because the company in charge of the pipeline is not in the United States, its approval falls to the State Department.

Keystone XL is 36-inch-diameter crude oil pipeline system that will carry up to 830,000 barrels of petroleum per day from the oil sands in Canada to oil refineries and ports on the Gulf Coast of the United States.

According to the State Department’s January 2014 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, greenhouse gas emissions will actually increase without the pipeline if the crude oil from Canada is alternatively transported by rail across the U.S.

“During operation of all No Action rail scenarios, the increased number of unit trains along the scenario routes would result in GHG emissions from both diesel fuel combustion and electricity generation to support rail terminal operations (as well as for pump station operations for the Rail/Pipeline Scenario),” the FSEIS said. “The total annual GHG emissions (direct and indirect) attributed to the No Action scenarios range from 28 to 42 percent greater than for the proposed Project.”

The State Department also found that alternative energy would not replace the need for fossil fuel.

“The analysis found that even with renewable energy and conservation, there would still be a demand for oil sands-derived crude oil,” the FSEIS said. “Based on this evaluation, these alternatives were not carried forward for further analysis as alternatives to the proposed Project.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b01a4f78f:1927300:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Judge Theodore Chuang of the U.S. District Court in Maryland, who issued a temporary restraining order on March 15 halting part of President Trump’s Executive Order 13780, has scheduled a hearing on March 28 to consider the merits of a request made by the plaintiffs in their complaint to revoke the section of that exec order that limited the maximum number of refugees authorized to enter the United States in FY 2017 to 50,000.

Several legal scholars and political commentators have questioned Chuang’s impartiality, in part because he served as deputy general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, as Breitbart reported.

In the very first sentence of his March 15 decision, Chuang makes an error of fact which may indicate how he will rule on March 28.

“On March 6, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued an Executive Order which bars, with certain exceptions, the entry to the United States of nationals of six predominantly Muslim countries, suspends the entry of refugees for 120 days, and cuts by more than half the number of refugees to be admitted to the United States in the current year,” Judge Chuang writes. (emphasis added)

With this statement, Judge Chuang makes it clear that he accepts the argument made by plaintiffs HIAS (formerly Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) about refugee resettlement numbers in FY 2017. The plaintiffs argue that former President Obama’s September 22, 2016 “presidential determination” that he wanted Congress to fund the resettlement of up to 110,000 refugees in the United States in FY 2017 means that Congress must fund the resettlement of 110,000 refugees this fiscal year, and that President Trump has absolutely no say in the matter.

The facts and the law say otherwise.

In November, Donald Trump was elected president on a platform that called for a reduction in the number of refugees allowed to enter the United States, and a suspension of of refugees from Syria and other terror-prone countries into the United States, a significant event which plaintiffs HIAS and IRAP give no consideration in their complaint.

HIAS received more than $19 million in federal taxpayer funding to resettle 3,884 refugees in FY 2016, slightly more than 4 percent of the 84,995 refugees resettled in the country that year. HIAS has received a significant annual federal funding from the federal government for over three decades.

“Starting in the 2000s, HIAS expanded [its] resettlement work to include assistance to non-Jewish refugees, meaning we became involved in the aftermath of conflicts from Afghanistan, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Haiti, Hungary, Iran, Morocco, Poland, Romania, Tunisia, Vietnam, and the successor states to the former Soviet Union,” according to its website.

HIAS wants more money from the federal government in FY 2017, and claims in the complaint that it was promised that money by the Department of State.

“After the January 27 Order was issued, the U.S. State Department notified HIAS that its resettlement obligation for FFY 2017 would be slashed from nearly 4,800 to just over 2900 refugees. The financial losses to HIAS and its affiliate network—up to $2.2 million—will be crippling, especially for many of HIAS’s affiliates, which are heavily dependent on funding that flows through HIAS,” the complaint reads.

IRAP “organizes law students and lawyers to develop and enforce a set of legal and human rights for refugees and displaced persons,” and is funded by Fortune 500 companies, including 3M, General Electric, JP Morgan Chase, and Microsoft, and several dozen top level international law firms, including Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, Goodwin Proctor, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, &amp; Garrison, Skadden Arps, and Ropes &amp; Gray.

The argument advanced by plaintiffs HIAS (formerly Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), that asked Judge Chuang to tell both the President and Congress they must allow 110,000 refugees into the United States in FY 2017 is both unusual and misleading.

Judge Chuang, for unknown reasons, chose not to rule on this specific request from the plaintiffs as part of his March 15 decision.

The other federal judge who issued a similar ruling, also on March 15, Derrick Watson in Hawaii, specifically addressed the refugee limitation component of Executive Order 13780, and overruled it on grounds that were entirely political, and are likely to be reversed on appeal.

“Pursuant to the President’s congressionally delegated authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f), the Executive Order purports to limit the number of refugees who may be admitted in fiscal year 2017 to 50,000, despite an earlier proclamation setting a limit of 110,000, in violation of the Refugee Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1157(a)(2),” the plaintiffs requested in the prayer for relief section of the complaint filed on March 10, four days after President Trump signed Executive Order 13780.

Plaintiffs HIAS and IRAP are arguing that Trump’s executive order limitation of refugees to 50,000 in FY 2017 was “pursuant to the President’s congressionally delegated authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f),” which reads as follows:

Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in any fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 shall be such number as the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation, is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest. (emphasis added)

HIAS and IRAP fail to acknowledge in their complaint that the “earlier proclamation setting a limit of 110,000” refugees to be resettled in the United States in FY 2017 was not a Constitutionally authorized executive order, or even a “proclamation,” but instead was the statutory “presidential determination” for FY 2017 made by former President Obama on September 22, 2016.

Under the statute, the Refugee Act of 1980, such a “presidential determination” of maximum refugee resettlements must be made prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year (in this case October 1, 2016, the beginning of FY 2017) and merely sets a top limit of refugees authorized but not funded for the coming year.

Congress actually sets the funding level for the number of refugees to be resettled when it passes a budget for a fiscal year.

“The statutory consultation provision with regard to refugee admissions was the result of a compromise reached between the State Department and Congress and addressed to levels of consultation – one that would be part of the president’s annual determination of refugee admissions and another, that would be required in the event of an ’emergency refugee situation,’ ” an attorney familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News.

“In both instances as part of the consultation, the statute requires the cost estimate of moving and resettling these refugee admissions. There is nothing in the statute that requires consultation should the refugee admission numbers proposed in the annual determination, be decreased. In fact, the annual determination number is a proposed ceiling that hasn’t always been reached in prior fiscal years and for that matter,” the attorney adds.

“While the Refugee Act did not include a legislative veto with regard to the president’s annual determination of refugee admissions, neither did it cede any of its appropriations authority that could impact refugee admissions. Nor did Congress in passing the Refugee Act, in any way either explicitly or implicitly, constrain the authority delegated to the president by Congress under 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) to restrict the entry of any aliens, refugee or otherwise, if in his judgment, it is ‘detrimental to the interests of the United States,’ ” the attorney concludes.

In FY 2016, President Obama set a presidential determination of 85,000 refugees, and Congress agreed with that number, funding the settlement of 84,995 refugees in the FY 2016, the actual number of refugees that were resettled in the United States between October 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016.

But FY 2017 has been a different matter entirely.

After President Obama made a “presidential determination” of 110,000 refugees to be resettled in FY 2017, an increase of 29 percent from the FY 2016 level, Congress was unable to agree upon a FY 2017 budget. Instead, in October it passed a 10 week continuing resolution that funded everything in FY 2017 – including refugee resettlement – at the same level that it was funded in FY 2016. In the case of refugee resettlement, that meant refugee resettlement was funded during those 10 weeks at an annual rate of 85,000 refugees, or roughly 16,000 refugees between October 1, 2016 and December 9, 2016.

On December 10, 2016, Congress passed an additional continuing resolution that extended FY 2016 funding levels for FY 2017 until April 28, 2017. That funding applies to the refugee resettlement program, as well as most other federal programs.

Beyond April 28, there are currently no funds appropriated to resettle refugees in the United States for the balance of FY 2017. Congress may change that between now and April 28, but

The actual number of refugees resettled in the United States during the first 3 months and 21 days of FY 2017 between October 1, 2016 and January 21, 2017, the last day of the Obama administration, was 30,132, according to the Department of State interactive website, a rate that if continued through the entire fiscal year would result in a total of about 97,200 refugees resettled in the United States by September 30, 2017, the end of FY 2017.

Congress, however, has, of now, only appropriated funding sufficient to resettle 48,901 refugees in the United States in FY 2017, which is 1,099 below the limit of 50,000 President Trump established in Executive Order 13780.

Officials at the Department of State as well as all the refugee resettlement agencies–including HIAS–are well aware that their funding for FY 2017 is about to run out, and that circumstance is entirely unrelated at this time to President Obama’s September 22 “presidential determination” that set the maximum limit of refugees authorized to resettle in the United States in FY 2017 at 110,000.

As of March 23, 38,453 refugees have been resettled in the country, so under current budget appropriations, there is money to resettle only an additional 10,448 refugees in the country for the balance of FY 2017.

“Because HIAS is a non-profit resettlement organization that has a cooperative agreement with the federal government on a per-capita basis for each refugee served, and because the Department of State asked HIAS to increase its capacity from the 3,884 refugees resettled in federal fiscal year (“FFY”) 2016 to 4,794 refugees in FFY 2017, HIAS would be denied crucial funding as a result of the March 6 Order, which bans all refugees for 120 days, bars all entry for the six Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, and limits the number of refugees to be admitted in the current fiscal year at 50,000, which is less than half the number the Department of State told the resettlement agencies to collectively plan to resettle,” the complaint continues. (emphasis added)

“HIAS is a plaintiff in at least one of the lawsuits against the Trump Administration and I thought it might be a good idea to show you their complaints which seem to center around the idea that they were promised so many refugees (paying clients) this fiscal year and now they might not get them,” Ann Corcoran at Refugee Resettlement Watch says.

“Can you sue the federal government to get grants you were hoping for?” she asks.

“Shouldn’t there be a federal law disallowing non-profits receiving federal grants from working against the hand that feeds them?” Corcoran wonders.

“In FY 2015, the State Department, through the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, spent more than $1 billion on these programs, which settled international refugees “vetted” by the United Nations High Commission on International Refugees in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The federal government spent hundreds of millions of dollars more than that on refugees, however. The Department of Health and Human Services also provided a number of “entitlements” to these refugees,” Breitbart News reported in 2015:

Much of this $1 billion in annual revenue goes to voluntary agencies (VOLAGs), several of which are Christian non-profits, such as Catholic Charities, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, World Relief Corporation, Church World Service, and Domestic and Foreign Missionary Service of the Episcopal Church of the USA. (also referred to as Episcopal Migration Ministries), who are contracted on behalf of the government to help these refugees get settled in their new homes in America. Five of the top nine VOLAGs are Christian non-profits. The other four are Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), International Rescue Committee, US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, and the Ethiopian Community Development Council.

The HIAS/IRAP complaint on which Judge Chuang will hold a hearing on March 28 is all about continuing the flow of federal funds to these VOLAGs who are almost completely reliant on the taxpayers to pay for their operations, and their salaries.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b01896ee7:16ba2e2:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

TEL AVIV — Eastern European leaders have “drawn inspiration” from conservative U.S. media outlets, especially Breitbart News, to crack down on groups financed by billionaire George Soros that are allegedly attempting to meddle in domestic politics, Reuters reported.

The news agency reported on Thursday:

The campaign against Soros in countries formerly dominated by Moscow appears to follow a template set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose own crackdown on foreign-funded charities drove Soros’s foundation out of Russia two years ago.

And now, with President Donald Trump in the White House, anti-Soros campaigners in Eastern Europe say they have also drawn inspiration from the United States, particularly from rightwing U.S. media like the website Breitbart, which has long vilified Soros as a liberal hate figure.

Breitbart’s former chairman Steve Bannon now serves as a senior White House adviser to Trump.

“Our inspiration comes from the United States, from the American conservative organizations, media and congressmen with the same views, especially the new administration of President Trump,” said Cvetlin Cilimanov, the editor of the main state news agency in Macedonia, who co-founded a group called Operation Stop Soros in January.

Reuters quoted anti-Soros campaigners in Macedonia, Romania, and Hungary accusing Soros of using his Open Society Foundations to create a vast web of front groups that push a globalist agenda.

The news agency cited Szilard Nemeth, a deputy leader of Hungarian Prime Minister Vikto Orban’s ruling Fidesz party, as saying in January that “fake NGOs of the Soros empire are sustained to suppress national governments in favor of global capital and the world of political correctness.”

“These organizations must be repressed by all means and I think they must be culled altogether,” Nemeth said. “I think there is an international opportunity to do that now.”

As Reuters reported, Orban himself on Friday blamed Soros-funded groups for his government’s loss last week of a lawsuit in the European Court of Human Rights over the expulsion of two migrants who came to the country from Bangladesh.

“It is a collusion of human traffickers, Brussels bureaucrats and the organizations that work in Hungary financed by foreign money,” Orban stated last Friday on public radio.

“Let’s call a spade a spade: George Soros finances them.”

The Reuters article marks the second time in recent weeks that Breitbart News was singled out in the major news media for its influential reporting on Soros.

Earlier this month, Politico reported investigations by Breitbart News into the global network run by Soros have contributed to the negative atmosphere the billionaire has been facing in Europe.

The Hungarian parliament has plans to submit a bill on the manner in which foreign-funded non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, operate within the country. Although the text of the proposed law has not yet been made public, it is widely believed that the bill will seek to require such organizations to make public the amount of money received from foreign sources. Israel passed a similar measure last July.

Breitbart News has featured a large number of stories documenting Soros’s financing of groups pushing open borders in Europe and worldwide, with specific focus on the use of the migrant crisis to achieve policy aims.

In the U.S., Soros has been tied to advocacy for illegal aliens, opposition to immigration enforcement, and, most recently, to activist groups attempting to halt President Trump’s domestic agenda.

Reviews by this reporter of the more than 2,500 documents hacked from the servers of Soros’s Open Society Foundations highlight the undue influence the billionaire financier exerts domestically, from attempting to remake the American electorate to successfully lobbying for changes in U.S. immigration policy to funding initiatives targeting local police forces.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Vice President Mike Pence opted to stay in Washington, D.C. on Friday, putting aside prior travel plans to promote House Speaker Paul Ryan’s health care bill after a planned Thursday vote on the legislation was canceled.

Butler Coach Chris Holtmann mentioned as recently as Thursday afternoon that Pence was going to the team’s Sweet 16 game against North Carolina, according to Fox59. Midday Friday Pence’s office confirmed that the Vice President would not be in attendance.

The Vice President had also been scheduled for trips to Little Rock, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee Friday. However, a senior administration official told Breitbart News, “The Vice President is postponing his trip to Little Rock and Memphis to remain in Washington to work with President Trump as the House of Representatives considers the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.”

A vote on the House Republican Leadership’s Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA,) was scheduled on Thursday night but was canceled in the midst of reports that there weren’t enough “yes” votes to pass the bill.

The White House now says the vote is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET Friday.

Speaker Paul Ryan traveled to the White House midday Friday to meet with the President.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow of Breitbart News Daily on Friday morning that he expects a vote on the House Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the same day. Brooks is opposed to the bill.

“I do not control the voting process. That’s done by [Speaker of the House Paul Ryan], and he can always change his mind,” Rep. Brooks noted. “But as of last night, we’re voting today.”

He said he was uncertain if estimates that the bill does not have enough votes to pass are still valid.

“There were a lot of emotional pleas last night that might cause people to take off their thinking hats and react with their hearts, rather than their heads, and support what we all know is bad legislation,” he said.

“First, I believe it is a horrible replacement bill,” Brooks declared, when Marlow asked why so many Republicans support a bill that seems to fall far short of GOP promises to repeal Obamacare.

“Second, in my judgment, the reason is there are a lot of Republican politicians who, back home, wanted to pretend that they were in favor of Obamacare repeal in order to win their primaries, when, in fact, they weren’t,” he contended. “And now we’re to the stage where votes count. If we can get bills to the president’s desk, there’s a good chance that they will be signed. We are suddenly finding that a lot of Republican congressmen, maybe they weren’t really for repeal of Obamacare in the first place.”

“That’s why we have a bill that is referred to as ‘Obamacare-Lite’ or ‘Obamacare 2.0’ – because it does not repeal Obamacare,” he explained. “In fact, it keeps the substantive parts of Obamacare that have caused premiums to skyrocket, which is why the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation are warning us in Congress that health insurance premiums over the next two years will go up 15 to 20 percent, rather than drop like you would have happen if there was an Obamacare repeal.”

Brooks said he had two major reasons for believing the House bill is a bad piece of legislation.

“One is we were sent to Washington, D.C., to help struggling American families with healthcare costs, not pass legislation that’s going to continue to increase the cost of health care, which is what this bill does,” he said.

“What we should be doing is implementing cost containment measures,” Brooks argued. “We should be repealing the parts of Obamacare that have forced these skyrocketing premiums on struggling American families, rather than keep them in this new bill.”

“In addition to that, we should interject new provisions that will force competition into the marketplace,” he continued. “By way of example, we should be forcing interstate health insurance competition that, in turn, will force lower insurance prices, as health insurance companies from around the country compete for a customer base. We should be repealing antitrust exemptions that suppress competition, that create oligopolies and monopolies that, in turn, drive up healthcare costs.”

“Those are the kinds of things we should be doing on the cost containment side so that premiums will not go up that estimated 15 to 20 percent, as is represented to us by both the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. As an aside, I’ve heard no argument to the contrary – much less no persuasive argument to the contrary,” he said.

“The second reason may even be bigger than the first, and that is that Obamacare 2.0 is the largest Republican welfare program in the history of the Republican Party. That has a lot of implications, cascading effects,” Brooks warned.

“By way of example, it undermines the work ethic. It encourages more and more Americans to live off the hard work of others. Obamacare 2.0, because of this welfare provision over time, is going to dramatically increase the need to raise taxes or borrow more money to pay for, if past experiences are any indication, what will be escalating welfare costs. As you know, struggling American families cannot afford more taxes, and America cannot afford more debt. It’s already at $20 trillion. We’re already being warned that we’re heading into insolvency and bankruptcy. We need to heed those warnings, rather than destroy what it took more than two centuries of American ancestors to build.”

“In addition to that, there’s a huge political ramification, and you see it a little bit in the debate that we’ve had so far. By way of example, if this bill passes with this huge welfare program, all of a sudden, you are converting tens of millions of voters who now are self-reliant into welfare dependents – thus making elections about who can deliver the most welfare for me to help me with my health insurance premium,” he said.

“That’s going to have a huge electoral impact. That’s going to turn America over to the Bernie Sanders socialist wing of American society. Quite frankly, it may be the death knell for the free enterprise system that has helped make America the greatest economic power in the world,” he warned.

Brooks offered an example of how the political dynamics of the House Republican bill were making the welfare-state problem worse, even before the bill is voted upon.

“Obamacare 2.0, this Republican welfare program, was introduced about two weeks ago,” he said. “The Congressional Budget Office, on March the 13, did an analysis of that bill as it was two weeks ago. Two weeks later, the Congressional Budget Office on March 23 did another analysis of what purports to be the amended version of Obamacare. Over that two-week period, the financial projections worsened by $187 billion, as congressional politicians scrambled to promise more and more welfare to placate merely feared demands of these projected welfare recipients. So just the mere fear of future demands for welfare caused this House of Representatives to worsen our financial condition by $187 billion in just two weeks, in this legislation.”

“We’re not doing what we were sent here to do: cut premium costs, make health care more affordable on the one hand, and on the other hand, to create a huge new welfare program that, in effect, duplicates the structure of Obamacare,” he lamented. “That’s not what the Alabama voters sent me to Washington, D.C., to do, and I’m very much puzzled by those other congressman who think that’s a good thing.”

Brooks predicted that “if people think with their heads,” the bill will “go down into a crashing defeat.”

“If they think with their hearts, then it has a reasonable chance of passing,” he added. “There is tremendous pressure, particularly amongst Republican friends in the House and Senate and the White House, to pass this legislation because of our friendship, as opposed to whether it’s good or bad for America.”

Marlow noted that the bill is “overwhelmingly unpopular” with voters, scoring as low as 17 percent support in polls, but seems to enjoy vastly disproportionate support from the House Republican caucus.

“It has very little to do with what America wants outside the Beltway and a lot to do with what inside-the-Beltway America – and, in particular, special interest groups and lobbyists – want,” Brooks replied.

“From my perspective, it’s the worst I’ve ever faced, and I’ve been in public life for three decades,” he said, when Marlow professed to have heard few cogent defenses of the bill.

Brooks had little use for the argument that this legislation was just step one in a three-part or “three-pronged” plan to repeal Obamacare. The White House description of this strategy describes step two as relief from burdensome regulations, and step three as “additional legislation,” such as permitting health care to be sold across state lines and reforming malpractice insurance.

“I agree with the argument of those in the Senate who have called part three the ‘sucker bucket,’” he said. “And part two is subject to litigation that will tie it in knots for who knows how many years. If it’s good, why not put it in this legislation? If we’re really going to do it, why not put it in this legislation and force it through the House, and force it through the Senate, if it’s good and if it’s going to happen.”

“Two and three – two might happen to some degree, although who knows how many years it will take for it to get through all the litigation aspects? Number three, never happen,” he predicted.

Marlow cited the argument that defeat for the House Obamacare bill will hinder Republicans in their mission to “stop the Democratic Party” and its agenda.

“Stopping the Democrats is meaningless if we’re not, at the same time, doing the right thing for our country,” Brooks declared.

“I don’t believe this impacts President Trump’s reputation so much as it impacts those who have given the president bad advice and put him in this position,” he added.

“The simplest and smartest thing to do would have been to pull up the Obamacare repeal bill that passed the Republican House and passed the Republican Senate two years ago that was vetoed by President Obama,” he said. “Pass that through the House. Pass that through the Senate. Have whatever effective date you want in the future to implement the free-enterprise market principles that we want to force competition into the marketplace.”

“We had legislation that we voted on in the past that got unanimous support of Republicans in the House, unanimous support of Republicans in the Senate. It even complied with those arcane, crazy Senate rules that frustrate America in so many different ways, and it made it to the president’s desk,” Brooks pointed out. “It baffles me that that was not done, although it doesn’t really baffle me once you start thinking about all these Republican politicians who wanted to go back home saying, giving the impression, that they’re for repeal of Obamacare when they really aren’t.”

Marlow noted that President Trump has essentially said the current House GOP bill is the only repeal and replace option that will be on the table for the near future and voting it down will leave Obamacare in place for a long time to come. He asked Brooks if this was a “threat” to recalcitrant lawmakers or, at least, a dramatic “ratcheting up of the rhetoric.”

“I would call it a bargaining tool or a tactic,” Brooks replied. “I am mildly surprised, but not too much. It seems consistent with the bargaining tactics that the president talks about in The Art of the Deal. I would hope that whoever is advising the president would not advise him to surrender on an issue of this magnitude. America deserves better.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a stunning rebuke to House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Appropriations Committee chairman Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) announced his public opposition to Obamacare 2.0 on Friday morning.

“Seven years after enactment of Obamacare, I wanted to support legislation that made positive changes to rescue healthcare in America,” Frelinhguysen, who has been lauded as the Garden State’s most powerful congressman, wrote in a Facebook post.

Unfortunately, the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey. In addition to the loss of Medicaid coverage for so many people in my Medicaid-dependent state, the denial of essential health benefits in the individual market raise serious coverage and cost issues. I remain hopeful that the American Health Care Act will be further modified. We need to get this right for all Americans.

The House Speaker almost never loses the Appropriations Chairman on major pieces of legislation. The fact Frelinghuysen is against the bill calls into question Ryan’s ability to lead the conference–including his own committee chairs–in the future on other pieces of legislation. It shows just how unpopular this legislation really is GOP-wide, and further demonstrates Ryan’s inability to bring together the different factions of the House Republican conference.

Many more Republicans are expected to vote against Speaker Ryan’s bill, the American Health Care Act–or “Obamacare 2.0” or “Obamacare Lite” or “RyanCare” or “RINO-care”—as it has become known. Other Republicans who are expected to vote against the revised version of the Affordable Healthcare Act include Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV), Rep. Tom Budd (R-NC), Rep. David Brat (R-VA), Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Rep. Mo Brooks (R-SC), and Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX). Now that Ryan has lost Frelinghuysen–the chairman of a powerful committee that controls government spending–it is highly unlikely Ryan will be able to deliver the votes on this. That means Ryan is delivering a loss to President Trump, after failing to control his members.

President Donald Trump singled out members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus for refusing to support Paul Ryan’s bill to replace Obamacare.

“The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows [Planned Parenthood] to continue if they stop this plan!” Trump wrote on Twitter Friday morning.

The House-led effort would defund Planned Parenthood, although that part of the bill faces a tough hurdle in the Senate. Pro-choice Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have signaled their opposition to that part of the bill.

Thursday night, senior White House aides delivered a message to House Republicans from the president: pass the bill on Friday, or leave Obamacare in place.

On Friday, Trump tried to rally support through Twitter.

“After seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums &amp; deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan!” Trump wrote.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b011b2def:1609070:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The chairman of the House Freedom Caucus (HFC) spoke to Breitbart News on Thursday after his meeting with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and three senior aides to President Trump. The topic was the final attempt to modify the American Health Care Act before the House vote on Friday.

“The principles of a deal have been defined – an agreement? The details of the agreement are the most fundamental question, and that is what we are working on,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who met with Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s chief strategist; Reince Priebus, his chief of staff; and Mick Mulvaney, his budget director.

Meadows said the House Freedom Caucus welcomed the compromise from the president that the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) provision in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will be stripped away.

Removal of the EHB does not cover sufferers, he said. “Instead of four or five plans, you can have 10 or 20.” The EHB forced a 60-year-old man to pay for maternity coverage, among other things, because it was part of the required benefits every plan had to provide.

Other issues are the series of mandates and rules that hinder the way an insurance company manages risk or just runs its business, such as the requirement that companies must spend at least 80 percent of their premium revenues on health care or the rule that restricts companies from charging older customers more than three times what they charge their youngest customers.

“Without getting into the details of what we are negotiating, we’re trying to make sure the high-risk pools are really very functional and provide a way for some of those more expensive healthcare issues to be handled on a state basis with their private insurers,” he said.

Meadows was joined by fellow HFC member Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) on Fox News Wednesday night, where the two men told host Sean Hannity that the House Freedom Caucus reached a deal with Trump. Somehow, that momentum coming out of Wednesday night stalled.

“I think we hit some bumps as it related to the type of policies and the details about those policies,” Meadows said. “The belief was that that would attract enough votes.”

A Capitol Hill source told Breitbart News that at the 7 p.m. meeting of the House Republican Conference, the speaker saluted Meadows and the House Freedom Caucus for improving the American Health Care Act.

The speaker told his members he expects every Republican to support the bill because it does as much as can be done.

The congressman said his bloc of House conservatives is still enough to keep Ryan from reaching 216 votes from the 237 GOP congressmen. There is no expectation of picking up any of the 193 House Democrats. “I think there are a few people who have moved into undecided or yes but not a substantial number yet,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b011b2def:160906f:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

NEW YORK (AP) — For years, family members of those killed on Sept. 11 and insurance companies tried unsuccessfully through the courts to hold Saudi Arabia or businesses and organizations there responsible for the terrorist attacks. Now that Congress has cleared the way, they’re making a fresh effort.

In the next year, the Manhattan federal courts will make rulings signaling to thousands of family members of those killed and injured first responders whether passage of the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act was largely a symbolic exercise or a catalyst to getting them to trial.

Timothy Litzenburg, a Richmond, Virginia, lawyer, said his firm raced to court hours after Congress overrode former President Barack Obama’s veto in late September, hoping to get an early start on winning damages for litigants.

“We thought maybe we could do the first trial,” he said. But now that the lawsuits have been consolidated before a New York federal court, Litzenburg predicts it could be a decade before there is a resolution for over a dozen lawsuits filed against the kingdom.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn tried to put the litigation on a faster track Thursday, telling dozens of lawyers at a Manhattan conference that she believes some of the lawsuits can be combined because they make identical or similar claims. She noted the latest lawsuit had been filed just hours earlier.

James Kreindler, a plaintiffs’ lawyer in one new lawsuit, told her he expects the lawsuits may be combined into two legal actions, perhaps within a month.

Michael Kellogg, a lawyer for Saudi Arabia, said at Thursday’s hearing that lawyers for plaintiffs were unfairly using mostly the same plaintiffs in 9/11 cases brought 14 years ago to make new claims against Saudi Arabia.

“They’ve added a number of different allegations, which will complicate the process,” he said.

Saudi Arabia, an important U.S. ally in the Middle East, had lobbied against the new law.

President Donald Trump had called Obama’s veto “shameful.” Obama said he rejected it because it could open up the U.S. government to lawsuits around the world claiming that the United States has supported terrorism.

Sovereign immunity usually protects governments from lawsuits, but the bill creates an exception that lets litigants hold foreign governments responsible if they support a terrorist attack that kills U.S. citizens on American soil.

Previous efforts to hold Saudi Arabia, its officials, and banks and charitable organizations responsible for the attacks have failed in the courts. Not all of the cases have been tossed out solely for sovereign immunity reasons.

In 2008, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that four Saudi princes cannot be held liable in the Sept. 11 attacks even if they were aware that charitable donations to Muslim groups would be funneled to al-Qaida.

The court said the plaintiffs would need to prove the princes engaged in intentional actions aimed at U.S. residents.

A lower court judge had earlier cited the Sept. 11 commission, saying it found no evidence Saudi Arabia — the birthplace of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers — funded or supported the Sept. 11 terrorists.

Saudi lawyers have not responded to requests to comment on the new lawsuits. In the past, they’ve said in court papers that families are relying on the submission of “thousands of pages of inadmissible and irrelevant materials.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b00ff98d3:17d179c:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Supporters of President Donald Trump disrupted a town hall held by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in the Inland Empire town of Ontario on Thursday evening, the San Bernardino Sun reports.

Becerra has led California’s charge against many of President Trump’s policies. Earlier this week, for example, he filed a brief supporting a lawsuit by Santa Clara County challenging the president’s executive order that threatens sanctuary cities with the loss of federal funding.

An earlier town hall at the San Bernardino Valley College had proceeded without incident, the Sun reports. However, in Ontario, Becerra faced a hostile audience:

Before Becerra could begin, a group of Trump supporters stormed the meeting at Chaffey High, chanting, “Shame on you.” A webpage advertising the protest called out Becerra for not supporting President Donald Trump’s immigration initiatives. Doors opened at 5:30 p.m. in Ontario, and Trump supporters carrying signs with the president’s name and saying “America first,” stormed the room. While the town hall kicked off on time at 6 p.m., the protesters continued to interrupt the proceedings. Becerra was introduced to simultaneous cheers and boos. … Just before 6:45 p.m., the event came to a halt. The protesters continued to chant and audience members exited.

Until now, most of the disruptions at town hall meetings this year have been carried out by opponents of President Trump against members of Congress, usually Republicans.

Last month, for example, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) left a town hall under police escort due to aggressive disruptions by anti-Trump activists.

The left-wing movement calling itself the “Resistance” or “Indivisible” has shared its disruption tactics widely through online manuals and other media.

Becerra, who dared the Trump administration to “come at us” in December, and predicted a “legal war” with Trump in January, found himself on the receiving end of the left’s own tactics on Thursday.

It was the latest example of the rise in passions — and decline in civility — on both sides of the growing political divide.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15b00c87a93:1770aa1:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Labor, Alexander Acosta, said during a congressional hearing that he believed it is “not the intent” to replace American employees with cheaper, foreign ones under the H-1B visa program.

During a Senate hearing, Acosta said he did not believe the H-1B visa was intended to be used by big businesses to replace American personnel.

“Some Americans have seen jobs go overseas. Some Americans have seen jobs filled by foreign workers,” Acosta said, according to the Times of India. “Indeed, I’ve read reports that some Americans have been asked to train their foreign replacements.”

“And some Americans see that jobs are available, but these available jobs require skills that they do not have,” Acosta continued.

“Particularly, when, in those circumstances that I highlighted where Americans are being asked to train their foreign replacements,” Acosta said. “That is not the intent of the H-1B.”

Acosta did seem to be unaware of the massive problem that the H-1B visa has caused for American labor, particularly tech and former Disney employees who were forced to train their replacements before being fired.

“So one question that I would have is, how often is that happening,” Acosta asked. “Is that something that we should be looking at with greater degree of care? I think we also need to work with, public-private partnerships. I know that there is a lot of discussion about an infrastructure program. An infrastructure program will certainly bring back a lot of jobs.”

Director of the Center for Immigration Studies Mark Krikorian said he found it astonishing that Acosta did not seem to know of the H-1B visa’s impact on American labor.

“How could he not be aware of it? It’s all over the news,” Krikorian told Breitbart Texas. “Trump brought it up.”

“This is one of the high-profile labor issues,” Krikorian said. “Him saying that is kind of like saying he’s unfamiliar with the $15 minimum wage.”

Krikorian said Acosta’s comments on H-1B did not surprise him, telling Breitbart Texas “that’s what all the politicians who created the problem say, too.”

Acosta has been criticized in the past, as Breitbart News reported, for supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants and continued inflows of cheaper, foreign workers instead of big businesses hiring American workers.

In 2012, during a campaign event for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Acosta demanded that illegal immigrants be given a “pathway to legal immigration,” saying they were needed in the U.S. to fill jobs in the construction and agricultural sectors.

“Puzder does seem to be worse,” Krikorian said. “He was doing stuff to replace Americans with foreigners.”

While Congress must ultimately be the ones to lower the cap of the some 85,000 H-1B visas that are allotted to foreign workers every year, Krikorian said there are steps that the Trump Administration can take to reform the program.

For instance, Trump could demand that H-1B visas are allotted based on the highest salaries offered by companies looking for foreign help.

There does not appear to be any reforms this year for the H-1B visa.

As Breitbart Texas reported, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said that reforming the H-1B is not an immediate priority for the Trump Administration.

Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” conservative commentator Ann Coulter, author of “In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” echoed her call urging President Donald Trump to get back on track on fulfilling his campaign promises and spend less time on “Paul Ryan’s priorities.”

“They seem to be Paul Ryan’s priorities, and also just the standard GOP corporatist stuff,” Coulter said. “What made Donald Trump stand apart from the crowd and apart from the crowd from every presidential candidate for 20 years was immigration, trade, infrastructure, building a wall. Obviously, that was very, very popular. A lot of people listen to all this time. Look, I like tax cuts. I’d love to have my taxes cut — 50 percent of people don’t even pay taxes. I think the bigger problem now is jobs. And I will not hold the emperor god responsible for this Obamacare-lite bill, but, oh for Pete’s sake. Am I the last person in America who understands the free market?”

“Sean Spicer was very good today explaining to idiot reporters, getting mandated coverage doesn’t mean insurance companies won’t cover it. It means Ann won’t be required to pay for 15 services more like 50 services that I have no interest in,” she continued.

“They’re all talking about Congress is going to give us these things. Congress can give us nothing. The free market can give us things. And they are coming up with the premiums? Who would be better to come up with the premiums — someone whose business it is that needs to come up with a good premium to compete to get my business, and who has disease specialists and actuarial specialists or politicians in Washington?”

By law, any information inadvertently collected about Americans — such as phone calls or emails — is supposed to be “masked” by privacy regulations, and is also kept secret from the public by need-to-know classification rules.

According to Fox:

Classified intelligence showing incidental collection of Trump team communications, purportedly seen by [intelligence] committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and described by him in vague terms at a bombshell Wednesday afternoon news conference, came from multiple sources, Capitol Hill sources told Fox News. The intelligence corroborated information about surveillance of the Trump team that was known to Nunes, sources said, even before President Trump accused his predecessor of having wiretapped him in a series of now-infamous tweets posted on March 4.

The intelligence is said to leave no doubt the Obama administration, in its closing days, was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on President-elect Trump, according to sources.

The key to that conclusion is the unmasking of selected U.S. persons whose names appeared in the intelligence, the sources said, adding that the paper trail leaves no other plausible purpose for the unmasking other than to damage the incoming Trump administration.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afe6a08fc:13ae3b4:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Climate Change is more real, and dangerous, and worrying than ever before because lots of bad weather has happened around the world.

Now that I have handily summarised the World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) latest report — WMO Statement on the State of Global Climate in 2016 — you have no need to read it.

That’s because the report’s only intended function is as a propaganda device to prop up the global climate alarmist narrative.

You can tell this because of certain key phrases that have been embedded in the “Executive Summary.”

Phrases like:

Warming continued in 2016, setting a new temperature record of approximately 1.1 °C above the pre-industrial period… …against a background of long-term climate change…. Severe droughts affected agriculture and yield production in many parts of the world, particularly in southern and eastern Africa and parts of Central America, where several million people experienced food insecurity and hundreds of thousands were displaced internally… Detection and attribution studies have demonstrated that human influence on the climate has been a main driver behind the unequivocal warming of the global climate system… Human influence has also led to significant regional temperature increases at the continental and subcontinental levels. Shifts of the temperature distribution to warmer regimes are expected to bring about increases in the frequency and intensity of extremely warm events.

But most of this stuff just comes from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, which was published in 2014. What, exactly, is its relevance to a new report on last year’s weather?

Short answer: none — but this was never the point.

The point is that the World Meteorological Organization has long been one of the chief promoters of the great global warming scare. The WMO was one of the two United Nations organizations — the other was the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) – which set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC exists on the unquestioned assumption that man-made climate change is a serious problem. Its only purposes are to find more evidence for the problem’s existence and to propose various solutions for how to deal with it. At no stage, ever, can the IPCC admit to there not being a man-made climate change problem because that would mean doing itself out of business.

The WMO and its various UN sidekicks, in other words, represent the belly of the beast of the Climate Industrial Complex.

This is the rampaging monster against which President Trump has heroically pitted himself on his holy mission to slay the Green Blob.

It will not be an easy task — and it might even be a hopeless one for the Green Blob has many tentacles.

One of them is this rather noisome organisation, the Science Media Centre, which reports to be a neutral charity providing dispassionate information about science but, in fact, works as a tireless disseminator of green propaganda. In order to big up the WMO report, it has lined up various members of the usual suspects from the world of climate alarmism to testify about how amazingly important it is — and to dutifully confirm that, yes, global warming is, like, even worse than ever.

Why, here is Prof. Martin Siegert of the Grantham Institute, funded by climate alarmist hedge funder Jeremy Grantham, to promote the cause of climate alarmism:

The announcement from WMO is shocking but sadly unsurprising… We simply cannot say we haven’t been warned, however. The problem is ours to fix and we must do so right now. The longer we wait for effective action the harder and more costly it will be.

Well, whoulda thunk, eh?

And here is the photogenic Dr. Emily Shuckburgh of the British Antarctic Survey:

The changes we are now seeing in the polar regions are a stark reminder of the scale and urgency of the climate challenge.

Of course they are, Emily. Of course. And you didn’t even need to use the phrase, “By the way, please can we have lots more grant funding?”

And here’s Dr. Phil Williamson, speaking from the home of the Climategate scandal, the University of East Anglia:

Human-driven climate change is now an empirically-verifiable fact, combining year-to-year variability with the consequences of our release of extra greenhouse gases. Those who dispute that link are not sceptics, but anti-science deniers.

Surely this can’t be the same Dr. Phil Williamson whose complaint was humiliatingly rejected when he reported your humble correspondent to IPSO because he objected to a few pieces I’d written explaining why Ocean Acidification was basically just another junk science scare intended to prop up the alarmist anti-CO2 narrative? Why yes. Exactly that Dr. Phil Williamson.

Truly these people have no shame. And they can go on and on spouting all this nonsense because the braindead liberal media is more than happy to regurgitate it. As you can see, for example, from this pile of weapons-grade tosh from the Independent.

None of this scaremongering has any basis in reality, though, as Paul Homewood patiently explains in this masterly demolition job.

Here is a taste:

1) The record average temperature for the year of about 1.1C above pre-industrial levels Why is there no mention of the fact that satellite measurements of atmospheric temperatures prove that last year was statistically no warmer than 1998? Even if the figure is right, so what. Why should the Earth’s climate be any worse now than it was 10 years ago, or 50, or 150? 2) Millions of people going hungry after crops failed in parts of Africa as rainfall fell up to 60 per cent below average. Where is the context that proves this is in any way unusual or unprecedented? Why is there no mention of studies, such as this by McCabe &amp; Wolock in 2015, that there has been no trend in global droughts in the last century. Not to mention HH Lamb’s evidence that global cooling leads to worse droughts. 3) Flooding that displaced hundreds of thousands of people in south-east Asia In 1971, the Red River floods left 100,000 dead in North Vietnam. In the same year, Orissa in India was hit by a cyclone which left 10,800 dead, and 180,000 were affected in the Kuala Lumpur floods, reckoned to be the worst floods since 1926. https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/is-our-climate-becoming-more-extreme/ What is so special about 2016?

As is confirmed by a separate report — The State of the Climate in 2016 — published Wednesday by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, there is absolutely nothing weird, alarming, or unprecedented about current global weather patterns.

While 2016 was one of the warmest years on record, global temperatures dropped back at the end of the year to levels prior to the strong 2015/16 El Niño. This fact suggests that much of the global 2015–16 temperature peak was caused by a one of the strongest El Niños on record.

Since 2003, the global temperature estimate based on surface station measurements has consistently drifted away from the satellite-based estimate in a warm direction, and is now about 0.1◦C higher.

Much of the heat given off during the 2015–16 El Niño appears to have been transported to the polar regions, especially to the Arctic, causing severe weather phenomena and unseasonably high air temperatures.

Data from tide gauges all over the world suggest an average global sea-level rise of 1–1.5 mm/year, while the satellite-derived record suggests a rise of more than 3 mm/yr. This noticeable difference between the two data sets still has no broadly accepted explanation.

Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extents since 1979 have developed in opposite directions, decreasing and increasing, respectively. In the Arctic, a 5.3-year periodic variation is important, while for the Antarctic a cycle of about 4.5 years duration is important. Both these variations reached their minima simultaneously in 2016, which explains the recent minimum in global sea-ice extent.

The report’s author, Dr. Ole Humlum, Professor of Physical Geography at the University Centre in Svalbard (Norway), based his report on real-world observations — as opposed to the models and projections relied on by climate alarmists.

He says:

There is little doubt that we are living in a warm period. However, there is also little doubt that current climate change is not abnormal and not outside the range of natural variations that might be expected.

But don’t expect to read that reported anytime soon by the mainstream media.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afe6a08fc:13ae3b2:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee told Breitbart News Thursday evening he is looking for a compromise that will allow Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-WI)’s American Health Care Act to move forward for a vote on the House floor.

“We are listening to our colleagues, from those who are the most conservative to those who are the most moderate, about what are the final solutions that we need to achieve, so we can reach consensus,” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R.-TX), whose committee approved the RyanCare bill March 9. Brady is one of the committee chairmen who approved the “manager’s amendments” Monday, which made modest changes to the bill.

Thursday’s vote on the bill was canceled by Ryan after a bloc of conservatives, led by the House Freedom Caucus, secured north of 25 “no” votes. With 237 GOP congressman, Ryan cannot lose more 22 votes to reach the 216 votes required for passage.

The Ryancare bill is still a work in progress, Brady said.

“While it’s clear we do not have the votes, no one is walking away from the table–that means our members here in the House and certainly not in the White House as well, so let’s stay at the table,” he said.

“There are a number of new solutions to try to reach that common ground; let’s just keep working towards it,” he said.

Breitbart News spoke to the chairman less than 100 feet from Ryan’s office, where the speaker was meeting with members of the House Freedom Caucus and senior aides to President Donald Trump.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afde052dc:1169adc:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Every year, the United States spends $67.5 billion to ensure the worldwide free flow of oil. Often produced in unstable parts of the world and shipped through insecure chokepoints, the U.S. military works to make sure crude oil from other countries makes it safely onto the global market. Yet while this global oil market benefits some nations, its volatility threatens the American economy and undermines U.S. national security.

From technology to the weather, the factors affecting the price of oil are frequent and varied. One key constant, however, is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC), a cartel that uses its significant reserves of crude and concentrated political power structures to exert undue influence on the world price, affecting the U.S. economy as a result. This influence was felt most prominently and recently in our own energy industry. Amid the rising oil prices of the previous decade, a small group of innovative American producers used new technology to unlock the oil held in U.S. shale formations, long considered to be too expensive and limited to produce. This new production rewrote the energy rulebook, and our oil imports were halved.

Even as U.S. crude production rose, industry watchers were unconcerned about global oversupply, confident that OPEC—led by global swing producer Saudi Arabia—would take its usual approach and cut production. At the November 2014 OPEC meeting on Thanksgiving Day, however, that confidence evaporated. The cartel announced it would maintain its production levels, sending prices into a tailspin. In June 24, the price of oil was $110 per barrel. By January 2016, the price was just $26.

Although the price crash benefits consumers in the short-term, with average annual household spending on gasoline falling almost 21 percent between 2011 and 2015, the U.S. shale industry has struggled. Since January 2015, more than 220 oil companies have gone bankrupt, taking 150,000 jobs with them and nudging parts of the country that benefited from the oil boom back toward recession.

But despite this success in decimating America’s domestic oil industry, OPEC has not finished yet. Spurred on by domestic issues such as social spending, OPEC is shifting strategy and creating more volatility by bringing in Russia and others to collaborate on production as a “supercartel.” The group’s unprecedented influence stems from its control of 90 percent of global reserves, but these entities do not act in the free-market, profit maximizing manner of American producers. They serve instead as government proxies, generating revenues to support regimes that do not share U.S. strategic priorities.

Despite this clear conflict of interest, our military ensures the free flow of their crude because oil is vital to the U.S. economy, powering 92 percent of our transportation system. The global nature of oil pricing means that no matter how much oil we produce, our economic sovereignty remains jeopardized by OPEC and the supercartel.

To counter our reliance on this opaque oil market, we must develop a range of policy responses. First, we must develop more resources here at home. Second, we must modernize our fuel efficiency standards to maximize the benefits from the oil we use. Third, we must encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles running on diverse sources of domestic energy, including electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen. Finally, we must have an honest assessment of our ability to respond to OPEC’s actions to influence oil prices.

Work has already begun in Congress on this final recommendation, through the bipartisan introduction of H.R. 545 by Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Collin Peterson (D-MN), Trent Franks (R-AZ) and David Scott (D-GA). The bill creates a Congressional commission that investigates OPEC’s influence over the global oil market, examines America’s ability to mitigate the cartel’s effects and proposes a range of policy responses—trade, diplomatic, statutory and regulatory—to President Trump and Congress.

As American lives and our economic sovereignty continue to be risked to ensure a free flow of oil for countries that do not share our interests, the time for action is now. The President has rightly prioritized energy security in his America First Energy Plan, stating that his administration wants to, “Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations hostile to our interests.”

With President Trump in office, the opportunity to tackle OPEC’s outsized influence has presented itself. The swift establishment of this committee will give it the potential to frame the administration’s energy agenda for at least the next four years—and ensure, most importantly, that our energy system truly works in our national interest.

Rick Perry has accused administrators at Texas A&amp;M of disqualifying a student who was elected to serve as student body president “in the name of ‘diversity.&apos;”

Robert McIntosh, the son of a prominent Republican fundraiser who supported President Trump in his bid for the White House, was disqualified after winning an election for Texas A&amp;M’s student body president by over 700 votes. The position of student body president was awarded to the 2nd-place finisher, Bobby Brooks, a junior who became Texas A&amp;M’s first openly gay student body president.

McIntosh was initially disqualified over claims that he may have engaged in voter intimidation tactics. The concern was quickly dismissed by Texas A&amp;M’s Judicial Court, which The Washington Post calls “the university’s version of a student supreme court.”

But McIntosh’s disqualification was upheld, with the reason given that he “failed to disclose financial information for glow sticks briefly featured in a campaign video.”

Secretary of Energy and former Governor of Texas Rick Perry, who is an alumnus of Texas A&amp;M, wrote a column for The Houston Chronicle citing his concerns over the decision to take the position away from McIntosh over the purchase of glow sticks that appeared in his campaign video.

“As Texas’ first Aggie governor and as someone who was twice elected Yell Leader of Texas A&amp;M University, I am deeply troubled by the recent conduct of A&amp;M’s administration and Student Government Association (SGA) during the Aggie student-body president elections for 2017-2018,” he began.

Mainstream media outlets like The Washington Post were quick to question the motivations behind Secretary Perry’s criticisms, running the headline “Rick Perry accuses Texas A&amp;M’s first gay student body president of stealing election” on their Facebook page.

&quot;I viewed it as a testament to the Aggie character” – Rick Perry on election of gay student. Does this headline suggest that? pic.twitter.com/BNKB0iK9gT — Tommy (@tciccotta) March 23, 2017

Perry argued that the student body’s support of Brooks as an openly gay student was a “testament to the Aggie character.”

“When I first read that our student body had elected an openly gay man, Bobby Brooks, for president of the student body, I viewed it as a testament to the Aggie character. I was proud of our students because the election appeared to demonstrate a commitment to treating every student equally, judging on character rather than on personal characteristics,” he wrote.

Despite The Washington Post‘s suggestion, Perry’s criticism wasn’t pointed at Brooks; it was pointed at the administrators responsible for disqualifying McIntosh on a technicality.

“In its opinion, the Judicial Court admitted that the charges were minor and technical, but, incredibly, chose to uphold the disqualification, with no consideration given to whether the punishment fit the crime. The desire of the electorate is overturned, and thousands of student votes are disqualified because of free glow sticks that appeared for 11 seconds of a months-long campaign. Apparently, glow sticks merit the same punishment as voter intimidation,” he argued.

Perry claimed that McIntosh received the glow sticks for participating in a charity event before the campaign and also that the other candidates weren’t asked to itemize the expenses of props used in their campaign videos.

“Now, Brooks’ presidency is being treated as a victory for ‘diversity.’ It is difficult to escape the perception that this quest for ‘diversity’ is the real reason the election outcome was overturned,” Perry argued. “Does the principle of ‘diversity’ override and supersede all other values of our Aggie Honor Code?

“Honestly, we were just surprised to see that the secretary of energy would take the time to weigh in in detail,” Amy Smith, the school’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, told the Texas Tribune, “and we respectfully disagree with his assessment of what happened.”

Calling it a shameless, self-promotional “political stunt,” former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin’s website is not impressed with San Francisco 49ers second-string quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s $50K donation to the Meals On Wheels program.

Palin’s website slammed Kaepernick’s donation saying, “SERIOUSLY? Colin Kaepernick Just Pulled ANOTHER Political Stunt.”

Along with its knock against Kaepernick, the article written by website contributor Mary Kate Knorr noted that Donald Trump did not defund the Meals On Wheels program, gossip site TMZ reported.

The player, who spent the past NFL season protesting against the country by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem, recently declared himself a free agent but has thus far been unable to find a new team to continue his pro football career.

The Palin article specifically cited the player’s protests.

“His last stunt cost him the respect of most NFL officials, as teams across the country have chosen not to offer Kaepernick a contract following his kneeling-during-the-National-Anthem stunt last year,” the piece insisted.

Kaepernick did make his donation after liberals and the media began claiming that President Trump’s budget plan defunded the charitable program that feeds tens of thousands of needy Americans.

But, despite the media’s claims that Trump was taking money away from the program, a closer examination of the president’s budget revealed he wasn’t actually proposing any cuts to the program at all.

Ultimately, after TMZ highlighted the Palin article, for an unexplained reason the piece was pulled down from the former governor’s website.

President Donald Trump welcomed trucking organizations to the White House on Thursday, praising them for their contributions to the United States.

“No one knows America like truckers know America,” Trump said. “You see it every day, and you see every hill, and you see every valley, and you see every pothole on our roads that have to be redone, right?”

Trump praised truckers for transporting goods across the nation and keeping America running.

“You love America, and you love the spirit, and we love your spirit, and we want to thank you very much,” Trump said.

Trump spoke about the effect that Obamacare was having on truckers, as many of them were on private plans that suffered a rise in premiums and a loss in coverage and options.

He admitted that the White House still had work to do to get the bill across the finish line, just as the House of Representatives postponed the scheduled vote from Thursday night to Friday morning.

“Today, the House is voting to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare,” Trump said. “We’ll see what happens. It’s going to be a very close vote.”

Some of the trucks drove up to the White House, and Trump climbed into the cab of one and honked the horn.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—On Thursday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said that if Democrats tried to filibuster Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court, he would vote for the “constitutional option” to permanently end filibusters of nominees to the nation’s highest court.

For the first time in American history, in 2003 Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) persuaded Senate Democrats to use the upper chamber’s unlimited-debate rule on legislation to block a final vote on judicial nominations, at that time blocking several of George W. Bush’s nominees to the federal appeals courts.

Republicans then considered the constitutional option—also called the “nuclear option”—to restore the 200-year-old practice of always allowing votes on judges, by ruling that filibusters apply to legislation, but not to nominations. A decade ago, Graham became part of the “Gang of 14,” which negotiated allowing most of the stalled nominees to get a final confirmation vote in exchange for not abolishing the filibuster in the future.

Then in 2014, it was Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) who led Democrats in going nuclear over presidential nominations to the executive branch and every federal court except the Supreme Court. Republicans said the only reason Reid did not include the High Court at the time is that there were no vacancies at the time.

With Schumer taking things to a new level and vowing to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee, Graham ended months of commentators’ speculation by telling Mike Gallagher’s radio show:

If my Democratic colleagues choose to filibuster this guy, then they will be telling me that they don’t accept the election results—306 Electoral [College] votes—that they’re trying to delegitimize President Trump. And that’s not right, and we would have to change the rules to have the Supreme Court like everyone else.

There are 52 Republicans in the Senate. It would therefore take eight Democrats to reach 60 to invoke cloture on Gorsuch, or for all but two of the Republicans to hang together on the procedural question to clarify that the constitutional option applies to all presidential nominations, including those to the Supreme Court.

A scathing column in the Chinese government publication Global Times condemns the nation’s Communist allies in North Korea as “the most insecure country in the world,” calling for a political solution to tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.

The column, published this week, followed a visit by American Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to South Korea, Japan, and China. His hosts in China appeared extremely pleased by Tillerson’s use of “win-win cooperation” language – by now, boilerplate statements in Chinese diplomacy – and eager to cooperate economically with Washington.

The Global Times‘ columnists argued on Thursday that the fact that North Korea has continued to engage in belligerent, if also internationally embarrassing, military behavior is a sign that sanctions on Pyongyang are having the intended effect. North Korea attempted to launch a missile at Japan on Thursday, believed to be a response to international calls for dictator Kim Jong-un to abandon his illegal nuclear program. The missile in question “exploded right after it took off from a launch pad” and appeared to represent no danger to its intended target. As it exploded within seconds of launch, it was impossible for South Korea and U.S. military observers to confirm the exact target of the launch.

“The failure of this launch revealed the immaturity of North Korea’s missile technology,” the Times taunts. “The international sanctions have worked. It has become more difficult for North Korea to acquire resources for missile research and development.”

International sanctions, the Times continues, will “exert a long-term effect. They will seriously undermine missile research and development, but not endanger the survival of the Korean regime in the short-term.”

“North Korea has claimed to have nuclear weapons, but also has become the most insecure country in the world,” the authors argue. The Times recommends for China to continue participating in some sanctions against North Korea, but not all. “As long as China doesn’t completely close its border with North Korea, doesn’t implement a full embargo on food and necessities, and doesn’t pose a direct threat to the survival of the Korean regime, China and North Korea will not come to the point of confronting each other despite their cold relations,” the Times predicts.

China is North Korea’s largest trading partner and a fellow Communist nation, one of the few remaining on the globe. Up to 85 percent of North Korea’s international trade comes from China; the nation relies heavily on Chinese food and fuel exports, and the little it exports mostly goes to China. China has been reluctant to cut ties with Pyongyang, though recently opted to cease importing North Korean coal for the rest of the year. Beijing claimed it was “ludicrous” to suggest that the new policy was a response to the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, brother to Kim Jong-un and long believed to enjoy a positive relationship with China, instead suggesting Beijing was aspiring to adhering to U.N. sanctions requirements.

To make up for the profits it expected from Beijing, North Korea is publicizing a new tourist cruise program, seeking international investors to develop tours around North Korea’s mountainous Kosong port area.

North Korea also issued a rare condemnation of China’s behavior in halting North Korean coal imports in February. Without mentioning China by name, a column in the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) condemned the “friendly neighbor” as a “vassal state … dancing to the tune of the U.S. while defending its mean behavior with such excuses that it was meant not to have a negative impact on the living of the people in the DPRK but to check its nuclear program.”

China’s barbs at North Korea follow a period of somewhat surprising diplomacy between Beijing and Washington. While Secretary of State Tillerson used his Asia trip to pressure China into flexing its muscle to curb North Korean belligerence, he made his strongest public statements in Japan and South Korea, not China. “We look to China to fulfill its obligations and fully implement the sanctions called for,” Tillerson said in Tokyo last week. In China, he told reporters he was looking to expand “win-win cooperation.”

“His tone is widely seen as ‘moderate’ compared with his earlier statements in South Korea and Japan,” the Global Times said of his remarks in China. The publication also cited experts who praised his call for an end to the Obama-era policy of “strategic patience” with North Korea and his statement seeking a “new model of major power relations” with China. These indicate a possibility that China will aid the United States on the international stage in calling for sanctions, though much remains on the line in anticipation of President Xi Jinping’s meeting with President Donald Trump in April.

At the U.N., the Security Council is preparing to pass a new resolution this week condemning the atrocious human rights record of the Kim regime, according to the South Korea Foreign Ministry.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afd723216:12448f8:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Over 100 people gathered in front of the Hall of Justice in Downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday evening to protest L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell’s opposition to State Senate Bill 54, which would declare all of California a “sanctuary state.”

According to the Los Angeles Daily News, protesters held up signs that read, “One struggle, united” and “We demand immigrant rights.”

David Abud, with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, reportedly spoke over a loudspeaker against SB 54. He said McDonnell’s “argument is that if we don’t pass this, ICE is going to carpet-bomb our community with deportation. That is a ridiculous argument.”

Last month, 161 illegal aliens were arrested throughout Southern California by federal immigration authorities. (Some raids are reportedly ongoing.) The raids took place over the course of several days and resulted in the arrests of 680 illegal aliens across multiple states. That, in turn, upset many of the state’s Democratic lawmakers.

SB 54 was introduced by California State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) in December. In February, Breitbart News reported that de Léon said that “‘half his family’ was in the country illegally, using false documents, and eligible for deportation under President Trump’s new executive order against ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions.”

According to the Daily News, McDonnell wrote to De León earlier this month: “SB 54 would not allow the safe transfer of custody; rather it would force immigration enforcement agents into our communities in order to search out and find the person they seek. While doing this, they will most surely cast a wide net over our communities, apprehending and detaining those not originally the target of the enforcement actions.”

Breitbart News reported that on Tuesday, newly re-elected L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti released a new set of protections for illegal aliens that cement the city’s status as a sanctuary city, and defy the Trump administration’s efforts to ensure compliance with federal law.

SB 54 is likewise cast as a direct rejection of President Trump’s recent executive crder, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States.”

The January 25 Executive Order states: “Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afd723216:12448f7:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R.-WI) cancelled the anticipated vote on the American Health Care Act—RyanCare—the latest sign that the bill is in a death spiral.

Progress bringing the bill to the floor was stalled out when a compromise reached in principle between President Donald Trump and the chamber’s conservative bloc, the House Freedom Caucus, late Wednesday was not included in to the bill as a manager’s amendment. Manager’s amendments are privilege’s of relevant committee chairmen, who can change the language in a bill without going back to the full committee.

The HFC members accept that the RyanCare bill is not the repeal-and-replace of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that created Obamacare, but they insist that the speaker’s Obamacare rescue bill eliminate the Essential Health Benefits provision that requires a minimum of services in insurance policies, and they want to eliminate the Individual Mandate that RyanCare preserves as a program managed by the insurance companies, not the IRS.

As conservatives gain concessions in the RyanCare negotiations, more liberal Republicans have been dropping out, especially over cuts to Medicaid and a new promise by the president to keep illegal aliens from participating in RyanCare health plans.

The delay was announced at or around 3:30 p.m., which was also the time Ryan was supposed to hold a press conference about the bill. The press conference was originally scheduled for 11:30 a.m., which shows you what kind of day Ryan is having.

Shortly after he decided not to call the RyanCare bill for a floor vote, the Speaker ended a meeting with Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R.-WA), the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. After the meeting, McMorris Rodgers sent a blast email to all House Republicans telling them there would be a conference meeting at 7 p.m.

Texas Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe told reporters after receiving the email about the 7 p.m. meeting that he still could see the RyanCare bill coming up for a vote. To Ratcliffe’s point, there are procedural votes scheduled for the House floor beginning at 8 p.m.

Before the bill comes to the floor, the House Rules Committee must approve a rule with the bill’s most recent text. The committee has not yet approved the rule and as of publication of this story, the official language of the RyanCare bill stands at where it was Monday after certain manager’s amendments.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afd03d73c:1187030:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

With a vote on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch fast approaching, the NRA is making clear they will campaign against Red State Democrats who vote against the nominee.

There are number of Senate Democrats from Red States who are up for re-election in 2018. Gateway Pundit published a list of names that included Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Clair McCaskill (D-MO), Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Jon Tester (D-MT), among others.

Democrats in this list who vote against a Gorsuch confirmation will not only find themselves campaigning against a Republican challenger but against the NRA as well.

The Washington Examiner quoted a letter from NRA-ILA executive director Chris Cox, in which he wrote, “The NRA has every confidence that Judge Gorsuch will protect the Second Amendment rights of law abiding gun owners and will faithfully apply the Constitution in the cases that come before him. He has our strongest support for confirmation.”

Cox added, “Because of the importance of this issue to NRA members and gun owners throughout the country, votes on his confirmation will be considered in future candidate evaluations and we will notify our members accordingly.”

The New York Times shows that Senators Baldwin, Brown, Donnelly, Heitkamp, McCaskill, Nelson, and Tester already voted against the confirmation of pro-Second Amendment Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Those votes, plus any votes against Gorsuch, could only be expected to unleash the NRA’s unfettered campaigning power against the Red State Democrats.

It is also interesting to note that President Trump won all eight states represented above: Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri, Florida, Montana, and West Virginia. This alone puts added pressure on the Senators, should they vote against the nominee Trump put forward to save the Second Amendment from the machinations of the left.

Eighty percent of swing-voting independents, and 54 percent of GOP voters oppose cuts to Medicaid proposed by the GOP’s Ryancare plan, according to a new Quinnipiac poll.

The Medicaid question provided one of the few clear responses to a series of broad questions about opinions towards the still-forming GOP plan to reform the Obamacare healthcare network. The clear Medicaid question is useful because the GOP’s plan would clearly roll back, or cut, roughly 14 million people from Medicaid over the next several years, according to an estimate by an agency in the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Quinnipiac poll asked voters, “Do you support or oppose decreasing federal funding for Medicaid, a government program that helps pay for health care for low-income Americans?” The overall response was 74 percent against, including 80 percent opposition from swing voters and 54 percent opposition from GOP voters, among the voters who will decide the pending 2018 elections.

However, the poll did not show what percentages of the public had “strong” or “somewhat” opinion on each question.

The poll of 1,o56 voters was taken from March 16 to March 21, when little about the plan was known — or agreed upon — nationwide.

The vague questions in the poll included one asking for an assessment of President Donald Trump’s healthcare policies: “Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling – health care?” The response was 29 percent approval and 61 percent disapproval.

Another question asked “As president, do you think Donald Trump should – support efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, or not?,” which delivered a 45 percent positive answer and a 51 percent negative answer.

Another question, even vaguer than the prior questions, showed that 55 percent of voters want Congress to “repeal parts” of Obamacare. The pollsters did not ask which parts should be repealed or preserved.

However, the pollster did ask about funding for Planned Parenthood. The question “Do you support or oppose cutting off federal government funding to Planned Parenthood?” showed 68 percent opposition among swing-voters and 71 percent approval Republicans.

The poll did show little confidence among the public about whether the emerging GOP plan would help or hurt. When asked “what kind of impact do you think the Republican health care plan would have on your health care; do you think it would have a positive impact, a negative impact, or do you think it wouldn’t have much impact either way?” 47 percent of swing voters responded “not much impact, ” and only 12 percent of the independents expected a “positive impact.”

The Foundation for Art and Creative Technology in Liverpool has taken down Shia LaBeouf’s anti-Donald Trump “He Will Not Divide Us” art project just one day after its debut, marking the fourth such shutdown of the actor’s work since January.

In a statement on its Twitter page, FACT said it had removed the installation — which consisted of a flag with the phrase “He Will Not Divide Us” printed on it — from its rooftop due to “dangerous, illegal trespassing.”

On police advice, FACT and LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner have removed the installation HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US due to dangerous, illegal trespassing. — FACT (@FACT_Liverpool) March 23, 2017

The project — which LaBeouf launched with his frequent performance art collaborators Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner — began at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York, with a webcam pointed toward visitors who were encouraged to stare into it and repeat the titular phrase as many times as they wished. The project was to have remained active for President Trump’s entire first term in office.

The museum shut down the project in February, saying the site had attracted groups of protesters and political violence.

LaBeouf and his partners then relocated the project to the outside of a theater in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico, but that location was also abandoned after reports of gunshots in the area.

Earlier this month, LaBeouf relaunched the live stream with a simple white flag mounted at an undisclosed location. Using flight patterns and constellations, a group of Internet sleuths found the flag and replaced it with Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hat.

Following that incident, LaBeouf announced this week that he would move the anti-Trump art project to the UK.

“Events have shown that America is simply not safe enough for this artwork to exist,” LaBeouf, Ronkko and Turner wrote in a statement on the FACT website. “We are proud to be continuing the project at FACT, an arts centre at the heart of the community.”

LaBeouf, Ronkko and Turner had not yet commented on the installation’s removal by publication.

A representative for the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology did not immediately return Breitbart News’ request for comment.

Los Angeles (AFP) – President Donald Trump’s chest-thumping nationalism and harsh immigration policies are the subject of a new play depicting an apocalyptic America where stadiums are turned into prisons and people become sick, hungry and frightened.

“Building the Wall,” which opened last weekend in Los Angeles, was written by Robert Schenkkan, a two-time Tony winner who co-wrote the screenplay for the Oscar-nominated movie “Hacksaw Ridge.”

The play is set in the very near future, after the Trump administration makes good on a pledge to hunt down and arrest millions of unauthorized immigrants by imposing martial law. But things get horribly out of hand.

Schenkkan told AFP that the play is a very personal response to what he sees happening in the United States and many other countries: a “nativist, anti-immigrant, right-wing and proto-fascist” movement.

Trump took power in January with a promise to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally and build a wall along the border with Mexico. He started off by making it easier for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest unauthorized migrants.

Schenkkan sees Trump as an authoritarian, and this is the central premise of the play. Along the way, the writer asks members of the audience to stretch their imagination to the very limit.

All 100 minutes of the play unfold in just one place and with only two characters.

Gloria, played by Judith Moreland, is an African American history professor and Rick — Bo Foxworth — is a white Republican from Texas who oversees a privately owned prison and carries out a policy that would be unthinkable today.

His orders under martial law are to capture immigrants and their relatives and expel them from the country.

But what if no other country wants them? That is exactly what happens.

Jails become jam-packed as other solutions are sought, such as using a stadium as a prison. That what Latin American dictators did in the 1970s and 80s, and even creating a death camp disguised as an airport.

In this imaginary future, Trump has been impeached and removed from office, but little is said of the new government — only that people responsible for abuses are being put on trial, including Rick.

“I’m not saying that’s exactly what’s going on here,” said Schenkkan, 64.

“What we are witnessing, what we are experiencing, is a concerted attack on fundamental American values.”

– Latin voices –

Most immigrants living illegally in the United States are Latinos. Trump has said some Mexicans crossing the border are rapists and drug dealers.

In the play, although he does not appear on stage, the hero is a Latino adolescent held in the prison overseen by Rick.

The play, which depicts an unthinkably grim future, is an exercise in fiction, which allows for analysis of the Trump administration’s “quite hateful, divisive and incendiary rhetoric.”

“The success or failure of Trump’s authoritarian power will hinge entirely on the response of individuals” out on the streets, Schenkkan added.

“We are seeing both — an enormous outpouring of resistance on the part of many, many people, but we are also seeing, to my mind, a shocking level of complicity already from ordinary citizens and professional politicians and experts.”

Although aiming to entertain, the play tries — quite literally — to send a message to the US president.

As people file into the theater before the show, everyone gets a postcard addressed to the White House, complete with a stamp from the US Postal Service, to send off to Trump.

Throughout the play, the audience never sees the wall Trump wants to build and in fact does not know if it has even been erected.

But the play does leave audience members with a queasy feeling, as the wall is built out of bricks made from fear and isolation.

In addition to the production in Los Angeles, six US cities have expressed interest in staging the play, which could also travel to Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico and New Zealand.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afcccc18c:1133ffa:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Thursday at her weekly press briefing, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) discussed House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) saying Wednesday the intel community “incidentally collected” information on President Donald Trump’s transition team.

Pelosi accused Nunes of being “a stooge for the president of the United States” and therefore was “deeply compromised.”

Pelosi said, “Yesterday in another diversionary tactic, from the deflector in chief created some kind of scenario where he either duped or the chairman of the committee was a willing stooge. He committed a stunt at the White House yesterday raising questions about Chairman Nunes’ impartiality, especially given his history as part of the Trump transition team. The Republicans are grasping at straws after their embarrassing performance on Monday, a place where FBI Director Comey confirmed that President Obama did not wiretap President Trump, affirmed an FBI investigation to coordination between the Russian government and individuals of the Trump campaign and whether there was any coordination or connection between the campaign and Russia’s effort to undermine America’s election.”

She continued, “The necessity of an independent investigation is increasingly being recognized. I think that when Chairman Nunes acted the way he did, outside the circle of respect for his committee and his members and his ranking member, outside the circle of just, again, respect for the responsibility that he has as chairman of the intelligence committee by being a stooge for the president of the United States, going to him, going to the speaker, and going to the press before he even went to the ranking member of the committee — I think he’s demonstrated very clearly there’s no way there can be an impartial investigation under his leadership on that committee. It speaks very clearly to the need for an outside independent commission. As Senator McCain said, no longer does congress have the credibility to handle this one. Chairman Nunes is deeply compromised and he cannot possibly lead an honest investigation. As I said, congress must create a comprehensive, independent, bipartisan commission to expose the full truth about the Trump-Russia connection.”

Dr. Sebastian Gorka, deputy adviser to President Donald Trump and former National Security editor for Breitbart News, discussed the London terror attack with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily.

“We need to note that for jihadists, dates are very important: 9/11 itself was the anniversary of a great defeat against jihadi fighters centuries ago. The fact that this happened on the anniversary of the Brussels attack really should not have surprised anybody,” Gorka said.

“The attack itself shouldn’t have come out of the blue,” Gorka continued, referring to Kassam’s earlier mention of the broad-daylight decapitation of British soldier Lee Rigby, in which a vehicle was also used as a weapon. He also cited the “knife intifada” of random stabbings conducted by Palestinians against Israelis and the truck attack in Nice, France.

“These aren’t things that are coming out of the blue sky. These are methodologies that are being propagated and promoted by ISIS. This is how they think. They’re not interested in investing millions of dollars and time and energy and expertise in weapons of mass destruction. They’re going low-investment, high-yield – whether it’s stealing a truck in France and plowing into almost 90 people, whether it’s buying a knife and slashing people on the streets of Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. This is their new modus operandi. It costs nothing, and it is devastating,” he said.

Gorka said jihadis would continue to exploit the Western world’s vulnerability to these cheap and deadly truck and knife attacks until “the chattering classes think that they should ban vehicles the same way banning guns will make us safe.”

“This is the beauty of this attack: it’s not about the everyday item, the inanimate object. It’s about the person driving it or using it. That’s why good counterterrorism isn’t reactive; it is preventative,” Gorka argued. “That’s why you have to find these people, use human intelligence. Here in the United States, we’ve taken the step of our travel moratorium to stop people coming from war zones who want to use these kinds of tactics against us. Now there will be the focus on all kinds of diversionary issues, not the fact that this individual was already on the radar screen of the security services a year ago.”

Gorka said there has “never been a case of an upstanding citizen or immigrant on Monday deciding on Tuesday to become a jihadi and killing his fellow citizens.”

“There’s always a progression. There’s always a digestion of jihadi ideology. There’s always some kind of statement of sympathy for the things that the bad guys are doing. That’s how we find them. That’s how we prevent the next attack,” he declared.

Kassam argued that left-wing empathy for terrorists as oppressed people striking back against unfair foreign policy, economic deprivation, or religious discrimination nourishes the sense of grievance that fuels extremism. He also noted that Islamic leaders like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have a habit of describing refugees and immigrants as an army ready to rise up against evil Europe, which is at odds with the Left’s insistence that refugees are harmless in any quantity, from any point of origin.

Gorka responded with a favorite quote: “On the Left, reality is optional.”

“This isn’t about objective truth. It’s always been about narrative,” he elaborated. “For the last eight years, unfortunately, out of the White House, they’ve been spinning this narrative.”

“We’ve got to be super careful because if we don’t understand why this attack happened, we truly will become inured to these events,” he warned. “People will die, and then 24 hours later, we’re going to go back to business as usual.”

“The bottom line is this doesn’t happen because of grievances. This doesn’t happen because of unemployment or under-education. It happens because evil walks the earth. The Left will deny that. Their multiculturalism, their post-modernist relativism, denies the existence of evil. That’s why they were unqualified to fight this threat,” he said.

In contrast, Gorka said the Trump administration “understands people like yesterday’s attacker, the 7/7 bombers, Fort Hood, San Bernardino are a product of incarnate evil,” adding, “And we will defeat it, Raheem.”

Members of the House Freedom Caucus left a White House meeting on Thursday without reaching a deal to back the House-led effort to replace Obamacare.

President Donald Trump personally met with more than 30 members of the caucus but was unable to sway the caucus to support the bill.

“The group agreed that their ultimate goal is to implement a system that will drive down costs and increase access to healthcare for millions of Americans,” read a White House readout of the meeting. “This meeting was a positive step toward that goal.”

White House press secretary Sean Spicer asserted during the daily press briefing that some of the members in the caucus stood up and signaled their support for the president during the meeting. Spicer declined to name those who announced support for the president, but he said that the process was a “balancing act” and felt “very buoyed” by the results.

“I like the direction this thing is going,” Spicer said.

A congressional source familiar with the meeting identified Rep. Ted Poe from Texas as the only member of the Freedom Caucus who stood up to support the bill. The source downplayed the display of support, noting that Poe was expected to vote yes on the bill.

The White House revealed that the “Tuesday Group” House Republican moderates would also meet at the White House.

House Speaker Paul Ryan is expected to hold a press conference at 3:30 p.m. to address questions about the bill that is scheduled to take place at some point today.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afc959d25:f7dc77:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Thursday’s “Mike Gallagher Show,” Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) vowed that he would do “Whatever it takes” to get Judge Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and that if the Democrats filibuster Gorsuch, “we would have to change the rules to have the Supreme Court like everybody else.”

Graham said [relevant remarks begin around 2:00] that if there was a filibuster on Gorsuch, it would be “because politics has taken over reason, and that would be a shame.” When asked if he would have to use the nuclear option if there was a filibuster, Graham answered, “Whatever it takes to get him on the court, I will do.”

He further stated, “[I]f my Democratic colleagues choose to filibuster this guy, then they will be telling me that they don’t accept the election results, 306 electoral votes, that they’re trying to delegitimize President Trump, and that’s not right, and we would have to change the rules to have the Supreme Court like everybody else.”

Graham further said that he thinks there are Democrats who will vote for Gorsuch, and “I hope we can get 60 votes and not change 200-plus years of history.” He continued, “I will do whatever’s necessary, and I’ve been a pretty balanced guy, and enough is enough.”

Rep. Dave Brat describes the “political pressure” placed by the White House and Republican leadership upon conservatives to vote for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) as “overwhelming.”

Brat was a guest on The Laura Ingraham Show Thursday, where he described “pressure like crazy” with both the Trump administration and House Speaker Paul Ryan’s whips trying to get the votes they need to pass the bill.

A member of the House Freedom Caucus, Brat said he knows the grassroots base of the GOP wants Obamacare finally repealed, so for Republicans to vote for the AHCA – which many say “cements” the primary flaws found in Obamacare – could be detrimental to President Donald Trump.

“We want Trump to be hugely successful, so we don’t want to handle a bill that’s going to fail in a few years,” he told Breitbart News Saturday.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afc959d25:f7dc75:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

It would have been easy for Michael Savage to write a book about the election of Donald Trump that boils down to “I told you so.”

After all, Savage was one of Trump’s earliest supporters. But instead of taking the easy route, Savage has written Trump’s War: His Battle for America, a comprehensive battle plan for the Trump administration ranging from his familiar topics of “borders, language, and culture,” to economics and the deep state.

Savage’s thesis is straightforward. The election of President Donald Trump was not a final victory, but instead a first shot in the coming political war. He draws a comparison to the Revolutionary War in the first chapter:

The war for independence wasn’t won at Lexington and Concord in 1775. That was only the beginning. The colonists would have to fight the mightiest empire in the world for eight long years before their independence was finally secured. Trump and the patriots who elected him are going to have to fight their own eight-year war as well. The question is, what will that war look like? How is Donald Trump going to make good on all his campaign promises?

Savage’s detractors might be put off by the militant tone of the book, starting with its title: Trump’s War: His Battle for America. Savage considers this war to be a psychological fight, but we’ve witnessed physical violence against Trump supporters both before and after his election, and even allegedly against Michael Savage himself.

If you aren’t a regular listener of The Michael Savage Show, Trump’s War will be a baptism by fire. Savage is running on all cylinders from page one, which means this book has less in common with a smooth takeoff and ascent to cruising altitude than it does with a catapult-assisted launch from an aircraft carrier with afterburners aflame.

Savage pulls no punches in Trump’s War, he writes with the same trademark bombast with which he delivers his radio program. Former President Obama is called the “Marxist in Chief”, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is called “Obama’s beard.” The disdain Savage has for White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who he calls “Rinso,” is palpable throughout the book.

A Michael Savage book wouldn’t be authentic without including his style, but Trump’s War cannot be easily dismissed for a little name-calling. Savage makes thoughtful points in every chapter, backing up his opinions and thoughts with factual data that is frequently footnoted.

Savage brings fresh insight in Trump’s War to a key fight for President Trump, fixing health care in America. Dr. Savage’s Ph.D. in epidemiology and nutrition sciences make him uniquely qualified to comment on some of the failings of the American medical system, but most interestingly, his chapter on health care focuses on what was wrong with the system before Obamacare.

The FDA is a primary target for Savage, who makes the case that Trump must overhaul the agency to lower costs and promote competition amongst pharmaceutical companies. He illustrates this argument with the example of Mylan’s EpiPen, the price of which rose 540 percent over nine years. To quote Savage, “If Mylan had even two or three other competitors, do you think they would have been able to raise the price of the EpiPen more than 540 percent in nine years? Of course not.”

Savage doesn’t leave this analysis with the EpiPen, which has been in the headlines for months. He instead exposes the systemic nature of the problems at the FDA:

The problem is most people believe the EpiPen example is the outlier rather than the norm. It’s not. As of last July, the FDA had more than 4,000 generic drugs awaiting approval. That’s compared to just 24 on the European Medicines Agency’s waiting list! The EMA is Europe’s version of the FDA. How could Europe possibly be so much better at this than the United States? The FDA claims it’s just a matter of manpower. Every time a government agency fails, it wants more funding. Well, I have news for you. The EMA’s annual budget is €322.1 million, which is a little over $342 million in U.S. dollars. By comparison, the FDA’s annual budget was $4.9 billion in fiscal year 2016. That means the FDA spent 14 times more money to have a drug waiting list 168 times the size of Europe’s!

Michael Savage is most at odds throughout much of the book with Republicans he views as attempting to undermine Trump’s presidency. This won’t come as a surprise to regular listeners, as Savage has been an outsider for many years, but he frequently expresses concern that Trump’s worst enemies will come from the right, not from the left. Just consider this passage from the chapter “Trump’s War with the RINOs”:

Our job for 2017 and beyond is enormous. It’s bigger than it was before the election. Our battle has just begun. We can’t become complacent, settle back, and say, “Trump won; now I can relax.” Every minute of every day, even while you’re sleeping, the creeping nightmare that is the Republican Party takes over more territory within the Trump administration. We have to stand vigilant and support Trump against them. If we allow the party elites to succeed, we may as well have never elected Trump in the first place.

If Savage’s position on the Republican party wasn’t clear enough, he has added an asterisk to the title of the chapter, which leads to this note:

Rino originally stood for “Republicans in Name Only,” meaning a Republican who campaigned on conservative principles but then acted like a progressive once in power. I use the term in that sense, although the Republican Party has become so replete with liberal internationalists the acronym is somewhat a misnomer.

Savage is not shy about his support for Donald Trump. He considers Trump’s victory to be “God’s will.” But this book clearly shows that he will not be a cheerleader for the Trump administration. He states, “I will continue to do my job as a member of the fourth estate: to be a thorn in the government’s side, even Donald Trump’s government, if it goes off course.”

Savage is critical of both Trump appointees and statements that have come from the administration during its transition and early days. This extends beyond Reince Priebus — in this book Savage advises his readers to not blindly follow every decision the Trump administration makes. In fact, a section of the final chapter is devoted to the danger of those who are intolerant of dissent with Trump and his appointees, whom he derides as “true believers.”

Both fans of The Michael Savage Show and those less familiar with Savage’s works will find interesting and thought-provoking points in Trump’s War. The arguments he makes are often more nuanced than one would expect — for example, in his chapter on the environment, he both argues against the science behind global warming, but also for saving the whales. There are plenty of controversial points made in this book, ranging from conservation to the minimum wage, and there will be points the reader will disagree with. Savage expects this; his argument against “true believers” in Trump’s administration point towards a similar feeling about his own supporters, which he calls the “Savage Nation.”

Cooler heads are prevailing on Wall Street.

When stocks suffered their first 1 percent decline in over 100 days Tuesday, the consensus among traders and analysts was that the ‘Trump Trade’ that had sent markets soaring was coming to an end. Financial stocks, like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, led the sell off as skittish investors worried that signs of trouble for the American Health Care Act could mean that Trump wouldn’t be able to enact the fiscal and regulatory reforms he had campaigned on.

Just two-days later this narrative is in tatters. Stocks were mostly up Wednesday, with tech stocks showing surprising strength. Thursday morning trading pushed all the major indexes up. The financial stocks that had seen so much selling pressure earlier in the week are now leading the market up.

Yet the Obamacare replacement bill seems no more likely to pass than it did on Tuesday. What changed? Wall Street appears to be realizing that a failure to get the health care bill passed, particularly a failure driven by concerns of the most conservative members of the Republican caucus on Capitol Hill, probably doesn’t indicate that tax and regulatory reform are dead.

Jeff Cox at CNBC quotes Citigroup economist Dana Peterson’s note explaining this.

“Passage of the American Health Care Act vote is relevant for tax reform, but likely not in the way that markets and many observers may believe,” Peterson writes. “A failure of President Trump and House Republicans to deliver on this one of two stated objectives this year would not signal the death knell for fiscal stimulus, in our view.”

Goldman Sachs’ Alec Phillips sounded a similar note, Cox reports.

“There is likely to be much broader support for tax cuts than there is for health legislation,” Phillips writes. “Even if the health bill fails, we would continue to believe the odds of tax legislation passing by early 2018 are high.”

Other analysts have been pointing out that the core fundamental strengths of the American economy–such as rising job growth, buoyant consumer and business sentiment, and improving economic conditions around the globe–aren’t likely to suffer at all regardless of what happens to the health care bill.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afc959d25:f7dc73:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Time magazine Washington bureau chief Michael Scherer revealed the responses of an interview he conducted with President Donald Trump a day earlier.

In that interview, when questioned by Scherer about his tweet claiming to have been wiretapped by the previous administration and his lack of faith in the intelligence community, Trump wrapped up his response by pointing out he is president of the United States, and therefore can not being “so badly.”

Exchange as follows:

TRUMP: Hey look, in the mean time, I guess, I can’t be doing so badly, because I’m president, and you’re not. You know. Say hello to everybody OK? SCHERER: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

President Donald Trump recognized the death of Kurt Cochran, an American citizen that was killed in the terror attack in London on Wednesday.

“A great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the London terror attack,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.”

Cochran and his wife were tourists, according to Breitbart London, and among the first people hit by the extremist’s vehicle as he drove into the crowd on Westminster Bridge. Cochran was killed, but his wife is recovering in the hospital.

Vice President Mike Pence also expressed his condolences.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afc0b8116:e9e64d:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Thursday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell reacted to President Donald Trump’s comments from a rally earlier in the week where he took credit for quarterback Colin Kaepernick remaining unsigned.

“That’s a comment that he’s going to make and that’s fine,” Goodell said on ESPN Radio’s “Mike &amp; Mike.”

The commissioner went on to suggest that NFL teams are staying away from Kaepernick for his on-field production because they are more focused on winning.

“Our teams are out there working hard to figure out how they can improve each of their clubs,” Goodell added. “They’re making the best decisions they can. And they’re going to do what they can to improve their teams and win. That’s what they want to do for the fans. So, that’s what they’re focused on and that’s what we’re focused on. Everyone’s going to make other comments, and obviously we’re respectful of those comments, particularly from the president.”

He continued, “The 32 owners, I think their major focus here is on winning and whatever it takes to win and they think reflects well on their team, that’s what they’re gonna do. And so I think from their standpoint, they want to win, and they’re putting teams together and trying to find the players and coaches and everyone else who can help create that kind of chemistry that’s going to lead to a winning team.”

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, rushed Wednesday to criticize his Republican counterpart, committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), for informing the media and President Donald Trump about new evidence that the Trump transition team had been under surveillance before informing the committee. His statement showed absolutely no concern for the possibility that the intelligence services had abused their vast powers.

(Update: Nunes reportedly apologized to the committee on Thursday morning.)

Later on Wednesday, Schiff went further, claiming that he had “more than circumstantial” evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. That claim contradicts statements by former Obama administration officials that there is no evidence of any such collusion. If Schiff is making a false claim, it would not be the first time: at Monday’s committee hearing, Schiff claimed Trump associates watered down the GOP platform on Russia, a lie already debunked.

Schiff and his fellow Democrats are accusing Nunes of abusing his position to protect the president. The inverse is true: Schiff is abusing his position in an attempt to bring down the president.

His opening statement on Monday was a litany of false conspiracy theories that included the discredited Russia “dossier.” His antics earned comparisons to Joe McCarthy, and the task fell to Nunes to point out, in questioning the FBI director, that there was no evidence Russia “hacked” the election.

At times, Schiff has arguably abused his stature on the intelligence committee for partisan purposes. In 2015, he was a key voice in support of President Barack Obama’s disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, and suggested — bizarrely — that while it was deeply flawed, it could be improved later. Other Democrats, who did not have access to the same intelligence that he could see, studied the Iran deal more carefully and came to the conclusion that it would be a profound strategic mistake.

The purpose of the House Intelligence Committee is not just to allow politicians access to secret information. It is to make sure that the intelligence services obey the law and do not exceed the powers that Congress has — often reluctantly — given them.

As freshman Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) pointed out, in questioning FBI director James Comey, the agency inexplicably neglected to brief congressional leaders for more than half a year about investigations into Russian election interference.

That was disturbing enough, but the information Nunes described on Wednesday, which apparently included surveillance of members of the Trump family, is even worse.

As Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) pointed out Monday, some of the government’s powers of surveillance are due for reauthorization this fall. Those powers are arguably necessary to keep Americans safe. By by ignoring likely abuses of that power, and focusing on politics instead, Rep. Schiff is endangering that reauthorization.

It ought to have been easy for Schiff to say something like: “The new evidence described by Rep. Nunes raises important concerns about the possible abuse of government surveillance powers. Americans need to be reassured that the government will use those powers lawfully, and not for partisan political purposes, and I look forward to seeing the new evidence. At the same time, I am disappointed Rep. Nunes did not share that evidence with me first, and I intend to raise the issue with him.”

That would have been the right and responsible thing to do. It would have reassured Americans that both parties intend to police the behavior of the intelligence community, and prevent invasions of the rights of private citizens. It would also have emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation.

Instead, Schiff continues to politicize the investigation. There may be real consequences for Schiff’s irresponsible, partisan behavior — not for President Donald Trump, but for national security itself.

Israeli authorities have arrested a 19-year-old suspect in connection with dozens of hoax bomb threats to Jewish community centers in the United States and around the world. ABC News reports that the unnamed suspect is a dual U.S.-Israel citizen.

Other reports indicate that the suspect is Jewish.

The arrest was “part of an ongoing international investigation that has been taking place for several months with other police and security agencies in America and Europe,” Arutz Sheva reports.

Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said the suspect was “the guy who was behind the [Jewish Community Center] threats,” according to CBS News’ New York affiliate. The threats were also made in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as the U.S.

The suspect allegedly used technology in an attempt to hide his location. No motive for the hoax threats has yet been reported. The Jerusalem Post reports that the suspect is thought to be responsible for “most” of the threats.

The threats, causing panic at Jewish schools, synagogues, and community centers, were often blamed by Democrats and the some journalists on supporters of President Donald Trump.

When the president suggested that some of the antisemitic hate crimes could be hoaxes, the Huffington Post claimed he was echoing “white nationalists and far-right conspiracy theorists.” (Later, and in a subsequent address to Congress, President Trump explicitly condemned the wave of antisemitic threats.)

However, the arrests thus far suggest that most of the threats were indeed hoaxes. Earlier this month, another man was arrested for false threats against at least eight Jewish community centers. The suspect was a left-wing former journalist, who allegedly used the threats as part of a campaign of revenge against a former girlfriend.

One arrest last month concerned a suspect who allegedly vandalized Chicago’s Loop Synagogue and was apparently caught on surveillance video camera. The man, already facing a March trial on unrelated charges, was charged with a hate crime.

In December, a synagogue was vandalized with feces in Santa Monica, California. No arrest has yet been made in that case.

Almost all of the other hate crimes in recent weeks and months have been false bomb threats. Now, Israeli police believe they have identified the person responsible for most of those threats, which sparked panic worldwide.

Israeli minister of public security, Gilad Erdan, was quoted by ABC News as congratulating the Israeli police in solving the crime: “I congratulate the Israeli Police on leading a complex international investigation, together with law enforcement agencies from around the world, which led to the arrest of the suspect. We hope that this investigation will help shed light on some of the recent threats against Jewish institutions, which have caused great concern both among Jewish communities and the Israeli government.”

Partial transcript as follows:

CUOMO: Have you ever heard of the chair of an independent committee doing what Nunes just did? Getting some information that wasn’t necessarily new but was certainly helpful to the White House going around the committee, going to the press, and going to the White House.

CUMMINGS: No. As you know, I was ranking member of the Benghazi Committee. We would have never allowed that to happen. The Intelligence Committee is a very special committee. They are privy to information that most of the members of Congress may never see. And so you expect them to be extremely confidential.

What he did was basically to go to the president, who’s being investigated by the FBI and others, and by the Intelligence Committee, to give them information. Give them information. Basically, what he has done is he has scuttled and put a cloud over his own investigation. And he has become the subject basically — he should be — of an investigation. It’s a real problem.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afbeffd9e:e72ff8:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

LONDON (AP) — The Islamic State group claimed responsibility Thursday for an attack by a man who plowed an SUV into pedestrians on a crowded London bridge and then stabbed a police officer to death on the grounds of Britain’s Parliament.

The attacker was born in Britain and known to authorities who had once investigated him for links to religious extremism, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Thursday in a sweeping speech in which she also encouraged Britons to go about their lives.

The Islamic State group said through its Aamaq News Agency that the attacker was a soldier of the Islamic State who “carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of the coalition” of countries fighting IS in Syria and Iraq. In addition to the police officer and the attacker, who was shot by police, two people died on Westminster Bridge and at least 30 others were injured, seven critically.

British officials did not release the attacker’s identity or confirm a link with the Islamic State group, though May did say it would be wrong to describe the attack as “Islamic” extremism.

“It is Islamist terrorism,” she said. “It is a perversion of a great faith.”

The IS group has been responsible for numerous bloody attacks around the globe and has specifically called for Western followers to carry out this kind of attack in their own countries, though the group has also claimed attacks later found to have no clear links to it.

May set an unyielding tone Thursday in a sweeping statement before the House of Commons. While she honored the police, she also saluted the actions of millions of people who went about their lives as normal, describing it as proof that the act of terror failed.

“As I speak millions will be boarding trains and airplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth,” she told the House of Commons. “It is in these actions – millions of acts of normality – that we find the best response to terrorism —a response that denies our enemies their victory, that refuses to let them win, that shows we will never give in.”

Parliament began its moment of silence at 9:33 a.m., honoring the shoulder number of the murdered officer, Keith Palmer, a 15-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police and a former soldier. Then Parliament, which was locked down after the attack, returned to business — a counter to those who had attacked British democracy.

“Those who carry out such wicked and depraved acts as we saw yesterday can never triumph in our country and we must ensure it is not violence, hatred or division but decency and tolerance that prevails in our country,” Trade Secretary Liam Fox said.

“Hear, hear!” lawmakers from all parties responded in unison.

Police believe the attacker acted alone and there is no reason to believe “imminent further attacks” are planned, she said. He had been investigated before but police believed he was a peripheral figure, May said. At least eight people were arrested in raids, some in the city of Birmingham, in the central part of the country.

Mayor Sadiq Khan called for Londoners to attend a candlelit vigil at Trafalgar Square on Thursday evening in solidarity with the victims and their families and to show that London remains united.

London went on. Parliament Square, Westminster Bridge and several surrounding streets remain cordoned off by police. Scores of unarmed officers in bright yellow jackets were staffing the perimeter tape, guiding confused civil servants trying to get to work.

In Parliament’s New Palace Yard, a blue police tent was erected over the spot where the stabbing and shooting occurred, and two forensic officers worked at a trestle table nearby.

Metropolitan Police counterterrorism chief Mark Rowley revised the death toll from five to four, including the attacker, the police officer and two civilians. He said that 29 people required hospitalization and seven of them were in critical condition. He also said that authorities were still working out the number of “walking wounded.” Police had previously given the total number of injured as around 40.

One of those killed was Aysha Frade, a British national whose mother is Spanish, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said.

A doctor who treated the wounded from the bridge said some had “catastrophic” injuries. Three police officers returning from a ceremony to honor their bravery were among the injured.

May said people from 11 countries were among the victims. They included: 12 Britons, 3 French, 2 Romanians, 4 South Koreans, 1 German, 1 Pole, 1 Irish, 1 Chinese, 1 Italian, 1 American and two Greeks required hospital treatment. Police earlier said that seven of the 29 who are hospitalized are in critical condition.

The threat level for international terrorism in the U.K. was already listed at severe, meaning an attack was “highly likely.”

President Donald Trump was among world leaders offering condolences.

London has been a target for terrorism many times over past decades. Just this weekend, hundreds of armed police took part in an exercise simulating a “marauding” terrorist attack on the River Thames.

May underscored that the attack targeted “free people everywhere,” and she said she had a response: “You will not defeat us.”

“Let this be the message from this House and this nation today: our values will prevail,” she said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afbb90132:e1746c:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded to additional questions about President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his ties to Russia by pointing out the Clinton campaign’s ties to Russia instead.

Spicer reminded reporters that Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta sat on the board of a Kremlin-backed energy company, while his brother Tony Podesta lobbied against U.S. sanctions on Russian banks.

He also accused former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of having “much more extensive ties” with Russia than Trump.

As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, along with the Obama Administration, approved a deal that gave Russia one-fifth of America’s uranium reserves. Hillary’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, received over half-a-million dollars by a paid speech by a bank connected to the uranium deal. And Vladimir Putin personally called the former President and thanked him for giving the speech.

Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign in August after reports highlighted his business dealings with pro-Russian political forces in Ukraine. Today, the Associated Press reported that Manafort signed a $10 million contract in 2006 to represent the interests of a Russian billionaire close to Putin.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afb9d6baa:dee238:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Wednesday on MSNBC’s “For the Record,” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) discussed the House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) saying today the U.S. intelligence community “incidentally collected” information on President Donald Trump’s transition team and committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) saying there is more than circumstantial evidence in the investigation into potential collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia.

Because of those conclusions from Nunes and Schiff, McCain called for a special committee to take over the investigation because Congress no longer has the “credibility to handle this alone.”

McCain said, “What we need is a select committee. We know that the Russians interfered with our election and they did not achieve in affecting the outcome but we know that for sure. We know that there are cyber attacks going on all the time. There are leaks going on all the time. And so what we need to address this whole issue of what the Russians did, how they did it, the impact and what we do about it, I now believe belongs in the hands of a select committee.”

He continued, “I’m afraid that’s the conclusion I have reached and I didn’t do it lightly, but, yes, it is bizarre — the things that are being said. There is no substantiation for either what Chairman Nunes said or is there substantiation for what Congressman Schiff said.”

He added, “It’s a bizarre situation. So what I think, the reason why I’m calling for this select committee or a special committee is I think that this back and forth and what the American people have found out so far that no longer does the congress have the credibility to handle this alone. And I don’t say that lightly.”

The recently re-elected mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, released a new set of protections for illegal aliens on Tuesday, as cities across California step up their efforts to defy President Donald Trump’s crackdown.

Los Angeles Executive Directive 20, signed by Garcetti on Tuesday, will prohibit city employees or state funds from being used to serve the federal government unless obliged by law, while local law enforcement officials will be prohibited from asking any individual resident about his or her immigration status, or to arrest any suspected illegal aliens for being present in the U.S. illegally.

Garcetti has previously argued that enforcing immigration law would prevent officers from solving “real crimes” such as homicides, rapes, burglaries.

The head of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Chief Charlie Beck, reportedly said the measure was important to restore trust amongst between the city’s immigration populations and local law enforcement.

The new protections cement Los Angeles’s status as a sanctuary city, with the Department of Homeland Security on Monday publishing its first weekly list of all 118 localities refusing to cooperate with the Trump administration’s enforcement efforts.

On publishing the list, the Immigration and Custom’s Enforcement Agency’s (ICE) acting director Thomas Homan argued, according to a Fox News report, that “when law-enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders, it undermines ICE’s ability to protect the public safety and carry out its mission.”

In February, California’s Democrat-controlled legislature proposed a bill to make the state a “sanctuary state,” despite the risk of losing some federal funding if it does so. The proposal came despite a recent poll conducted by the University of California Berkeley finding the 74 percent of Californians would like to see sanctuary cities abolished.

Many of the wizards of Wall Street predicted stocks would slump if Donald Trump won the presidency. Now they’re worried that stocks could be vulnerable if President Trump’s agenda stalls in Washington, D.C.

Stocks suffered their “worst day of the year” on Tuesday–which is a scary way of saying that the major indexes suffered their first 1 percent decline in five months or 109 days. The consensus among Wall Street analysts puts the blame for the sell-off squarely on investors’ doubts about the ability for Trump to enact his agenda of regulatory reform, tax cuts, and infrastructure spending.

The Wall Street Journal’s Daily Shot chartist announced “The End of Trump-trade Tranquility.” A headline on MarketWatch warns, “Get ready for Trump Trade 2.0–a ‘deeper pullback’ for stocks.”

Why is Wall Street suddenly worried about Trump’s agenda stalling? The ongoing fight over the Republican healthcare bill is playing a significant factor. Many investors fear that Republican disunity on the healthcare bill could indicate that Trump will not be able to marshal support for his fiscal and regulatory agenda.

Those concerns are probably overblown, however. While Trump may face resistance from Washington’s Republican establishment on his infrastructure spending plans, as well as his trade and immigration reforms, the GOP is far more united when it comes to cutting taxes and reducing the regulatory burden on U.S. businesses. Even if the healthcare bill goes down, there is little reason to expect the things that were driving the so-called Trump Trade will also go down.

Put Tuesday’s sell-off in perspective. Just one day later, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P are basically unchanged. Even in the immediate aftermath of what appears to be a terrorist attack in London, stocks barely budged. In fact, much of the market is up Wednesday, with one company, footwear maker Nik, down by so much that it is dragging down the indexes. Even the stocks of big banks, which took the brunt of Tuesday’s sell-off, are steady. At least for now, the great Trump Trade sell-off has been put on hold.

Since 1928, there have only been 11 periods in which the S&amp;P 500 has gone for 100 days or more without a 1 percent decline, according to analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. The last time it happened was in December 1995. And these long winning streaks for stocks do not typically precede sharp sell-offs. Bespoke’s chart shows that on average, stocks gained 0.65 percent in the week after the initial 1 percent drop, with stocks dropping on 3 out of the 11 instances. The average one-month return after the drop is a gain of 2.34 percent, with only two instances of a decline. Three months later, the average return is 2.44 percent, with only three declines.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afb81eaa6:dc1200:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that “it’s hard to see” the GOP repudiating both President Trump and House Speaker Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Obamacare replacement.

Krauthammer said that while it’s too early to say Trump is facing a “make or break” moment, “it would certainly really damage the Trump presidency. And that’s why I think that, in the end, these things happen in every presidency, but when you have the fate of the presidency and the fate of a speakership hanging on the road, it’s hard to see that in the end, that his own party is going to repudiate them.”

He added, “I think, in the end, there’s so much at stake. And I think there is this Cruz option…that they take a risk, and add a change in what’s called the coverage mandate, all the things that Obamacare requires that you have in your plan, which is the worst part of the deal, that they are promising now, the HHS secretary will take out. But the conservatives are saying a new HHS secretary could restore it, so we want it in the law. I think that would be a reasonable offer to give to the conservatives, and that would ensure its passage.”

The deputy House Republican whip told Breitbart News that the House GOP leadership has the votes to pass the bill Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-WI) crafted to rescue Obamacare, named the American Health Care Act, scheduled for a vote Thursday.

“This is the biggest reform of Medicaid since the program was put in existence, probably the most biggest entitlement reform in the history of the government,” said Rep. Bill Flores (R.-TX), describing the pitch he makes to convince House Republicans to support the RyanCare bill.

Flores said the claim by the House Freedom Caucus to have at least 25 solid no votes does not jibe with his 0wn whip count.

It was great to hear from @POTUS this morning as we prepare to #RepealAndReplace #Obamacare. #PassTheBill pic.twitter.com/yNdjRn7oVJ — Rep. Bill Flores (@RepBillFlores) March 21, 2017

The Texan said GOP lawmakers are also supporting the bill because it puts patients and families back in control of their medical treatments. “There is not a one-size, government specified program and state’s have substantially more influence than they had in the past.”

The deputy whip said he is aware that House conservatives are not willing to accept that the RyanCare bill does not remove the Essential Benefits requirement from the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which created Obamacare, also known by the shorthand ACA.

Programs and infrastructure of Obamacare cannot be addressed in the American Health Care Act legislation because it is a budget bill, and the Byrd Rule prohibits non-budget related items from bills on the budget track, he said.

That fix is planned for later on in the process, when Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price makes administrative changes to the Obamacare regime, he said. “He has said he has hundreds of opportunities to change the implementation of the ACA, the original Obamacare bill. He’s rolled out two and he said his goal is roll out two-a-week, but he can’t signal those in advance.”

Flores said federal law, the Administrative Procedures Act, prohibits Price from telling lawmakers what rules and regulations he intends to change.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afb665d93:eb26e4:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The U.S. Marines have started blowing up 10 dams in Orange County, in the midst of an ongoing rainy season, and despite President Trump’s executive order to curtail the Obama administration’s controversial “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) regulation.

Local Orange County environmentalists howled on March 22 when the Orange County Register reported that U.S. Marines would use huge containers of C4-military explosive to blow up one dam along the Holy Jim Falls trail on March 21, and then two more on March 22.

President Trump on February 28 had ordered a start to the 90-day required review period before eliminating the Obama Administration’s 2015 “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) executive order that extended the 1972 Clean Water Act to give the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to re-wilding” authority over America’s smaller streams and marshes.

Although farmers, ranchers, builders and other private interests had successfully challenged the Obama administration WOTUS rules, the administration has had free reign to implement re-wilding on federal lands.

Orange County environmentalists supported the goals of WOTUS to restore riparian water flows to all U.S. rivers and creeks. But many went ballistic when they learned WOTUS would be used to obliterate 3 rock dams that created idyllic ponds that led the Holy Jim Falls trail to be named the “Best of the OC 2012” by the Register.

The 2.8-mile round-trip hike in the Cleveland Forest to the Holy Jim Falls only takes about two hours to walk. But the journey usually crosses a dozen little streams, and people enjoy swimming and fishing in the three ponds created by the man-made dams.

The “Save Holy Jim Dams” Facebook page reads like a horror story about the Obama administration’s environmental policies running amok. The U.S. Forest Service first mentioned that it was moving forward to remove the Holy Jim Falls trail’s hand-built rock ponds on March 7. But there was no mention of explosives being used or that the dams that provide flood control would be removed before the end of this year’s rainy season.

No one expected that the three “fishing holes” along the Holy Jim Falls trail would qualify to be part of the local Steelhead Recovery Plan to protect endangered fish, because it was documented that the only fish in area creeks were due to the U.S. Forest Service having stocked the Trabuco streams and ponds for decades.

The Save Holy Jim Dams page claims that as a result of the environmental studies, “Trabuco and Holy Jim were removed from there critical habitat map,” because it would have been an “absurdity” that fish could travel 20 miles up steep streams and waterfalls to spawn.

Local environmentalists are also baffled that the EPA decided to blow up the dams and release decades of silt that will wipeout significant amounts of newts, frogs and other “aquatic species breeding and residing in and near the water.”

The Register reported that the County of Orange has contracted with the U.S. Marines to soon start blowing up 7 other man-made dams along Silverado Creek.

An earlier version of this story stated, incorrectly, that the Marines had been paid $70,000 to destroy the dams. Olivia Walker, Public Affairs Officer for the Cleveland National Forest, wrote to Breitbart News: “The County of Orange gave us $70,000 in grant money to remove 81 dams, the Marines actually get paid nothing. They are doing this in partnership with us free of cost to save money.” We regret the error.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afb4ae21f:e8368d:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

California Governor Jerry Brown blasted President Donald Trump and House Republicans on Wednesday for their proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare. But he also rejected the idea of California providing a single-payer, universal health care system on its own.

State Democrats introduced legislation to create a single-payer system last month, and Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom endorsed a similar proposal earlier this month as part of his campaign to replace Brown in the 2018 elections.

But Brown is throwing cold water on the idea.

First, on Wednesday, the Golden State governor stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and challenged the president to “come down from Trump Tower.”

“Mr. Trump, come down from Trump Tower and walk among the people and see the damage that this latest exercise in raw political power will wreck among the women, the men and the children of this country,” he said, according to the Sacramento Bee.

He said that the American Health Care Act, which is slated for a vote on Thursday, was “written by people who don’t know what the hell they’re talking about.” And he warned: “This is not about health care reform, this is about disease, death and suffering”

But speaking to reporters later about what California might do if Obamacare were in fact repealed, Brown rejected the single-payer alternative preferred by many of his state’s Democrats.

The Los Angeles Times reports:

“I don’t even get it,” said the governor. “How do you do that?” He pointed out that the overall cost of medical care in California is equal to 18% of the state’s gross domestic product, which would be about $450 billion. “You take a problem and say I’m going to solve it by something that’s even a bigger problem, which makes no sense,” he said.

Brown, who has often acted as a brake on Democrats’ plans for additional government spending, stressed the daunting cost of paying for health care for everyone: “Where do you get the extra money? This is the whole question.”

Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz dodged questions asking him to explain why he is damaging shareholders’ investment in the company by promising to hire thousands of refugees instead of Americans.

Starbucks’ pro-refugee, anti-American policy announced in January is “based on principle” instead of politics, Schultz claimed Wednesday when he was confronted at a shareholders’ March 22 event in Seattle by Justin Danhof, the general counsel at the National Center for Public Policy, a free-market investor activist group.

Schultz will quit his CEO job at Starbucks on April 3, 2017, but will continue in the role as Starbucks’ executive chairman. He is a prominent liberal activist who was once suggested as a vice presidential candidate for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has been mentioned as someone who is “definitely being pursued” as a Democrat candidate for president in 2020.

The Starbucks event appeared to be a celebration of Schultz’s political ambitions, Danhof said in a subsequent press release:

This shareholder meeting was more of a validation of Howard Schultz’s liberal political agenda than a report to the company’s investors. Large portions were devoted to self-congratulation for promoting social justice than how the company is poised to differentiate its products in an increasingly competitive market. There was time for a musical guest, a stacked ‘open forum’ to praise the Starbucks social justice agenda and Howard Schultz pontificating on his vision of America, but very little time for actual company business and questions from shareholders. This was a rally, not a business meeting.

In January, Schultz directed Starbucks to announces its plan to hire 10,000 “refugees” in the United States and other countries after President Donald Trump issued his popular Executive Order putting a temporary moratorium on travel from a list of seven terror-torn countries.

Millions of Americans have fallen out of the labor force since 2007, so Starbucks’ policy caused a consumer pushback, and Starbucks’ brand name took a major hit among potential customer. Perception levels of the Starbucks brand name fell by an incredible two-thirds since its January announcement, according to a YouGov survey, as reported by Yahoo Finance. The stock value dropped below $54 per share but has since recovered to $55.89.

Danhof attended the Seattle meeting to ask why Schultz was using his CEO power to push a political agenda that hurts investors. “ABC News reports that in 2011, after discovering two al-Qaeda members with links to Iraq operating in Kentucky, ‘the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months… even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets,&apos;” Danhoff pointed out. “One Iraqi refugee, who had aided U.S. troops, was assassinated during the Obama-Clinton ban.”

That is when Schultz evaded the question with his claim that his policy “based on principle” instead of politics.

Danhoff pressed the issue asking:

“How much will Starbucks’ investors spend for us to properly vet refugees the federal government admits it can’t afford to vet? And why were you willing to have Starbucks’ reputation take a beating by attacking President Trump’s executive order when you lacked the courage to speak out against the Obama-Clinton travel ban?”

President Donald Trump continues to court members the Conservative House Freedom Caucus, pushing them to support the House-led bill to replace Obamacare.

The president has scheduled a meeting with members of the caucus at the White House, just hours before the bill is scheduled for a vote. Trump wants to make a deal, appearing willing to make last minute changes to woo conservatives to support the measure.

A White House source confirmed to Breitbart News that President Donald Trump took over the negotiations with the Freedom Caucus after it appeared that Speaker Paul Ryan and House leadership was paralyzed. Speaker Paul Ryan postponed his press conference scheduled for 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.

Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) (pictured) said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that he and Trump had come to an “agreement in principle,” about the bill, but was still hammering out details.

Meadows explained to reporters on Wednesday that members of the freedom caucus want to repeal Obamacare’s “essential health benefits” and Title I insurance regulations, in order to lower premiums.

“I think what we’re trying to do now is make sure that our agreement is actually something that can be executed in a way that passes the Senate,” Meadows told Hannity. “There’s still work to be done, but I can tell you that the president is all engaged.”

Trump released a video promoting the healthcare bill on Twitter.

“Go with our plan, it’s going to be terrific, you’re going to be very very happy,” he said, urging supporters to call congress and urge them to support the bill.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afb13c1f0:e176d0:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The chairman of the House Freedom Caucus told Fox News host Sean Hannity Wednesday night that he and President Donald Trump agreed to changes to the American Health Care Act, which had been destined for defeat on the House floor Thursday.

“I am really optimistic that we can get there; there are still a lot of details to work out,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R.-NC), whose bloc of north of 25 “No” votes is enough to sink the AHCA bill that was crafted by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-WI) as a rescue program for insurance companies.

Capitol Hill conservatives were angry when Ryan put forward his bill as the only Republican legislation reforming national health care policy. In 2015, every Republican in the House and Senate voted to pass a repeal of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which created Obamacare.

Instead of bringing back the 2015 full repeal bill, Ryan developed the American Health Care Act—RyanCare—in private working groups with insurance industry representatives, congressional staffers, and selected congressmen. The text of the bill was posted March 6 at 6:00 p.m., and the text remained unchanged as the bill passed through the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget committees.

If a final deal is struck and the RyanCare bill passes, the credit goes to Meadows, who early in the negotiations promised the president he would negotiate in good faith and continued to talk to the White House, even after Ryan and his team stopped talking to Meadows Tuesday.

Fellow House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Dave Brat (R.-VA) told Hannity that Meadows and the president were in touch with each other several times a day, as they worked to perfect the RyanCare bill.

In the past two weeks, House Republicans have accepted that the leadership was not going to allow the 2015 bill to come back, so they have focused on the essence of any reform: How do we lower premiums?

There are many moving parts, but conservatives have told the president and their leadership that they want to eliminate RyanCare’s revised individual mandate and essential health benefits requirements.

If there is movement from the Freedom Caucus, it would have to be related to these two items.

Brat said he stands with Meadows as he tries to make the bill one for which conservatives can vote.

Any deal had to have the effect of bending the cost curve down, he said. “There’s a heavy lift out there. We’re negotiating that heavy lift, and it will be the real deal.”

The House Rules Committee met Wednesday and adjourned without passing the final rule on how RyanCare would be debated on the floor and the degree to which amendments would be allowed. The Rules committee is called the “Speaker’s Committee,” because its members are hand-picked allies of the Speaker, and the committee is one of the instruments a Speaker uses to control legislation. It is significant that the Rules Committee failed to vote on and approve a rule for Thursday’s floor vote.

Meadows said it would not be accurate to say there was a settled deal, but that he and the president have reached an agreement in principle.

“I can tell you that the president is engaged, not only with the Freedom Caucus but with the unbelievably broad spectrum of the GOP Conference,” he said.

It is also important to word the amendment properly, so as to survive Senate rules, Meadows added.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15afb13c1f0:e176cd:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the architects of Obamacare, has reportedly become an advisor to President Trump as the Republican Party brawls over repealing and replacing Obama’s signature health care law.

Emanuel was seen meeting with Trump in the Oval Office at the White House on Monday in a confab that reportedly lasted 40 minutes, the Washington Post reports.

Also attending the meeting with the President were Vice President Mike Pence, Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, presidential adviser Jared Kushner, White House National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.

Emanuel, the brother of Chicago Mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, seems to be one of the few liberals advising the Trump administration as the party wrangles over its plan to attack Obamacare. Emanuel was a top adviser to Obama and helped formulate the law.

Even as he confirmed the meeting, Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer was quick to note that the president and Emanuel have major differences of opinion.

“Obviously, [Emanuel] and the president have some differing views on the best way to make health care affordable and accessible,” Spicer said. “But the president also strongly believes that the health and well-being of the American people shouldn’t always be a partisan issue,” he added.

In an interview from last weekend, Emanuel said he thinks he is “the only person on the Democratic side who, for crazy reasons, they’ve agreed to talk to.”

But Emanuel also revealed that Donald Trump had asked him for a meeting some time ago, even before the inauguration. Indeed, Emanuel already met with Trump once before in December, just after the election.

“I take the president seriously when he says he wants to get everyone in the country covered,” Emanuel said.

In 2014, Emanuel sparked outrage in an article he wrote for The Atlantic in which he claimed he only wants to live to 75 years of age, a comment that again sparked fears that he favored government-run, healthcare “death panels.” Many claims that Obamacare would eventually include “death panels” aimed at refusing medical coverage to older or sicker patients were based on Emanuel’s paper exploring government-funded health care, in which he admitted that resources would be finite and some stark decisions would have to be made.

Emanuel also admitted that many of the Obama’s administration’s claims that the ACA would save money were “lipstick” claims that will never really pan out.

Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “The O’Reilly Factor,” Rep. Peter King (R-NY), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, admitted after his committee’s review of President Donald Trump’s claim the Obama administration had wiretapped his transition team, he had a “legitimate case to make,” but said he may have overstepped with his Twitter claim.

“[T]he president had a very legitimate case to make,” King said. “He overstepped it by saying President Obama ordered wiretapping. That we don’t know, but what we do know is to me this is shameful.”

Host Bill O’Reilly pressed King on the seriousness of Trump being “surveilled,” to which King said it was at least 99.5 percent correct he was surveilled.

“I would say, from all I know, you’re at least 99-and-a-half percent accurate, and probably 100 percent,” he replied.

Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) tweeted Wednesday he is changing his vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) from “No” to “Hell No.”

Sorry if I let you down. I&apos;m changing my vote on #AHCA pic.twitter.com/JLUotqaO9L — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) March 22, 2017

Massie earlier this month told the Washington Examiner the GOP plan was a “stinking pile of garbage” that was written by the “insurance lobby.”

“I think the [American Healthcare Act] was written by the same people that wrote Obamacare,” he said. “That’s why it looks so similar.”

On Wednesday, Massie told CNN’s OutFront he is “afraid” President Donald Trump is “a one-term president” if the ACHA passes.

“They may pull the bill from the floor, or they may push it to the floor, and if they do, I think it’ll fail,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af9ad5254:ae8a43:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “OutFront,” Thomas Massie (R-KY) stated that he’s “afraid” President Trump is “a one-term president” if the American Health Care Act passes.

Massie said, “They may pull the bill from the floor, or they may push it to the floor, and if they do, I think it’ll fail.

He added, “We’re afraid he’s a one-term president if this passes. We are trying to save him.”

When asked about whether he was worried if Trump would campaign against him if he voted against the AHCA, Massie answered, “[I]n Kentucky, the vote against this bill is still the right vote, whether Democrats are for no or Republicans are for no, there’s just no constituency for this bill in Kentucky.”

Massie concluded, “[W]hen president trump took the advice of the Heritage [Foundation], the Federalist Society, and came up with a good Supreme Court nominee, he was a hero. But then when he started taking the advice of [House Speaker Representative] Paul Ryan (R-WI) and lobbyists here in Washington, DC, his ratings went down ten points. And I hope that’s what he sees from this, that we’re trying to save him from bad advice, and maybe he’ll start taking advice from those conservatives again.”

White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that there was no option to repeal and replace Obamacare other than the bill put forward by Speaker Paul Ryan and House Republicans.

Breitbart News asked Spicer during the White House press briefing if President Donald Trump planned to leave Obamacare in place and move onto other issues if the House bill failed.

Spicer denied the premise.

“We’re not going to leave it in place because we’re going to repeal and replace it tomorrow, move it through the Senate, and the president will sign the bill,” he said.

Spicer pointed out that conservatives like Rep. Steve King now support the bill, as well as Rep. Lou Barletta.

“We continue to see the enthusiasm and momentum coming to our direction,” Spicer insisted, despite 25 House Freedom Caucus conservatives reasserting their decision to vote against the bill.

The bill needs 216 votes to pass and, as Democrats remain unanimously opposed to the House legislation, only 21 Republicans can vote against the bill or it fails.

In recent days, Trump signaled he is eager to get health care done so he can move on to other issues like trade and tax reform.

But the White House denied that there was any consideration of an “Option B” on health care if the first plan failed.

“This is the only train leaving the station,” Spicer said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af9236290:afc96b:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The hot topic for sports media is still that NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has not yet signed anywhere as a free agent, and at least one commentator now says that Kaepernick will never shake the accusation that he hates America.

ESPN’s Jemele Hill made an interesting point in a recent tweet saying that the NFL can excuse a lot of bad behavior by players, but Kaepernick’s perceived anti-Americanism is one that can’t be ignored.

No, he won&apos;t. In the NFL you can re-package an abuser, a drunk driver and a multitude of sins. But an &quot;anti-American?&quot; Nope. https://t.co/yZlsQN9DZx — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) March 22, 2017

That is a solid point, for sure. The league has allowed wife abusers, drug users, past gang members, and tax cheats continue playing, but Colin Kaepernick’s transgression was against the whole country and seems far more than a mere personal failing, especially for a sport that wants to be considered as America’s game.

Hill added another thought to the discussion after President Donald Trump took some measure of credit for Kaepernick’s troubles.

Think we&apos;ve seen the last of Kaep as an NFL player. There was a limited market before but after Trump&apos;s comments, it&apos;s a wrap. https://t.co/Jr2HioMSCy — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) March 22, 2017

The ESPNer is referring to Trump’s March 20 rally in Louisville, Kentucky, where the president slammed Kaepernick, broaching the subject by assuring the audience that no one wants a “nasty tweet from Donald Trump.”

As the crowd roared, the president continued, saying, “I said, if I remember that one, I’m going to the people of Kentucky because they like when people actually stand for the American flag.”

This is far from the first time Trump has criticized Kaepernick. Last August he told The Hill newspaper that maybe Kaepernick “should find a country that works better for him.”

The news that the 49ers second-string quarterback can’t find a new birth in the NFL is on the tongue of nearly every sports commentator, as Sporting News noted.

To mention a few, Los Angeles Times sports columnist Bill Plaschke says Kaepernick is “clearly” being blackballed for his anti-American protests, Mike Golic of ESPN2’s “Mike &amp; Mike in the Morning” also noted that team executives and owners are wary about bringing Kaepernick’s sort of trouble to their teams, and Mike Freeman of Bleacher Report exclaimed that Kaepernick is being punished “for the crime of speaking his mind.”

Sports reporters aren’t the only ones claiming Kaepernick is being mistreated. A growing list of liberals are now insisting that the NFL’s pass on hiring the player is evidence of “racism.”

Sixty mayors from around the country on Tuesday held press conferences and other events to show their support for immigrants both legal and illegal.

The U.S. Conference of Mayors helped organize the effort dubbed “Cities Day of Immigration Action.” The organization collected the names of the mayors and cities participating in the event and the actions they would be taking, including pledges to:

Hold an in-person event such as a local press conference, town hall, roundtable or “Know Your Rights” forum

Pass a city resolution, proclamation, ordinance or other official document commemorating the day

Send out a press release

Pen an op-ed

Amplify your activities via social media using #MayorsStand4All

The mayor of Austin, Texas, Steve Adler, Tweeted an article entitled “Mayors Celebrate Immigrants While Facing ICE’s New ‘Non-Cooperative’ City List” using the hashtag “MayorsStand4All.”

.@routefifty: Mayors Celebrate Immigrants While Facing ICE’s New ‘Non-Cooperative’ City List #MayorsStand4All https://t.co/jkmiQzh5sr — Mayor Adler (@MayorAdler) March 22, 2017

Breitbart Texas reported that ICE, under the Trump Administration, is now publishing a weekly Declined Detainer Outcome Reports, demonstrating the crimes for which aliens have been accused. The maiden report revealed that sanctuary jurisdictions released 206 criminal aliens from their jails. Texas leads the nation with more than 70 percent of cases. While there were 149 criminal aliens released from Texas jails, 142 were released in Travis County.

One day before the #MayorsStand4All events, Jessica Vaughan with the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) told Breitbart Texas, “The report from DHS is commendable, but also alarming. Now the public can understand exactly who is benefiting from the sanctuary policies–the released criminal aliens.”

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings used the #MayorsStand4All hashtag to welcome the director of the new “Office of Welcoming Communities and Immigrant Affairs.”

The Dallas mayor has been outspoken for the rights of Syrian refugees and illegal aliens, and has stood against Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s efforts to stop the flow of refugees into the Lone Star State.

Mayor de Blasio held a press conference outside of the Tweed Courthouse in Manhattan and said absent a court order, he will shut-out ICE agents from the city’s schools. “We will not allow ICE agents to threaten that protection, disrupt classes or take any action that would be detrimental to our students,” de Blasio said, reported Breitbart News. When questioned, the NYC mayor admitted that ICE agents have not gone into the schools but ominously added, “we’re seeing things that we have not seen before and there’s a tremendous amount of fear out there. We have to be ready for anything.”

Our schools will not become part of the president’s deportation machine. #MayorsStand4All pic.twitter.com/RpZUe0ZZ2F — Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 21, 2017

The New York Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs issued a letter to students and families the same day stating that ICE agents would not be permitted in the schools. It also declared that the NYC Department of Education (NYC DoE) would not be releasing information about students and would be “expanding Know Your Rights workshops for students, parents and community members.”

City officials in Washington, D.C., Nashville Mayor Megan Barry, and Kansas City Mayor Sly James participated in the Cities’ Day of Immigration Action along with 57 other mayors and cities.

Not everyone who used the hashtag “MayorsStand4All” was supportive of the mayors.

This individual may have been noting the recent rape and sodomization of a 14-year-old girl at Rockville High School in Maryland.

#MayorsStand4All is a nifty way of saying &quot;your daughters are less important to us than illegal aliens (aka:future Democrat voters).&quot; — Ben Crystal (@Bennettruth) March 22, 2017

Others were clear in their reference to the alleged sexual assault. One of the males charged, 18-year-old Sanchez Milian, had a deportation order pending at the time of the alleged assault. The Guatemalan was allowed to enroll as a freshman, reported Breitbart News. Seventeen-year-old Jose O. Montano, the other student charged, is from El Salvador. Sean Spicer criticized sanctuary jurisdictions saying the tragic crime was why President Trump is so “passionate” about buckling down on illegal immigration. Rockville High School is located in Montgomery County, Maryland, a county that is listed as a sanctuary jurisdiction, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.

Illegal immigrants get more passes in US than Americans &amp; because of this we get horrific crimes like #RockvilleRape sick! #MayorsStand4All — TrumpStrong (@TrumpStrong45) March 21, 2017

One of those Tweeting under #MayorsStand4All said it was ironic that the hashtag was trending at the same time as “#rockvillerape” and added, “Mayors should stand for citizens first. PERIOD.”

It’s well known President Trump loves gold . Well, he will be displaying that affinity once again, when he appears on a three-night Golf Channel tribute to the legendary golfer, “The Golden Bear,” Jack Nicklaus.

A well-known golf enthusiast, Trump, who claims to have won several club championships, will join the premier golf network in a salute to arguably the greatest golfer who ever walked the planet.

Bloomberg reports that the program on Nicklaus, titled “Jack,” will air on Sunday, April 9 at 9 p.m.ET.

The 45th president of the United States asserts in the special that, “People like Jack, they have a desire to win. They never give up, they never quit. He’s a man that’s led a truly exemplary life; his family, his work ethic, his championship status. He’s a very exceptional man.”

During NBCUniversal’s 2016 Summer Press Day, golf’s all-time record holder for major championships praised Trump, when the New York billionaire was running for the nation’s highest office: “I have known Donald for a long time, through the game of golf. He’s been very supportive of a lot of things I have done.” Nicklaus added, “I think he’s going to be good in the office, going to do a good job.

“But, I’m very supportive of all our presidents.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af8b50f11:a68cdb:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Wednesday on ABC’s ‘The View,” MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said President Donald Trump “totally” could have leaked his own 2005 taxes, which she featured on her show last week.

Maddow said, “It totally could’ve come from Trump, which is like such a bizarre human drama at the center of this. As far as I’m concerned, the only thing that matters is, is that document real? That’s the story.”

During his Supreme Court confirmation hearing on Tuesday, federal judge Neil Gorsuch was repeatedly asked about his stand on abortion and whether he would overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade High Court ruling that found women had the right to privacy in medical and reproductive matters, which in practice made abortion on demand legal in the United States.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is holding the hearings, asked Gorsuch about the case.

“I think the case most people are thinking about right now and the case that every nominee gets asked about [is] Roe v. Wade,” Grassely asked. “Can you tell me whether Roe was decided correctly?”

“It is a precedent of the United States Supreme Court,” Gorsuch said. “It was reaffirmed in Casey in 1992, and in several other cases. So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the United States Supreme Court, worthy as treatment of precedent like any other,” he added.

The Supreme Court ruled in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992 that states can put certain restrictions on abortion as long as those restrictions don’t create “undue burden” for women seeking to have an abortion.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) asked Gorsuch if President Donald Trump ever asked him if he would overturn Roe v. Wade.

“I would have walked out the door,” Gorsuch said.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) asked Gorsuch if he thought Roe v. Wade amounted to a “super precedent” law, a term referring to a law that has be upheld so many times it could be difficult to undo.

Gorsuch did not directly answer the question. During the past three days of questioning, Gorsuch has repeatedly said that he has to be cautious about commenting on specific issues that could come before him if he is confirmed as an associate justice on the court.

Gorsuch has also said, correctly, that legal abortion is currently “the law of the land.”

“As wrong as Roe is, Judge Gorsuch is correct that it is currently the law of the land,” said Ken Klulkowski, senior legal editor for Breitbart News. “This does not mean that if given the opportunity that he would not vote to overrule Roe.”

“Judge Gorsuch’s statement is completely consistent with pro-lifers’ hopes and President Trump’s campaign promise,” Klukowski said.

Although Democrats are resisting Gorsuch’s Supreme Court nomination, none opposed his nomination to be a federal appellate judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where he has served for ten years.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af899950b:a3b17a:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

It sounds like the Deep State is getting nervous. Politico’s Nahal Toosi and Andrew Restuccia report that some federal bureaucrats are “panicked” by articles in Breitbart News and other conservative sites shining a light on Obama administration holdovers.

From Politico:

Conservative news outlets, including one with links to a top White House official, are singling out individual career government employees for criticism, suggesting in articles that certain staffers will not be sufficiently loyal to President Donald Trump by virtue of their work under former President Barack Obama.

The articles — which have appeared in Breitbart News, the Conservative Review and other outlets — have alarmed veteran officials in both parties as well as current executive branch staffers. They say the stories are adding to tensions between career staffers and political appointees as they begin to implement Trump’s agenda, and they worry that the stories could inspire Trump to try purging federal agencies of perceived enemies.

The claims posted on the conservative sites include allegations of anti-Israel and pro-Iran bias against staffers at institutions such as the State Department and the National Security Council. Breitbart News, whose former executive chairman Steve Bannon is now Trump’s chief strategist, has even published lists of workers that the president should fire.

Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said President Donald Trump has been “fed a bill of goods” by House leadership on the proposed House Republican health care legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Paul said, “You know, I think that he has been told things by House leadership that frankly just are not accurate. He’s been told this is the only vehicle, and Paul Ryan’s been saying it for weeks, ‘it’s a binary choice, you either take it, it’s my way or the highway,’ I think he’s been fed a bill of goods on this thing, and I do believe that there’s something that could pass, that actually would bring down insurance costs, but this bill doesn’t do it. I’ve fought against Obamacare for six years, I am a physician and I want to repeal it, but I don’t want to repeal it and replace it with something that just as bad or doesn’t work.

Documentary filmmaker and leftist activist Michael Moore used his Instagram account Wednesday to urge the Democratic Party to declare a “national emergency” until the FBI completes an investigation into alleged connections between President Trump and his campaign staff and the Russian government.

“The Democratic Party needs to declare a National Emergency,” Moore wrote in a post Wednesday, along with an image of the robot HAL 9000 from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. “For the first time in our history, the President of the United States and his staff are under investigation for espionage. This announcement, by the head of the Trump-friendly FBI, is a shock to our democracy.”

The Democratic Party needs to declare a National Emergency. For the first time in our history, the President of the United States and his staff are under investigation for espionage. This announcement, by the head of the Trump-friendly FBI, is a shock to our democracy. The Democratic leadership in the House and Senate needs to bring a halt to all business being done in the name of this potential felony suspect, Donald J. Trump. No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation. His presidency has no legitimacy until the FBI – and an independent investigative committee — discovers the truth. Fellow citizens, demand the Democrats cease all business. &quot;The American people have a right to know if their President is a crook.&quot; — Richard Nixon A post shared by Michael Moore (@michaelfmoore) on Mar 21, 2017 at 11:46pm PDT

FBI director James Comey said Money that the agency was “investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts,” though he acknowledged that the agency had thus far found no evidence to support oft-claimed “collusion” between the two.

In his Instagram post, the 62-year-old Where to Invade Next director called on Democrats to impose a “halt to all business” being conducted by Trump, whom he called a “potential felony suspect.”

“No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation,” Moore wrote. “His presidency has no legitimacy until the FBI – and an independent investigative committee — discovers the truth. Fellow citizens, demand the Democrats cease all business.”

Moore has been one of Trump’s most outspoken celebrity detractors since the start of his campaign.

The filmmaker released a surprise documentary, Michael Moore in TrumpLand, with the aim of persuading voters to vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton with just weeks to go in the 2016 race.

In January, Moore vowed to lead a campaign of “100 days of resistance” against Trump’s presidency; shortly before the inauguration, the filmmaker hosted a large protest rally outside Trump Tower in Manhattan, alongside other celebrity Trump critics Alec Baldwin, Robert de Niro and Mark Ruffalo.

In February, Moore took to Twitter to lament that Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch, was “Obama’s to make and it was stolen by Republicans.”

“Senate Dems, let’s be very clear,” he wrote. “You will filibuster &amp; block this SC nom or we will find a true progressive and primary u in next election.”

Citing investigative reporting by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) and advance reporting by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group, Rep. Louie Gohmert is calling for a congressional investigation into the connection between Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chairman, John Podesta, and Russia.

Podesta sat on the board of the Putin-connected energy company alongside Russian officials who received $35 million from a Putin-linked Russian government fund, Breitbart News reported last August, as revealed in a 56-page GAI report titled “From Russia with Money: Hillary Clinton, the Russian Reset, and Cronyism.”

Now Gohmert, the Texas Republican firebrand who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, says Podesta’s role in the Russia-funded firm “certainly needs to be reviewed to see if there really is something nefarious going on with these activities.”

Podesta also sat on the executive board of an energy company, Joule Unlimited, which also received millions from a Putin-connected Russian government fund. The longtime Democratic operative owned “75,000 common shares” in Joule, which Podesta had transferred to a holding company called Leonidio LLC.

According to the GAI report, “Two months after Podesta joined the board, Vladimir Putin’s Rusnano announced that it would invest up to one billion rubles into Joule Unlimited, which amounts to $35 million. That represents one-fifth of the entire amount of investment dollars Joule collected from 2007 to 2013.”

Furthermore, Joule board members also included senior Russian officials.

Podesta had failed to fully disclose his position on Joule Unlimited’s board of directors and include it in his federal financial disclosures, as required by law, before he became President Obama’s senior adviser in January 2014.

A federal lawsuit, The Daily Caller reports, cites Podesta’s role in funneling billions in devalued Russian currency into U.S.-based tech companies:

An ongoing federal lawsuit, Neas Ltd, v. Rusnano, which is now before the U.S. District Court for Northern California, suggests Podesta and others at Joule may have unwittingly assisted Rusnano in a scheme hatched to move billions of weak rubles into valuable U.S. dollars by parking them as “investments” in high-tech companies in Boston and in Silicon Valley.

Gohmert’s call for a federal probe into Podesta’s Russian ties comes amid a partisan push to link President Donald Trump and his aides to Russian influence-peddling and collusion during the presidential campaign.

However, evidence of collusion to advance Putin’s Russia started years before Trump announced his presidential bid.

As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton spearheaded U.S. involvement in a Russian government technology initiative called Skolkovo. The Russian government’s stated goal for Skolkovo, touted as “innovation city,” was to be the Russian equivalent of America’s Silicon Valley. Skolkovo housed more than 30,000 workers in state-of-the-art facilities under Kremlin control.

Despite the FBI and the U.S. Army’s warning that Putin could use Skolkovo to accelerate its military technological capabilities, Hillary Clinton’s State Department and her campaign manager developed alarming relationships with Kremlin-controlled entities.

House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes did not rule out Senior Obama administration officials being involved in “incidental” communications of President Donald Trump’s transition team that were “widely disseminated.”

When asked by Breitbart News if he could rule out any involvement of senior members of the Obama administration, Nunes replied, “No, we cannot.”

Nunes briefed President Donald Trump at the White House this afternoon, speaking to reporters immediately after the meeting.

He confirmed that the new intelligence had nothing to do with the FBI investigation into Russia, but that it was picked up in normal intelligence efforts.

“What I’ve read bothers me, and I think it should bother the president himself and his team, because I think some of it seems to be inappropriate,” he said.

Nunes said that Trump was “concerned” by the news, “And he should be.”

“I don’t think the American people would be comfortable with it,” he said when asked to characterize the nature of the intelligence.

Nunes said that some of the information was communicated to him by intelligence sources.

“We’ve been asking for people to come forward and they came through the proper channels … I’m just going to leave it at that,” he said.

He added that the National Security Agency was “cooperating very very well” with the ongoing investigation.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af80fc806:96d284:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

House Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes announced Wednesday that members of President Donald Trump’s transition team, including the President-elect, were “incidentally” surveilled by the intelligence community, additional names of the transition team were “unmasked,” and that the information was not obtained in relation to Russia.

Nunes recalled his recent confirmation that information on members of the Trump transition team had been incidentally collected by the intelligence community on numerous occasions. “Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting.”

“Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked,” said Nunes. When later asked by reporters if the President was also included in the incidental collection of information, Nunes replied, “Yes.” In response to another reporter, Nunes said “it’s possible” that Trump’s personal communication was collected.

Rep. Nunes later went on to say of “dozens” of reports he has seen thus far, “I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the President-elect and his team were, I guess, at least monitored and disseminated out in intelligence in what appears to be…intelligence reporting channels.” He added that he is, however, awaiting further information.

The representative’s fourth point was emphatic, “…none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team.”

He made clear that the House Intelligence Committee will investigate surveillance of Trump associates and subsequent dissemination of information gathered. He stated that the goal is to determine:

Who was aware of it Why it was not disclosed to Congress Who requested and authorized the additional unmasking Whether anyone directed the intelligence community to focus on Trump associates Whether any laws, regulations, or procedures were violated

Nunes said that he believes the collection was done legally, but questions remain as to unmasking and the dissemination list of information collected during the transition during the months of November, December, and January.

Rep. Nunes characterized the information that was collected as “A lot of it appears like it was…it was essentially a lot of information on the President-elect and his transition team and what they were doing.”

He said he has asked the Directors of FBI, NSA, and CIA to “expeditiously comply” with his March 15 letter and provide a full account of such surveillance activities. Nunes called the NSA very, very helpful. He expects additional information to come on Friday.

Rep. Nunes said he has not seen any information that has anything to do with Russia or the Russian investigation. He said that while he expects more information and did not make an absolute determination on how the information was collected, “It was not criminal, it was normal, foreign surveillance is what it looked like to me, but let’s wait until we get all the information.”

“This appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under FISA, where there was incidental collection that then ended up in reporting channels and that was widely disseminated,” said Nunes.

Rep. Nunes said he was surprised and alarmed by the discovery of this information, “because we went through this about a year and a half ago as it related to members of Congress…”

Nunes stated that he would travel to the White House in the afternoon to share the new information he has with President Trump.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in an interview published Tuesday that he did not want or seek the position and only took it because his wife convinced him to do it.

“I didn’t want this job. I didn’t seek this job,” Tillerson told IJR in an interview with the sole reporter allowed to accompany him on his recent Asia trip. “My wife told me I’m supposed to do this.”

Tillerson said he never met with President Trump before the election, but Trump asked to meet with him at Trump Tower after winning the presidential election to talk “about the world” and Tillerson’s experience as CEO of ExxonMobil.

“When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,” Tillerson shared.

When Tillerson told his wife about the offer, he said she responded, “I told you God’s not through with you.”

“I was supposed to retire in March, this month. I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids,” Tillerson added.

Tillerson stated that he serves in the role “at the pleasure of the president.”

“My wife convinced me,” he said. “She was right. I’m supposed to do this.”

Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of state in February in a 56-43 Senate vote.

Reuters reported that Tillerson is skipping a NATO meeting next month to stay in the U.S. for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s meeting with the president at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af7862627:88b733:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) announced on Wednesday that he had learned that members of President Donald Trump’s transition team had been under surveillance by the Obama administration, that individual names had been “unmasked” by the intelligence community, and that those names had been leaked to the media.

Nunes’s information — which he said he would deliver to the White House later — vindicates the bulk of Trump’s claims earlier this month.

Nunes said that while there was no direct “wiretap” by President Barack Obama of Trump Tower, there was indeed surveillance — perhaps collected incidentally — of people close to Trump, possibly including Trump himself.

Much of that had been suspected, on the basis of mainstream media reports, but Rep. Nunes reported something new: that the surveillance did not involve the ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) inquiry into Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Indeed, none of the surveillance had intelligence value, he said.

“I believe it was all done legally,” Nunes told a press conference. The question, he said, was why names of those swept up in the surveillance had been leaked. The collection of the intelligence appeared to have been legal, but the leaking may have been illegal.

Most of the activity occurred during the transition period from November to January. Furthermore, Nunes said, he did not know whether phone calls — including phone calls involving Trump — were among the communications captured.

Nunes added that the new information had come to light after Monday’s hearing with FBI Director James Comey, when the congressman had appealed to anyone with new information to come forward. He said the new revelations had been “legally brought to me by sources who thought that we should know it.

The new information vindicates earlier reporting by Breitbart News, Mark Levin, and others, and which President Trump may have relied upon in tweeting the wiretapping claim Mar. 4.

Following Monday’s hearing, the mainstream media appeared to celebrate Comey’s statement that there was no evidence of wiretapping at Trump Tower. Politicians, too, piled on — including some Republicans, like Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who demanded that Trump apologize to Obama.

However, the only new revelation at the hearing was that senior members of the Obama administration may have been involved in “unmasking” former General Michael Flynn in intelligence reports.

Wednesday’s revelations by Rep. Nunes confirm earlier media reports of surveillance of Trump aides and associates, with the added twist that the revelations were unrelated to investigations of Russian ties to the Trump campaign.

No evidence of any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign has been found, and former Obama administration intelligence officials have said publicly that such evidence does not exist.

Though the media, and the political opposition, had attacked Trump for his claims about wiretapping, he later clarified that he had used the term to refer to surveillance in a general sense. He also suggested that more evidence would soon emerge.

The result is a vindication of Trump’s controversial claims. Questions remain about whether President Obama himself knew of the surveillance, which other Obama administration officials were involved, and whether Trump was monitored directly.

President Donald Trump “strongly supports” the house Obamacare replacement effort spearheaded by Speaker Paul Ryan, according to a statement of administration policy sent to House Republicans.

“This bill begins to fulfill the President’s commitment to rescue Americans from the failures of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and expand access to affordable, quality healthcare,” the statement from the executive office of the president read.

The statement adds that the bill is only part of the three step process to repeal and replace Obamacare.

“If H.R. 1628 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law,” the statement read.

Conservative opponents of the bill continue to voice discontent about the bill in it’s current form, as administration officials and members of House leadership work to corral enough Republican votes to pass the legislation. The House vote on the bill is scheduled for Thursday.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af7862627:88b72f:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Bestselling conservative author Ann Coulter, one of President Donald Trump’s earliest and staunchest supporters, railed against the Obamacare 2.0 bill championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday.

Obamacare 2.0 would inflict severe healthcare costs on Rust Belt voters while easing taxes on counties that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, according to Bloomberg News. Trump swept into the White House on a populist wave because voters protested mass immigration policies, erosive trade deals, and never-ending Middle Eastern military conflicts—not because they wanted another “crazy corporatist agenda,” Coulter tweeted.

Michigan Republican Rep.

Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” former Obama administration Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that although he was “concerned” about President Donald Trump’s tweets, he believed Trump has the potential to be a “great president.”

“I actually believe that Donald Trump — and I told him this when I met with him in December,” he said. “I actually believe Donald Trump has the potential to be a great president in sort of the Nixon goes to China way or Reagan goes to the Soviet Union way. If he can find a way to rein in some of — some of the more unhealthy impulses, listen to his staff, bring on a full complement of political appointees who will help him govern.”

“And I’m very concerned about the tweets, obviously,” Johnson continued. “And very concerned about the direction we’re taking in a lot of — in a lot of national security areas. I’m concerned that we’re — when it comes to Homeland Security, we may be fighting the last war. We may be responding to the terrorist attack of ten years ago versus the next one. I used to tell my people, don’t respond to the last terrorist attack, prepare for the next one. And given where we are right now with the current threat environment, we need to focus on home-grown, home-born violent extremist, which is something we did a lot of in the last administration.

The White House announced Tuesday that President Donald Trump would personally attend a NATO summit in April.

Democrat critics and media pundits spent most of Tuesday lamenting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reported plans to skip an April meeting with NATO leaders in Brussels, while planning a trip to Russian in the same month. Trump’s plans were announced Tuesday evening.

“The President looks forward to meeting with his NATO counterparts to reaffirm our strong commitment to NATO, and to discuss issues critical to the alliance, especially allied responsibility-sharing and NATO’s role in the fight against terrorism,” read a statement from the White House.

The president will attend a meeting with NATO leaders in May held in Brussels.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af7862627:88b727:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday the rape of a 14-year-old Rockville High School freshman shows why President Donald Trump is so “passionate” about cracking down on illegal immigration.

“This is a tragic event, and it is horrendous, and horrible, and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. I can’t possibly imagine,” Spicer said at the White House on Tuesday.

Illegal alien suspects Henry E. Sanchez Milian, 18, and Jose Montano, 17, allegedly raped her orally, vaginally, and anally, sometimes simultaneously, on Mar. 16 as she cried out in pain and begged them to stop in a boy’s bathroom stall, according to a police interview with the victim. Sanchez Milian is a Guatemala native and Montano is from El Salvador. Both arrived in the U.S. several months ago, and a Border Patrol agent encountered Sanchez Milian in Texas.

A forensic specialist found blood and bodily fluids in the boy’s bathroom after the victim reported the alleged rape to school staff. The attack took place one month before the victim’s fifteenth birthday, according to the date of birth marked on the detective’s statement of probable cause.

Montgomery County, Maryland, where the alleged rape took place, is a sanctuary city, according to the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). The county made an executive decision in October 2014 to “not honor [an] ICE detainer without adequate probable cause.” From January 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015, the county declined 70 ICE detainer requests, including 63 for illegal aliens with criminal histories.

“Let’s remember the human side of this, that this is a tragic event that no child, no person, no parent should ever have to deal with,” Spicer continued. “School should be a place where a parent puts their child on a bus or drops them off, and knows that they are safe. The idea that this occurred is shocking, disturbing, horrific, and whatever words someone can think of.”

While school officials have released no information on the alleged victim, Spicer implied she was a legal immigrant or refugee.

“This young woman in particular fought to come to this country legally, because of the freedoms and treasures of this nation and to think this tragedy would occur to someone who has personally endured that kind of struggle to come to this nation and then face this is reprehensible,” he said. “And it’s not who we are as a country.”

“Part of the reason the president has made illegal immigration and [a] crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this,” Spicer added later. “Part of the reason is the tragedy this young girl dealt with, had inflicted upon her, whatever the word is. This is why he’s passionate about this. Because people are victims of these crimes.”

There are economic and national security consequences for allowing uncontrolled illegal immigration, Spicer said, “but immigration pays its toll on our people if it’s not done legally, and it’s another example why the president is so passionate about this.”

“But’s why he recognizes why it’s multi-faceted: Why we have to be tough at the border, why I just read off this executive order dealing with people that have committed crimes, who local enforcement agencies or municipalities or the state level are not dealing with it,” Spicer said.

“And if you go to the ICE website and download this, you’ll see it’s over 30-something pages of cases where there’s a person that is convicted of a crime that local and municipal law enforcement, for whatever reason, and in some cases they’re prohibited, but for one reason or another are not enforcing the law and not turning that individual over to federal authorities to be deported,” he added, referring to a weekly report published by ICE highlighting the different jurisdictions who refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) placed an immigration detainer request on the 18-year-old Sanchez, who is a citizen of Guatemala, but would not comment on the 17-year-old Montano since he is a minor.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af6c5339a:739fb4:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) joked that “you might be asking the wrong guy” when SiriusXM host Alex Marlow asked him to explain the House Obamacare bill on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily.

“This bill would replace the subsidies, penalties, and mandates of Obamacare with subsidies, penalties, and mandates of what we’re calling ‘Obamacare-lite,’” said Massie, who is obviously not a supporter of the bill.

“Frankly, the number of calls to my office – and we only keep track of the constituents who call, in other words, those who are among the 750,000 people I represent – the calls are running 275 against this bill to 4 supporting the bill,” he revealed. “That’s like almost 100 to 1 against this bill. And I can tell you, every other congressional office is receiving the same number of calls.”

“Now, half of these people that are calling want to keep Obamacare, and the other half want a full repeal, but nobody’s happy with this bill,” he continued.

“Why did they rush this out there right now? Why did we have to discuss this two months into this administration?” Marlow asked of the hastily prepared replacement bill.

“Look, there’s two things going on Capitol Hill today,” Massie replied. “There’s Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing, and then there’s this Obamacare-lite. Trump came to sell this bill to us, but it’s not his bill. Look at the two examples of how things turned out for Trump. In one case, he went to Heritage and the Federalist Society and said, ‘Give me some good nominees.’ In the other case, he went to Paul Ryan and the lobbyists and said, ‘What kind of bill do you want?’ You can see the kind of reaction he’s getting. Hopefully, this will be informative to him on where he should go for conservative advice.”

Massie said he could confirm the vote count offered by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who has predicted the bill will be pulled and extensively rewritten.

“I have personally spoken to 29 colleagues here, conservative colleagues who oppose the bill as of yesterday evening. That’s not counting the moderates, and there are at least six of those on the record in the news. So there are three dozen against this bill,” he said.

“What are the people saying that are for this on Capitol Hill? Well, they’re trying to tell us it’s a binary decision, that you can either take it or leave it,” Massie said of the bill’s proponents. “We think the negotiation starts when one party says ‘no.’ That’s why we’re going to say no.”

“They’re saying it’s better than nothing. It’s better than leaving Obamacare in place. That in itself is false,” he contended. “If you keep the mandate on insurance companies, that they have to charge everybody the same price whether they’re healthy or not, and then get rid of the individual mandate – I’m no fan of the individual mandate, but those two things go together. Republicans are trying to keep one of them and do away with the other, and this thing is going to fail miserably.”

“Prices are going to go through the roof. People are going to flee. Healthy people are going to flee the insurance market that’s going to exist after this, and we’re going to get blamed for it. So I’m not going for their argument that this is better than nothing. This is worse than Obamacare, and we’re going to own it. We’re going to own it lock, stock, and barrel,” he predicted.

Massie elaborated that under the House bill, prices would go up faster than under Obamacare as it stands, which will “further decimate the market.”

“There’s nothing in this that legalizes affordable insurance,” he complained. “It’s still got the ten mandates on what insurance companies have to cover. That’s going to keep prices high, and it’s still got the pre-existing condition mandate. It’s still got a ratio between young people and older people, like how much more older people can be charged than the younger people, that’s a distortion of the free market. All those things are still in there, and prices are going to go up. This is my prediction.”

“In fact, the Republican version of the individual mandate is a 30 percent penalty if you let your policy lapse in the course of a year. The CBO says that Republican penalty, the 30 percent penalty, will keep two million people from buying insurance,” he elaborated.

“That’s the opposite of an introductory offer. Remember those record deals where you get your first 12 records for a penny? Well, this is the opposite. You’re going to pay $30 apiece for the first 12 albums. That’s going to keep people out of the market. Frankly, Jonathan Gruber is a much better architect of socialized medicine than Republicans are,” Massie said.

“They’re flirting with socialism,” he said of the Republican caucus and White House when Marlow pointed out that original Obamacare architect Ezekiel Emanuel has been involved in crafting the GOP plan and has reportedly met with President Trump himself.

Massie denounced the “false argument” that the flawed Obamacare bill must be passed quickly so the Republicans can move on to tax reform.

“In fact, they’re trying to say you only get like two bites at the apple through reconciliation,” he said. “Go back and look at how they did Obamacare. They did student loans on the same reconciliation bill that they tweaked Obamacare with when they passed Obamacare.”

“There are a lot of false arguments here that are falling flat on their face: the argument that we have a binary choice, the argument that you’ve got to do this if you want to do tax reform. We’re used to being lied to here on the Hill. I don’t think Trump is used to being deceived in this manner, and I think he is being deceived by House leadership – on everything from the ramifications to the cost of health care from this bill to the probability of it passing tomorrow,” he said.

Marlow asked Massie to talk about his own legislative crusade to abolish the Department of Education.

“When Betsy DeVos was up for her confirmation, I was receiving dozens of calls. People wanted me to stop her, and I said that vote happens in the Senate, not in the House. I don’t actually have a vote,” he recalled. “They said, ‘We know you can do something. Do anything you can in the House.’ So the day they voted on Betsy DeVos, I walked to the floor and introduced a bill that’s only eight words long. It says, ‘The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31st, 2018.’ That’s the whole bill.”

“A lot of liberals are sort of apathetic about the Department of Education, now that it’s not their president, and it’s not their nominee who’s writing these edicts for all of the school systems across the country,” he observed. “I thought it was the perfect time to do it. It’s received a lot of support. I’m up to nine co-sponsors, including Chairman Chaffetz, chairman of the Oversight Committee. I think it’s a great opportunity, and the wonderful thing is now, for the first time since Ronald Reagan, we’ve got a president in the White House who would probably sign this bill if it got to his desk.”

Massie said it was important for listeners to express their support for his effort to their representatives.

“Let me tell you this: phone calls matter,” he said. “I wouldn’t bother writing letters or sending emails or faxes, but whenever you call your congressman – and by the way, it’s got to be your congressman and your two senators – it makes a difference. I’ve been on the floor talking to my colleagues who are undecided about how to vote, and they tell me, ‘Oh, I’ve got this many phone calls or that many phone calls.’ They ask me how many phone calls did I get for or against.”

“So that is the most effective way, I think, to communicate with your congressman, or get on their social media and make a comment – because as a congressman I can tell you we read those comments, whether we respond to them or not,” he advised. “I usually respond, but most congressmen are reading their own Twitter and their own Facebook.”

Massie said he was not one of the Kentucky congressmen chosen to accompany President Trump on his visit to the state Monday. “I tell people I didn’t even get a ticket on Amtrak One, much less Air Force One,” he joked.

“It’s an interesting phenomenon in Kentucky,” he observed. “We’ve got Senator Paul against this bill. I’m against this bill. I can’t speak for our governor, but it’s interesting that he has not come out and publicly supported this bill. We’re one of those Medicaid expansion states where we’ve got to try and get the genie back in the bottle, and the governor is doing a great job working on that, but he’s not going head-over-heels for this bill, even though Trump and Mike Pence have both been to Kentucky.”

“Our senior senator has been silent on this bill, as well,” Massie added, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “I think he’s probably one of the smartest of the bunch because he’s not spending any political capital on a bill that’s probably dead on arrival in his chamber.

Rep. Massie invited listeners to follow and interact with him on Facebook and Twitter.

Five have died, including a police officer, after a knifeman mowed down pedestrians and attacked police outside Britain’s Houses of Parliament on Wednesday.

Shots were heard late afternoon on Wednesday, with authorities confirming within minutes that the Parliament was on lock down and Members of Parliament were kept in the Commons chamber.

Less than an hour after the attack London’s Metropolitan Police declared they were treating the attack as a “terrorist incident”.

Incident in #Westminster: We are treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise — Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) March 22, 2017

The latest:



The story so far:

Eyewitnesses report between “eight and ten” figures on the ground on Westminster Bridge, believed to have been the victim of a car ramming attack using a 4×4 vehicle. Eyewitnesses have told how the vehicle mounted the pavement and mowed down pedestrians.

It is currently believed the driver of the car then turned the corner onto Parliament Square before getting out of the car and attempting to get into the grounds of the Palace of Westminster, stabbing a police officer along the way.

The man is believed to have been shot by police and put in an air ambulance to a nearby hospital.

Britain’s Prime Minister, Theresa May, is said to have been in the division chamber, voting after Prime Minister’s Questions, when she was whisked away by a plain-clothes police officer. An air ambulance helicopter has touched down in Parliament square after the attack, which is thought to have consisted of a car attack and a knifeman.

The police and the director of security of the House of Commons have advised the Chamber of the House to be locked down.

Spokesman for President of the United States Donald Trump Sean Spicer confirmed by Twitter Wednesday afternoon that the President had been briefed on the attack.

.@POTUS has been briefed on the situation in the U.K. Continuing to monitor and update — Sean Spicer (@PressSec) March 22, 2017

The shots heard fired in the vicinity of the palace are understood to have been by armed police.

A witness within the parliamentary estate told Breitbart London: “We’re locked in the office at the moment, waiting to find out what’s going on. Looking out the window, I can see Westminster Bridge, there’s a man on the floor having a blanket put over him, paramedics are just turning up. There are a few paramedics at the Speaker’s end of the bridge. They have been attended to for a while. There are a lot of firearms officers”.

Speaking to British media, Journalist Kevin Schofield said: “We heard a very loud bang outside the press gallery. We heard lost of shouting, there were men running around. Then I looked to my left and someone rushed through gates at Westminster and attacked a policeman.

“Another policeman came and rescued him and the man who assaulted him got up and appeared to be carrying a knife. We heard lots of gunfire. Five or six rounds.”

The White House continues to distance President Donald Trump from former campaign manager Paul Manafort as the Associated Press reported more details of his paid work for Russian interests.

“It would be inappropriate for us to comment on a person who is not a White House employee,” Sean Spicer told reporters Wednesday morning.

The Associated Press revealed a 2005 memo to Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally, proposing a plan to influence the United States in favor of Russian interests. Manafort signed a $10 million annual contract in 2006 with Deripaska.

Manafort denies representing Russian political interests as part of the contract.

“I worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments,” Manafort said. “My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests.”

Manafort was an unpaid campaign manager for Donald Trump from March — August 2016, resigning two days after Breitbart News executive chair Steve Bannon was hired to manage the campaign.

On Monday, Spicer told reporters that Manafort “played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time” in the campaign.

When reporters asked him if the White House was aware of any contact between Russian operatives, Spicer replied, “No.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af6a979b8:6880ee:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

BRUSSELS (AP) — Brussels International Airport, where 16 people died in two bomb attacks on March 22, 2016, looks shiny new. The Maelbeek subway station, where another 16 died from a backpack bomb, processes commuters much as it always has. And tourism is recovering, despite Donald Trump calling the Belgian capital a “hellhole” that should be avoided at all costs.

One year after the attacks, the city’s physical scars may have healed, but the pain is apparent beneath the surface. Still, the city’s residents and authorities are determined to find a way to forge ahead, without changing the character of one of the world’s most international cities.

“Killing innocent people was really dramatic for everyone, but we have also seen very positive signs of the human beings, the solidarity, people helping each other out,” said Arnaud Feist, Brussels Airport CEO, in an interview with The Associated Press.

Yet surveillance is up almost everywhere. The city and Belgium as a whole continue to live at the second-highest terror level, meaning there is a serious threat of an attack.

Even if the locals in Brussels are mostly oblivious to heavily armed paratroopers patrolling the city’s landmarks, visitors still stop in their tracks when they notice the camouflage dress and the machine guns.

At the airport, authorities “have taken a lot of additional security measures that go well beyond the European regulations,” Feist said.

Normality is still far off on the first anniversary of the attacks, which also wounded more than 300 people.

The social fabric is still especially frayed in the rundown Molenbeek municipality in the center of the city, where several of the extremists who were involved in the Brussels attack or the November 2015 Paris attacks had lived or grown up. The area, which has a large immigrant community, was portrayed as jihadi central and Europe’s hotbed of fundamentalism, and is still far from recovering from the stigma.

“It’s a fact that there really was Molenbeek-bashing after the Paris attacks,” said the city’s mayor, Francoise Schepmans. The facts about rampant crime on some streets and unfettered religious extremism in some mosques and a Quran school were laid bare. The mayor, with help from national authorities, has started a long cleanup operation.

She has closed some mosques for incendiary language and found that 102 nonprofit organizations had links to illegal activities, some to religious radicalism.

“The work is going to take years before Molenbeek gets a positive image again,” she said.

When a huge, mysterious mural appeared, showing Caravaggio’s “Sacrifice of Isaac” of a struggling child with a blade to his neck awaiting slaughter, it struck a chord.

“A super-violent beheading scene on the edge of Molenbeek,” said Brussels alderwoman Ans Persoons. “We didn’t want it to raise tensions,” and the debate is still continuing over whether to paint over the mural.

Overall, it makes it tough for a city to bounce back, especially one that relies on its tourism industry.

Before the attacks, said Patrick Bontinck, CEO of the Visit Brussels tourist office, “tourism was growing approximately 10 percent each year since five years. We were in a really good situation.”

The devastation that destroyed the main arrivals hall at the airport and ripped through the Maelbeek subway line had an immediate impact. “We had a drop of approximately from 30 to 40 percent in just two or three days after the attack,” Bontinck said.

Hotels and restaurants were hit hard, and despite help from the authorities, some were pushed into bankruptcy.

It took a ripple effect for people to come back. First, tourists from the neighboring countries returned, then other Europeans, and now tourists from across the world are starting to see Brussels as a viable destination again.

“It took us about six months to get the traffic back as we normally had,” airport CEO Feist said. “We had traffic records in November, December and even January this year.”

For Bontinck, it is important not to lose the global feel of the city. The International Organization for Migration says 62 percent of the population of Brussels is foreign-born, second only to Dubai. After the Paris attacks with its Brussels connection, future U.S. President Donald Trump described the city as “like living in a hellhole right now” because of its lack of integration.

Bontinck still bristles.

“We are the second-most cosmopolitan city in the world and we want to keep our value of sharing, people of all nationalities living together,” he said. “Maybe Mr. Trump doesn’t like this, but this is our value and we want to continue to share this with all of the world.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af6044ce7:568682:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump announced his first federal appeals court nomination on Tuesday, naming Amul R. Thapar of Kentucky to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

Thapar currently serves on the District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. The White House released news of the appointment which noted that President George W. Bush nominated Thapar in 2008 which led to his confirmation and appointment. The son of Indian-American immigrants, he was the first Article III judge of South Asian descent in the U.S.

Prior to becoming a judge, Thapar served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky and Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Ohio and the District of Columbia according to the White House.

Thapar has worked for both Williams &amp; Connolly in Washington, D.C. and Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey in Cincinnati during his time in private practice according to the National Law Journal. He has ruled on multiple notable cases including one in 2016 in which he ruled against restrictions on judges’ political involvement. He stated that the Kentucky Judicial Conduct Commission rules violated the First Amendment.

The Journal called Thapar a “well-respected in Kentucky, and known as a thoughtful, fair judge and a strong writer.” The report referenced a 2010 ruling in which he left in place Labor Department injunction against an energy company for coal mine safety violations. It also noted a 2015 ruling against a store manager who lost his sight and filed suit against Sherwin-Williams. His decision stated that vision was a key function of the job which involved driving to customers.

Judge Thapar attended Boston College where he earned a B.S. in 1991 and went on to earn his J.D. at the University of California, Berkeley.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald Trump’s administration is ready “to be more engaged” and take terrorism in the Middle East head on, proclaimed the prime minister of war-ravaged Iraq when asked if the commander-in-chief’s approach to defeating the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) is different than his predecessor’s.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suggested a commitment to combating jihadist groups should not only involve the use of military force through the deployment of a vast number of American troops, noting, “There are better ways for defeating terrorism and I think we can do it.”

During a discussion hosted by the American taxpayer-funded think-tank U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) shortly after he visited the White House Monday, PM Haider declared when comparing Trump’s efforts to annihilate ISIS with those of Barack Obama:

I think this administration wants to be more engaged in fighting terrorism and I can sense a difference in terms of being head-to-head with terrorism. I think they’re prepared to do more to fight terrorism, to be more engaged. […] I don’t think now the public opinion, especially in the U.S. and in other places, would encourage sending troops in large numbers. So I think terrorism — you don’t defeat it by military force only. There are better ways for defeating terrorism, and I think we can do it.

The Shiite PM conceded that he had not seen the Trump administration’s specific plan to wipe out ISIS.

“To be honest, I haven’t seen a full plan. I know there’s a plan,” said Abadi, adding that Iraq has its own strategy.

Nevertheless, he said the entire Middle East “region must have a plan to wipe out terrorism.”

The Iraqi leader pointed out that the various Muslim-majority countries, including some covered by Trump’s revised executive order (EO) restricting immigration, are a hotbed for terrorist activities. “In our world, in the region, there are many terrorist activities… in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Libya, and other areas. Yemen as well. So I think we have to stay focused on this,” he told the audience at the USIP event Monday.

“In our world, in the region, there are many terrorist activities… in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Libya, and other areas. Yemen as well. So I think we have to stay focused on this,” he told the audience at the USIP event Monday.

President Trump’s EO limits immigration from six terror-linked countries — Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen.

“We have to remove terrorism from being used in the region of conflict,” proclaimed PM Abadi, adding, “Daesh [ISIS] was not spontaneous. It was not just born overnight” in Iraq and Syria.

The Iraqi prime minister said that the U.S.-backed local forces in Iraq are close to pushing ISIS out of the country, particularly from the Nineveh province’s city of Mosul, believed to be the group’s last remaining stronghold in the nation.

“We are at the last stage of liberating the whole of Nineveh and after that liberating the whole of Iraq from Daesh [ISIS],” said Abadi.

Although ISIS is close to defeat, ISIS is still receiving funds and foreign fighters, warned the prime minister.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af6044ce7:56867a:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Tattoo removals have skyrocketed in San Francisco, as illegal aliens fear body markings may tie them to foreign criminal gangs and make them a target for immigration officials.

With increased deportations for illegal immigrants, at least one tattoo removal shop has seen its clientele double since the President Donald Trump’s victory in November.

Nora Ruiz with the San Pablo Economic Development Corporation said the increased need for tattoo removal is because illegal immigrants do not want to be seen as associates to foreign criminal gangs like MS-13, which is notorious for its inked members.

“A lot of people don’t want to be a moving target or even seen as a target,” Ruiz told KPIX 5. “And for fear that they might be seen as a certain type of person or judged in anyway, people want to get their tattoos removed.”

The news comes as Daniel Ramirez Medina of Mexico, 23, who was previously protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after it was revealed that he had ties to a criminal gang, Breitbart Texas reported.

Theodore Chuang, the Federal District Judge for the District of Maryland who halted most elements of President Trump’s latest executive order temporarily banning travel from six Middle Eastern countries, as well as refugees from all countries, served as deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2014.

His March 15 ruling in the case, International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) v.Trump, in which DHS, the State Department, and President Trump are defendants, raises legitimate questions about whether he should have recused himself from hearing the case in the first place.

Title 28, Part I, Chapter 21, Section 455 (a) “Disqualification of justice, judge, or magistrate judge” of the U.S. Code Annotated reads as follows: (28 U.S. Code § 455 )

Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.

The Public Advisory Opinions concerning ethical standards of federal judges offer little further guidance on this particular standard.

As former deputy general counsel at DHS under an administration that pursued policies that are diametrically opposed to those of President Trump, it is not surprising that many legal scholars and political commentators have written articles which, taken as a whole, suggest that the impartiality of Judge Chuang’s March 15 ruling “might reasonably be questioned.”

They also criticized a similar ruling handed down on the same day by another Obama appointee, Federal District Judge Derrick Watson, in Hawaii.

“Two federal judges, both nominated by President Barack Obama, have issued injunctions against President Donald Trump’s revised executive order temporarily restricting travel from six terrorist safe havens in the Middle East and Africa,” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, wrote recently at The Daily Signal:

The decisions by Derrick Kahala Watson in Hawaii and Theodore David Chuang in Maryland should shock no one—not because the judges are correct, but because their decisions follow the same pattern as prior decisions in Washington state and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals over the first order. These rulings ignore or misinterpret federal immigration law that gives the president the clear authority to act and prior Supreme Court precedents that support the legality of the president’s actions.

“Judge Chuang’s ruling on Trump’s executive order should be viewed as a continuation of his service to the Democratic party, including his role in stonewalling Congress’ investigation of the Benghazi attacks, and to the cause of ‘social justice.’ With judges as unprincipled as Chuang, his Hawaii counterpart, and the leftists who dominate the Ninth Circuit, one wonders whether the rule of law has a future in America,” respected attorney Paul Mirengoff wrote at Powerline Blog:

Chuang came here to work in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department — ground zero for left-wing activism in government. Before that, he clerked for a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — ground zero for left-wing judicial activism. It is the Ninth Circuit, of course, that ruled against Trump’s original immigration/travel order, and that planted the seed for the absurd argument that the order somehow violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. You have to hand it to the leftists. They know how to shop for judges.

Even legal scholars affiliated with the liberal Brookings Institute posed serious questions about the March 15 decisions from Chuang in Maryland and Watson in Hawaii.

“We don’t mean here to do an exhaustive legal analysis of either court’s work. But suffice it to say that you don’t have to be a Trumpist to have questions,” Benjamin Wittes and Quinta Jurecic wrote at the Lawfare Blog.

“To put the matter bluntly: why are so many judges being so aggressive here?” they asked:

The legal disputes are both interesting and important. But this meta-legal question strikes us, at least, as far more important and far-reaching. And we think the answer lies in judicial suspicion of Trump’s oath. The question goes to the manner in which we can expect the judiciary to interact with President Trump on this and other issues throughout his presidency. It goes, not to put too fine a point on it, to the question of whether the judiciary means to actually treat Trump as a real president or, conversely, as some kind of accident—a person who somehow ended up in the office but is not quite the President of the United States in the sense that we would previously have recognized.

Or, as famed Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz put it, “If Obama had issued the very same order with the same words it would be constitutional,” in the rulings of Judge Chuang and Judge Watson.

“That’s not the way the law is supposed to operate,” he said Saturday on Fox and Friends:

I actually said that this wasn’t constitutional analysis. It was psychoanalysis. There is precedent in extreme cases where legislators in enacting a statute say things that you can sometimes look to the legislative intent. But I have never heard of a case where the rhetoric of a candidate, ambiguous rhetoric to be sure — because I do not believe this is a Muslim ban —focusing on a country like Iran, the greatest exporter of terrorism, not only no vetting, it sends terrorists out in order to kill Americans. Iran has so much blood on its hands of Americans and American allies, to exclude a country like Iran from the list would be absurd. And the list —although for a different purpose — was originally designed by President Obama. So how can you say that the exclusion of six countries on the list was motivated by what Mr. Trump said when he was candidate Trump? That is not good legal analysis. I’m putting my reputation on the line—I predict the case gets to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will uphold the major provisions of this ban.

“Judges using campaign rhetoric to infer intent instead of plainly evaluating the law as written is a dangerous development. Also because the public can witness the selective use of this trick, it undermines confidence in the judiciary at a time when the judiciary can’t afford too much erosion of trust,” Mollie Hemingway wrote at The Federalist.

“Regardless of one’s views on the particulars of this executive order and its efficacy, the ability to determine who can enter the country is one of the most obvious and important sovereign decisions a people makes. That power is vested in the executive branch and should not be enjoined by rogue judges. Unelected and unaccountable judges ignoring the law in favor of their feelings is a threat to self-government and rule of law. It needs to stop,” Hemingway concluded.

Some legal experts Breitbart News spoke with say that Judge Chuang was not legally required to recuse himself since his service at DHS ended in 2014, three years before the case was filed, and that no one has yet found any public statements he made previously that would indicate bias in favor of the plaintiffs — refugee advocates and a voluntary agency paid by the federal government to resettle refugees — or against the defendants, President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of State.

As for Chuang’s public record at the Department of Homeland Security, we know that he was temporarily assigned to assist the State Department in covering up its handling of the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.

That work led Sen. Chuck Grassley to vigorously object to Chuang’s confirmation by the Senate in 2014.

“The Senate confirmed four of President Obama’s executive and judicial nominees Thursday. Theodore Chuang and George Hazel will serve as U.S. district judges for Maryland. The Senate voted 53-42 on Chuang’s nomination and 95-0 on Hazel’s,” The Hill reported in May 2014:

Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said he couldn’t support Chuang’s nomination because he helped the Obama administration “stonewall” Congress on the investigation of the death of four Americans at the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. “I can’t support his nomination because of the central role Mr. Chuang played in the administration’s efforts to stonewall an investigation into the situation in Benghazi,” Grassley said. “These questions remain unanswered because the administration refuses to recognize the rights of congressional oversight.” Chuang provided legal counsel to the State Department and Department of Homeland Security.

Breitbart News posed three questions about Judge Chuang’s decision not to recuse himself in this case to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts:

(1) Did Judge Chuang’s failure to recuse himself from hearing the IRAP v Trump Complaint constitute a violation of 28 U.S. Code § 455 section (a) “disqualification of justice, judge, or magistrate judge”?

(2) Should Judge Chuang recuse himself from IRAP v Trump going forward? (3) Will the U.S. Courts require Judge Chuang to recuse himself from IRAP v Trump going forward?

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts did not respond to these three questions, but did offer this on Tuesday morning:

“You may find the following advisory opinion helpful. Here’s the link and it’s also copied below, it’s Cannon 3C (e),” a spokesperson for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts tells Breitbart News:

The link, the spokesperson subsequently confirmed, is not to an advisory opinion, but instead simply the same Statutory Code referenced earlier in this article.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af4828b4a:3728a3:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Barack Obama’s last-minute decision to repeal the executive policy known as “Wet Foot/Dry Foot” has deterred many, but not all, Cuban nationals seeking refuge in the United States. According to the U.S. Coast Goard, dozens of Cubans have attempted the escape since their rights in the U.S. were no longer guaranteed.

Capt. Aldante Vinciguerra, chief of response for the Coast Guard 7th District, told the Associated Press that authorities had apprehended 65 Cuban nationals on the high seas since the day President Obama announced that Cubans would no longer receive political asylum in the United States automatically, January 12. Most will be repatriated, and 27 already have, according to Martí Noticias. That outlet notes that another 52 Cubans were detained in U.S. ports of entry between January 12 and mid-March as an extra precaution to implement the policy.

The repeal of Wet Foot/Dry Foot does not mean Cubans cannot appeal their deportation, citing a material risk of political persecution at home. Cuba is a communist dictatorship notorious for flagrant human rights abuses against Christians, political dissidents, and professionals enlisted in the nation’s $8-million-a-year medical slave trade. Those who are fleeing Cuba due to the extreme poverty and lack of economic opportunity on the island created by decades of reliance on the Soviet Union and communist mismanagement do not benefit from this exception.

“We discourage anyone from taking to the sea and attempting to reach U.S. soil illegally,” Vinciguerra told the AP. “They are risking their lives with very little chance of success.”

The number of Cuban nationals attempting to flee to the United States had increased dramatically between 2014 and January 2017 as a direct response to President Obama’s “normalization” policy towards Cuba, which called for the acceptance of dictator Raúl Castro and economic rapprochement with his regime.

The Coast Guard documented a 117-percent increase in the number of Cubans intercepted trying to reach the United States on makeshift nautical vessels between December 2013 and December 2014, when President Obama announced the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Castro. Upon being caught, Coast Guard officials reported that Cubans were increasingly taking to harming themselves, including instances of Cubans drinking from gallon jugs of bleach to avoid being sent back to Cuba.

While the Associated Press reported an increase in violence on the part of Cuban refugees at the time, they failed to note that the violent acts were largely acts of self-harm.

The Coast Guard report arrives on the anniversary of President Obama’s visit to Cuba in March 2016. Cuban-American legislators in Congress condemned President Obama this week for implementing a policy that has resulted in an increase in state violence and repression against pro-democracy dissidents. According to Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, “around 16,000 arrests have occurred in Cuba between last year and 2016, and nearly 90,000 Cubans have abandoned the regime en route to the U.S. coast since December 2014.”

Martí quotes Ros-Lehtinen as describing Obama’s approach as a “failed policy.” Agreeing with her was fellow Florida Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, who told reporters, “these two years have been disastrous for the aspirations of freedom of the Cuban people.” He cited violence against women by Cuban police as a human rights violation of particular concern, given the weekly beatings and arrests of the members of the Ladies in White dissident group.

Obama’s policies also left thousands of Cubans stranded throughout Latin America as the “Wet Foot/Dry Foot” policy allowed Central American nations to help Cuban nationals reach their families in Florida. Panama, Costa Rica, and Mexico have been particularly troubled by streams of thousands of Cubans seeking an escape from communism.

Those stranded have argued that President Obama repealed the executive policy as a response to the Cuban-American community’s longtime support of the Republican Party. Cuban voters largely supported current President Donald Trump during the November 2016 election. “Obama, because he is leaving, suddenly takes up the idea of repealing a law that has been enforced for many years and has favored many Cubans. I think he got angry with the Cubans — it is a reprisal,” Jose Enrique Manresa, a 47-year-old Cuban stranded in Mexico, told the BBC in January.

Unlike President Obama, President Trump has repeatedly condemned the Castro regime, using the occasion of Fidel Castro’s death to condemn the “brutal dictator” and calling for a shift in policy away from the Obama administration’s. Both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer have stated President Trump is seeking a full revision of the U.S.’s Cuba policy.

The Trump administration has done nothing to aid Cubans stranded by the abrupt repeal of “Wet Foot/Dry Foot,” however, and has not moved to shut down the newly reopened U.S. Embassy in Cuba or the Cuban embassy in Washington, D.C., the latter of which many in the Cuban-American community have condemned as a base for espionage.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af4828b4a:3728a2:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

North Korea’s latest propaganda video is filled with rocket launchers, jet fighters, military parades, and the money shot of a U.S. aircraft carrier photoshopped to be on fire.

The UK Telegraph reports the clip was released over the weekend, in coordination with North Korea testing a new high-thrust rocket engine. South Korean analysts believe this test represented a significant step toward accurate multi-stage intercontinental ballistic missiles, although North Korea is still thought to be several years away from delivering nuclear warheads with such weapons.

According to the Telegraph, the aircraft carrier seen in the photo is the USS Carl Vinson, which is participating in joint drills with South Korea and Japan. The overheated narrator of the video promises that “a knife will be stabbed into the throat of the carrier.”

When the video switches to an equally cheesy depiction of a B-1B bomber on fire, the narrator shrieks, “The bomber will fall from the sky after getting hit by a hail of fire.”

Reuters reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration is “considering sweeping sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system as part of a broad review of measures to counter Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile threat.”

“The sanctions would be part of a multi-pronged approach of increased economic and diplomatic pressure – especially on Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with North Korea – plus beefed-up defenses by the United States and its South Korean and Japanese allies, according to the administration official familiar with the deliberations,” Reuters adds.

According to the report, President Trump wants plans on his desk before his scheduled summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April. The State Department has been quietly informing China that expanded sanctions against banks that do business with Pyongyang would hit a large number of Chinese financial institutions. Small Chinese banks have been crucial in helping North Korea conduct illicit commerce to evade sanctions.

A stronger display of military force is said to be part of the policy mix, although probably not direct military action. Interestingly, Reuters suggests expanded cyber warfare and “covert action aimed at undermining North Korea’s leadership” could be an element of the plan.

On Tuesday afternoon, a North Korean envoy said Pyongyang does not fear broader U.S. sanctions and will pursue “acceleration” of both its nuclear missile and ICBM programs, including nuclear first strike capability.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af44b5743:334053:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security ordered a ban on electronic devices in the passenger cabins of nine airlines flying into the U.S. from eight Middle Eastern countries.

While some critics reflexively attacked the ban as an irrational order from the Trump administration, it was soon revealed that solid intelligence of potential threats motivated the ban, and other countries began following America’s lead.

CNN lists the ten affected airports as: Cairo, Egypt; Dubai and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Istanbul, Turkey; Doha, Qatar; Amman, Jordan; Kuwait City; Casablanca, Morocco; and Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Nine airlines are affected: Egyptair, Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, Kuwait Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, and Turkish Airlines.

A senior U.S. official told CNN that if any of these airlines choose not to comply, “we will work with the FAA to pull their certificate and they will not be allowed to fly to the United States.” Most of the listed airlines appear to be complying with the order. In fact, Royal Jordanian Airlines announced the ban in a Twitter message before the U.S. government issued its official statement.

Sky News estimates the order will apply to about 50 flights per day.

The ban prevents passengers from carrying electronic devices larger than cell phones on inbound flights from the listed airports, with exceptions made for medical devices. Outbound flights to those destinations are not affected.

“The US Government is concerned about terrorists’ ongoing interest in targeting commercial aviation, including transportation hubs over the past two years. Evaluated intelligence indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation, to include smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items,” DHS said in a statement.

Sky News reports Turkey promptly objected to the order. “We particularly emphasize how this will not benefit the passenger and that reverse steps or a softening should be adopted,” said Transport Minister Ahmet Arslan.

“Officials said the new directive was not based on information pointing to a credible, specific threat of an imminent attack. Instead, it reflected a new consensus among American intelligence agencies that terrorist groups such as the Islamic State or the Al Qaeda franchise in Yemen are increasingly trying to find ways to smuggle explosive devices hidden in electronic devices, like laptops,” writes the New York Times.

These officials did not say how long the ban was expected to remain in effect, or whether it might be expanded to include other airports. The Washington Post, however, talked to a DHS spokesman who said the directive will be in effect until October 14 and may be extended for another year beyond that if “the evaluation of the threat remains the same.”

The Times decided to quote irate Egyptian lawmaker and journalist Osama Sharshar claiming that President Trump issued the order to “please the right-wing extremists in America,” even though New York Times writers were already well aware that other countries are following suit, beginning with the United Kingdom.

Hours after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced its ban on electronic devices, the U.K. issued a similar order covering all inbound flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia. The U.K. order covers fewer countries but more airports, and 14 airlines in total. The Washington Post reports that the British ban also covers “some cellphones.”

The Post indicates that the decision to issue this ban was made during a meeting on aviation security measures held by Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday and was based on “the same intelligence the U.S. relies on,” according to a May spokesman.

On Tuesday afternoon, the BBC reported that Canada is also “considering restrictions on electronics in the cabins of planes.”

Aviation Security editor-in-chief Philip Baum told the BBC he thought the device ban was tantamount to an admission by American and British authorities that their screening procedures for devices such as laptop computers are inadequate. He also suggested the ban could be counterproductive because checking such electronics into the luggage hold of an aircraft makes them more challenging to inspect.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af42fd85a:30231b:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Club for Growth announced a half-million-dollar ad campaign urging ten members of Congress to oppose Speaker Paul Ryan’s American Health Care Act, also known as RyanCare.

Club for Growth president David McIntosh said:

The RyanCare bill fails to keep President Trump’s promises of interstate competition and health insurance deregulation. Republicans promised a bill that would stop Obamacare’s taxes and mandates and replace them with free-market reforms that will increase health insurance competition and drive down costs. RyanCare fails on those counts, and that’s why the Club is letting millions of constituents know that their Representative should reject RyanCare.

The Club for Growth applauds recent changes in the RyanCare bill that would allow states to block grant Medicaid and expand protection for older Americans.

Now that the 49ers want nothing to do with him, it appears that the liberal sports media sympathizes with quarterback Colin Kaepernick and advocates that some NFL team should sign him to a new contract.

Mike Florio writes at NBC Sports PFT that although Kaepernick may not, as Ron Jaworski once claimed, have the potential to “become one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time,” he deserves a chance “to show what he can still do.”

Florio agrees with Doug Lesmerises of the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the Cleveland Browns should give the QB, who refused to stand for the National Anthem last season, a chance. The blame lies with Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, Florio argues, because he is a Republican with ties to the Jeb Bush for president campaign and he is the brother of Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, without considering that management might be considering their fan base or that Kaepernick just isn’t that good.

Florio doesn’t seem to remember the Isaiah Crowell ordeal. The Cleveland Browns running back posted an Instagram pic last year of a cop getting murdered by a terrorist and appeared to “advocate the knifing of police officers,” which caused the Cleveland Police Union president to actually threaten to pull security from Browns games. Crowell eventually apologized. Kaepernick might be an especially bad fit in a town already weary of his anti-cop stance.

Moreover, Florio criticizes New York Jets Owner Woody Johnson for having the same “mindset” as Haslam. Johnson, appointed by President Trump as Ambassador to the United Kingdom, would never employ Kaepernick. That’s because, despite their current search for a quarterback, his new boss already voiced disdain for Kaepernick’s lack of respect for the American Flag and the nation’s police officers. Trump said of Kaepernick’s antics, “Maybe he should find a country that works better for him.”

Florio seems incredulous, saying, “The fact that no one has even brought him in for a visit suggests that something more than football is influencing the process.”

Why is it that Florio only points the finger at conservative owners for denying Kaepernick a place on the roster? Why not go after Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, who contributed handsomely to the Hillary Clinton campaign? Yet, instead of signing Kaepernick, Lurie re-signs the white Nick Foles. Why isn’t he under scrutiny?

The Rooneys own the Steelers, and one of them served as Obama’s ambassador to Ireland. With Ben Roethlisberger musing about retirement, why haven’t they brought Kaepernick in yet, if only for a look?

As Hamlet’s Marcellus might have said, “Something is rotten in the land of sports media.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af4145b4d:2e930a:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

During Judge Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) asked Gorsuch about remarks made by President Donald Trump’s Chief of Staff Reince Preibus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon at the recent Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) conference in D.C. about plans for the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”

“Mr. Priebus [said] your nomination was central to President Trump’s fulfilling his policy objectives, quote, ‘Neil Gorsuch represents a type of judge that has a vision of President Trump, and it,’ — referring to your nomination — ‘fulfills the promise that he made to all of you,’ speaking to the conservative activists gathered at CPAC,” Franken said. “What do you think that Mr. Priebus was talking about?”

“Respectfully, Senator, Mr. Priebus doesn’t speak for me and I don’t speak for him,” Gorsuch said. “I don’t appreciate when people characterize me, as I’m sure you don’t appreciate when people characterize you.

“I like to speak for myself,” Gorsuch said. “I am a judge.

“I am my own man,” Gorsuch added.

Franken then pressed Gorsuch about Bannon’s remarks at CPAC.

“I want to get back to the panel at CPAC,” Franken said. “After Mr. Priebus discussed your nomination, Steve Bannon talked about the president’s agenda,” Franken said. “He described three priorities; one of them was, quote, ‘The deconstruction of the administrative state.’”

“Here’s what Mr. Bannon meant by that,” Franken said. “He said that regulation was a problem from his perspective and, quote, ‘Every business leader we’ve had in is saying not just taxes but it is also regulation.’”

“He said that if you look at the President’s appointees, quote, ‘They were selected for a reason and that is deconstruction,’” Franken said. “The way the progressive left runs is if they can’t get it passed [in legislation] they’re just going to put in some sort of regulation in an agency.&apos;”

“Taking Steve Bannon at his word, do you think only Cabinet appointees were selected to bring about this deconstruction or do you think the White House also sees a role here for its judicial nominees?” Franken asked Gorsuch.

“Senator, respectfully, I believe that’s a question best directed to Mr. Bannon,” Gorsuch replied.

The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to continue Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing for two more days.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af3f8c0de:2bbbac:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared Tuesday that his deputies will block U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from entering New York City public schools — even though agency officials say they are not pursuing illegal immigrants in schools.

“We will not allow ICE agents to threaten that protection, disrupt classes or take any action that would be detrimental to our students,” de Blasio said at a press conference held outside New York’s Tweed Courthouse Tuesday afternoon. “With these updated guidelines, we are reinforcing the fact that a school is a safe and protected location,” he said, adding that his promise would not apply if ICE got a court order.

“We think it’s crucial to fight for all New Yorkers and to help immigrant New Yorkers to know their rights,” declared De Blasio, who is facing reelection in November. “This is your city. Your city will stand by you.”

When asked if they have been any incidents of ICE agents detaining any student or their parents at any of the city’s school, de Blasio said no, but emphasized the guidelines as a precautionary measure since “there is a strong fear” of Trump’s immigration enforcement plan.

“We want to be very clear to parents that we’re not allowing ICE agents in the building because I think parents are so afraid right now,” de Blasio said. “They’re worried that an agent could literally come into the building and single out their child. I know it sounds outlandish, but we’re seeing things that we have not seen before and there’s a tremendous amount of fear out there. We have to be ready for anything.”

The ICE spokeswoman in New York’s field office, Rachael Yong Yow, said schools are considered a “sensitive location,” along with churches and hospital centers, where agents are required to get prior approval from a supervisor before picking someone up for repatriation.

A November 2014 report by the New York Post estimated the state has a population of 35o,000 illegal-alien students. Their illegal immigrant parents work throughout the city, mostly in jobs where employers want cheap employees, and they spend tens of billions of dollars each year at local businesses.

The announcements were part of a series of events coordinated by liberal mayors in cities across the country by the U.S. Conference of Mayors for a “Cities Day of Immigration Action.” Protesting President Donald Trump’s stepped-up enforcement, mayors across the country are making a public show of their support so-called “sanctuary cities.”

“Specifically, concerns about possible federal action that would penalize cities financially for their policies toward immigrants and lead to increased deportation of immigrants,” the Conference of Mayors’ website reads. “With the January 28 issuance of an executive order halting admission to the United States of refugees and other immigrants, mayors and the Conference focused attention on these issues as well.”

New York is the ultimate city of immigrants. I want to send a clear message to our immigrant families: this is your city. #MayorsStand4All pic.twitter.com/qJztNuTu1E — Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 21, 2017

According to de Blasio’s new protocol, ICE agents will not be allowed to enter a school unless they provide a warrant and wait outside the school until school employees consult with the Department of Education attorney. If the ICE agent appears without a warrant, de Blasio is instructing the school to call the NYPD.

“This adds another layer of defense so that it’s quite clear if an agent shows up, the default position is they’re not coming in the building,” de Blasio said. “ICE agents will not be wandering the halls of a school. Legal staff from the DOE and/or Law Department have to get involved, the principal has to get involved, senior police officials have to get involved before any decision is made on how to proceed.”

De Blasio also added the Department of Education does not track the immigration status of students and will not provide any student information unless required to by law.

The city plans to offer workshops called “Know Your Rights” and other political programs as “Make the Road NY,” to keep students and their families informed of the city’s new added plan. Also, those seeking legal assistance will obtain free immigration services, courtesy of ActionNYC, a taxpayer-funded immigration legal services program.

City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito called the new guidelines a reflection of the “city’s values of fairness and justice,” adding that Trump’s policies are “racist.”

“This guideline states clearly and unambiguously ICE can’t come in without a warrant signed by a judge, period,” Mark-Viverito said. “We support restricting ICE’s access to schools, students, and student records—because classrooms should be safe spaces to learn in. Policies like this not only reflect the city’s values of fairness and justice but they also underscore the importance of ensuring that our schools remain safe spaces for our children.”

Mark-Viverito added, “This talk from this administration, that they’re only focused on those that are hurting our communities is not true — it’s a lie, it’s a dragnet approach, a racist policy that is being implemented by this administration and is focused in particular on communities of color.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af3f8c0de:2bbbaa:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Partial transcript as follows:

GRAHAM: Now, about what’s going on in the country with President Trump, whether you like him or you don’t, he is the president, but you have said several times that he is not above the law as president. Is that correct?

GORSUCH: Yes, senator.

GRAHAM: You told Senator Leahy if there is a law passed that a Muslim could not serve in the military you believe based on current law that would be an illegal act.

GORSUCH: Yes, senator I see that having all sorts of constitutional problems under current law.

GRAHAM: So if we have laws on the book that prevent waterboarding, do you agree with me that the Detainee Treatment Act prevents waterboarding?

GORSUCH: Yes, senator, that’s my recollection of it.

GRAHAM: In case President Trump is watching, which he may very well be, one you did a good job picking Judge Gorsuch. Number two, here is the bad part, if you start waterboarding people you may get impeached. Is that a fair summary?

GORSUCH: Senator, the impeachment power belongs to this body.

GRAHAM: OK that’s even better. Would it be subject to prosecution?

GORSUCH: Senator I’m not going to speculate.

GRAHAM: But no man is above the law.

GORSUCH: No man is above the law. No man.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af3c18d48:279558:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A panel of school administrators are in charge of selecting the professor for the award, which gives the chosen faculty member a chance to speak at Orange Coast College’s commencement ceremony.

The professor in question, Olga Perez Stable-Cox, declined the award for an unspecified reason, according to Doug Bennet, executive director of college advancement at OCC.

Even though Cox turned down the award, some people at the school think the faculty’s decision to nominate her was wrong in the first place, given what she said last semester.

“The fact that the faculty chose professor Cox for the faculty member of the year award speaks volumes to how blind they are about what she did last semester,” said Joshua Recalde-Martinez, president-emeritus of OCC’s College Republicans group.

On Saturday, campus police discovered graffiti targeting the OCC College Republicans and Recalde-Martinez.

“Doxx Joshua Martinez OCC Young Republicans = Fascists,” one graffiti message read, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Recalde-Martinez says that Cox probably did not accept the nomination because of these recent events.

“She understood the impact that accepting the nomination could have on the campus climate, and that is why she refused,” Recalde-Martinez said.

Recalde-Martinez’s group is the same group responsible for posting the video of Cox’s comments on Facebook.

In her comments, Cox blamed the Electoral College for Trump’s win and and said that the “act of terrorism” was committed by someone “among us.”

“It’s an act of terrorism. One of the most frightening things for me, and most people in my life, is that the people committing the assault are among us,” Cox said.

The college recently rescinded the suspension of the student who recorded Cox in class.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af38a6258:1f97b8:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Business advocates who want to import more foreign consumers and more foreign workers are developing plans to counter President Donald Trump’s popular call for a merit-based immigration reform.

The emerging strategy is to pair offers of minor concessions to Americans and Trump with demands for giveaways to business, including a bigger supply of low-wage workers and welfare-funded consumers. The immigration “pairing” strategy is being pushed by the industry-backed Business Policy Council, in cooperation with GOP Sen. Thom Tillis.

The strategy collides with Trump’s emphasis on raising Americans’ wages via “merit-based immigration,” which is also backed by a new productivity-boosting immigration drafted by two GOP Senators, David Perdue and Tom Cotton. “Real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws,” Trump told Congress February 28.

The business push for “pairing” creates a risk for the many Americans worried about cheap-labor migration, said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. President Trump “has the potential to be taken to the cleaners by [Sen.] Chuck Schumer because [immigraton] is something he doesn’t know anything about… hopefully [Steve] Bannon and [Stephen] Miller will prevent this from happening.”

Tillis and lobbyists at the BPC described their emerging “pairing” strategy at a recent press event.

“We have to have border security,” Tillis said in a conversation with Haley Barbour, the co-chair of the BPC’s immigration advocacy task force, who also runs a lobbying firm, the BGR Group. Tillis continued:

To me, it is absolutely essential [border security] be one of the first measures that we pass. Now the question is what can we pair with it that will start creating some sort of consensus going … around a series of other things that we can talk about, but we are not going to put in the [first] bill because if it gets too convoluted, if it becomes too comprehensive, than it starts falling apart.

In 2013, business groups allied with Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer to push a huge “comprehensive immigration reform” bill that provided amnesty and a huge flow of new migrants and workers. Schumer’s “Gang of Eight” bill was defeated because House Speaker John Boehner stalled business groups until public opposition became undeniable.

“Think about [pairing] DACA [President Barack Obama’s 2012 mini-amnesty for young illegals] with border security…. Think about [pairing more] work visas with E-Verify and other enforcement actions against employers,” Tillis said. E-Verify is a federal website that can help screen out illegal during job interviews. However, business lobbying has persuaded Congress to keep the use of E-Verify system voluntary, not mandatory.

E-Verify is a federal website that helps employers identify illegal aliens seeking jobs. However, business lobbying has persuaded Congress to keep the use of E-Verify system voluntary, not mandatory.

Tillis also dismissed Trump’s election-winning promise of a border wall, by suggesting that Congress deny funds for construction of a wall or fence along stretches of the border in favor of “other capabilities.” Border security, he said, “is one of the first things we need to do… [but] it seems to me we could get to a reasonable compromise on a bill that I think will be less costly and more effective than just the concept of a structure. Walls need to be where wall are, but other capabilities need to be elsewhere.”

Barbour and other BPC officials pushed the “pairing” strategy throughout the press event. “The idea of pairing… makes a lot of sense,” said Michael Chertoff, the former Secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush. Chertoff is the co-chair of the BPC’s Immigration Task Force.

Tillis’ office did not respond to Breitbart’s emails. Barbour declined an interview request.

Tillis’s policy goals are shaped by the needs of North Carolina’s agriculture industry, which continues to rely on cheap labor for harvesting crops, instead of developing high-productivity crop harvesting machines.

But he is also indirectly backed by his political neighbor, South Carolina’s Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has repeatedly helped his state’s tourism and golfing resorts bring in wage-cutting foreign workers instead of raising wages to hire Americans. In a March 15 interview with Bloomberg, Graham echoed Barbour’s pairing strategy, saying:

The first one would combine ramped-up enforcement, starting with “the bad dudes,” and the legalization of [DACA] illegal immigrants who came here as minors. Republicans are open to that legalization, he said, and it “would be hard for Democrats to say no to securing the border and helping these 800,000 kids have a better life.” The second one would legalize adult illegal immigrants working in agriculture and tourism, and at the same time require employers to use the e-verify program to make sure all new hires are legal workers. Third, Graham would legalize those remaining illegal immigrants who passed a background check and paid a fine. In return he wants to shift legal immigration toward recruiting people with high skills rather than reuniting extended families. “The immigration system of the future would be merit-based,” he says.

In late 2012, Graham played a key role with Schumer in launching the 2013 “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.

The “pairing” deals sketched by Barbour, Tillis and Graham would allow a border wall plus an amnesty and the expanded work-permit program, which would give Democrats the future voters they want and also give business groups the new inflow of taxpayer-supported customers and wage-cutting white-collar workers that they want. That endless inflow of new workers would make it more difficult for white-collar and blue-collar Americans to win higher salaries as the economy expands.

During the 2016 election campaign, Trump promised to pass a pro-American immigration reform law. “The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists, and powerful, powerful politicians … It does not serve you, the American people,” he said.

“When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages … [but] it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens,” Trump said on August 31, adding:

We have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it’s impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions… While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn’t change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back. And they’re hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances …

The basic problem for reformers is that they “have to get eight Democratic Senators to vote” for a reform, Krikorian said. The offer of a DACA amnesty “might be enough to get eight of those Democrats from Trump-voting states to go along with E-Verify and legal immigration [reform]” which would end the wage-cutting chain immigration of unskilled family relatives, he said. “That would be a good deal,” Krikorian added.

“The worst case is [legislators] legalize the DACAs in exchange for some phony-baloney border bill that they don’t need,” because Congress has already authorized construction of the wall, said Krikorian.

In his February 28 speech to Congress, Trump outlined his “merit-based” immigration reform, which would emphasize skilled immigration of college graduates, and likely lower the annual “family chain” inflow of roughly 800,0000 unskilled relatives of recent immigrants.

Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others –- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families –- including immigrant families –- enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws.

Trump did not say his plan would exclude amnesty or lower the annual inflow of immigrants — but immigration reformers, such as Krikorian, say they would be willing to accept a congressional amnesty if the deal also lowered the annual inflow of legal immigrants which forces down wages and consumer welfare spending.

Under the current cheap-labor economic strategy, the federal government does not repatriate the 11 million illegals, and it grants citizenship to roughly 1 million foreigners per year, mostly to the family relatives of prior unskilled immigrants. Only about one-in-five new immigrants have college degrees. Immigrants without college degrees tend to receive more in welfare and aid payments than they return in federal, state and local taxes. That inflow lowers salaries and wages, which boosts investors’ income by roughly $500 billion per year, according to a Harvard analysis.

The U.S. government also provides temporary work permits to roughly 1 million foreign contract workers, creating a population of roughly 1.4 million temporary white-collar foreign workers in the United States. Tillis and 30 other Senators recently called for agencies to not waste any of the 66,000 H-2B worker visas which companies use to hire foreign workers instead of American workers.

In contrast, Trump has called for pro-American reforms of the contract-worker programs. “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program,” Trump said in a March 2016 statement. “No exceptions,” he added.

Each year, four million Americans enter the workforce and are required to compete for good jobs against the two million new immigrants and temporary workers.

Tillis, however, is focused on pushing his pro-business “pairing” strategy. “We know most of the solutions, we have to figure out … how to silence the voices at either end of the political spectrum that are the reason we haven’t been successful in the past, and solve the problem,” Tillis told the business lobbyists at the March 2 meeting.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af36ea89d:1fda0d:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

An organizer for a safe space event held in response to President Trump’s executive order on immigration refused to speak with a reporter, claiming that doing so would make her feel unsafe.

Last week, online conservative campus watchdog Campus Reform reported on a safe space event that took place at Colgate University on March 9 in response to President Trump’s executive order on immigration.

“If you are interested in speaking up or sharing your emotions and thoughts about the executive order, please feel free to come to Chapel Basement on Thursday, March 9th at 8:30 pm,” the event description read. “This event aims to create a safe, supportive space where people can express feelings about the executive order, listen, and stand in solidarity with those affected.”

Campus Reform reached out to student organizer Woohee Kim, who in response claimed that she wouldn’t “feel safe” sharing information about the event.

Kim was given the Project for Peace Award by Colgate University for her research on the history of violence against women during the Asian and Pacific war.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af36ea89d:1fda0c:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday appealed to conservatives to back the Obamacare replacement bill, after several changes were made.

“Keep in mind if you are a conservative who has been fighting for repeal and replace, this is your chance,” he said at the White House briefing.

He also warned that Republicans who promised health care reform but did not back the bill would “probably pay a price at home.”

“I think there’s going to be a price to be paid. But it’s going to be with their own voters, and they’re going to have to go back and explain to them why they made a commitment to them, and then didn’t follow through,” he said.

The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House on Thursday, but House Freedom Caucus members say the new changes to the bill don’t go far enough, and they remain opposed to the bill.

“At this time, the bill does not have the votes to pass,” Freedom Caucus Communications director Alyssa Farah told Breitbart News on Monday evening, after the new changes were announced.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) needs 216 votes for the bill. If 22 Republicans defect, the bill fails.

The new changes included a work-requirement for those receiving Medicaid, struck out abortion tax credits, and set rules that would make it more difficult for New York State to shift New York City’s Medicaid’s costs onto the rest of the state.

The House Freedom Caucus rejected the changes as too little, too late. They want complete repeal of Obamacare.

President Trump went to the Capitol Tuesday morning to convince skeptical members to support the bill, and plans on talking to more members on Wednesday.

He was reported to have threatened members voting against the bill with primary challenges, but Spicer did not confirm those reports.

“Let’s get through the vote,” he said. “I think one of the things that he made clear this morning was that he was going to make sure that the people who did support this, he would be out there supporting them. And so I’m not going to focus on the negative as much as the positive today.”

Spicer characterized the bill as keeping a promise to voters.

“And this bill, while probably not everybody got everything they wanted, does exactly what we said. It’s repealing it and replacing it with all of the principles and the aspects that we discussed throughout not only last cycle, but in a lot of these cases back to 2010,” Spicer said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af36ea89d:1fda0b:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) told Breitbart News exclusively on Tuesday afternoon that he expects House Speaker Paul Ryan will be forced to pull the American Health Care Act (AHCA) before a scheduled Thursday vote because Ryan will not get the votes to pass the legislation.

The AHCA has been dubbed “Obamacare Lite” by Paul — a leading conservative critic of the plan — and by other conservatives as “RyanCare,” “RINO-Care,” and “Obamacare 2.0,” since the bill does not actually fully repeal Obamacare and keeps many of the main structures that the now-former President Barack Obama installed in the healthcare system. It has come under intense scrutiny from both sides of the Republican Party — moderates and conservatives are lining up against the bill — and Ryan, despite publicly projecting confidence, cannot find the necessary 216 votes to pass the legislation.

Paul, one of the leading senators out of more than a dozen Republicans in the upper chamber criticizing the bill there, told Breitbart News in this exclusive interview he believes there are at least 35 House Republicans ready to vote against the bill in its current form. And he predicted that, unless some major changes come to the legislation between now and the scheduled vote on Thursday, Ryan will need to withdraw the bill and Republicans will have to start from scratch with a new bill and a new strategy on Obamacare.

Paul said in the in-person interview at his U.S. Senate office in the Russell Senate Office Building:

I think there’s easily 35 no votes right now so unless something happens in the next 24 hours, I would predict they pull the bill and start over. I think if conservatives stick together, they will have earned a seat at the table where real negotiation to make this bill an acceptable bill will happen. But it’s interesting what conservatives are doing to change the debate. We went from keeping the Obamacare taxes for a year—hundreds of billions of dollars—but they’re coming towards us because we’re standing firm. So we have to stick together, and if we do stick together there will be a real negotiation on this. The main goal I have is not to pass something that does not fix the situation. If a year from now, insurance rates and premiums are still going through the roof and it’s now a Republican plan it will be a disservice to the president and all of us if we pass something that doesn’t work.

There is plenty of reason to believe that Paul is correct in predicting Ryan does not have the votes to pass this legislation and will need to pull the bill to start over. Despite overtures from President Donald Trump, the House Freedom Caucus members — and particularly its chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) — remain steadfastly opposed to the bill.

NBC News has confirmed at least 26 Republicans who are opposed:

NBC News has now ID&apos;ed 26 House GOPers who are opposed/leaning strongly against House health-care bill, per @AlexNBCNews &amp; @LACaldwellDC pic.twitter.com/lksvwOTw3x — Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) March 21, 2017

But Breitbart News can confirm several more than that are definitely opposed to the legislation. To kill the bill, Republicans need just 21 Republicans opposed—and some are talking about holding a press conference on Wednesday or Thursday with the necessary number of House Republicans to crush RyanCare, appearing arm-in-arm in public opposition before a vote.

House GOP leadership made some last minute changes, too, which Paul — in his interview with Breitbart News — flatly said “no,” were not enough to get the bill passed. Regarding those changed, Paul said:

If you keep all the insurance mandates, and you keep subsidizing insurance, basically it’s Obamacare Lite. So I think it’s still Obamacare Lite. The modifications, some are going in the right direction, but they actually expanded some of the subsidies. So one of the new things about it is it’s actually $75 billion more in subsidies. So, I think they’re stuck trying to split the baby. They’re trying to give conservatives a few token changes. And they’re trying to give the moderates more subsidies.

Paul added that Ryan would not have dragged President Trump into this awful position if he had been more open and inclusive in the process from the beginning. In effect, Paul argued as he has done before, that Ryan is hurting President Trump by doing this the way he is doing it. Paul said:

I’m still unclear as to why they completely ignored conservatives early on in the process and then they had the audacity to look at conservatives and say ‘this is what you all campaigned on.’ That just, frankly, was never true. I was elected in 2010 in the big Tea Party wave that was for repealing Obamacare root and branch, rip the whole thing out. We were for repealing it. I still think that our grassroots conservative supporters are for repealing it. But somewhere along the line, Paul Ryan decided that it wasn’t so much about repealing it but about replacing it with Obamacare Lite. And I think that was a tactical error on their part to think ‘oh, we’ll just be for this and everybody will be for this’ when in reality no conservatives are really for the Ryan plan.

Paul would not say if Ryan will lose the confidence necessary to run the House of Representatives if this bill fails, as some have suggested. When asked if Ryan can still run the House if the bill goes down, Paul told Breitbart News that instead he thinks the bill going down would lead to real negotiations on healthcare reform. He said:

I think what it will be is the real negotiations will begin the moment his bill fails, and when his bill fails conservatives will have a seat at the table. As long as conservatives stay unified and don’t start negotiating one person at a time — what’s a really bad part of negotiations is if everybody starts saying individually ‘oh if you give me this, give me this, give me this’ because then you won’t really fix the main thrust of the bill and the main outcome is that insurance premiums continue to rise and we continue to bail out insurance companies that’s not repeal of Obamacare—that’s Obamacare Lite.

Comedian Roseanne Barr took to Twitter Monday to defend President Donald Trump from unspecified attacks, which she said were really “disguised” attacks on American voters.

“Every single attack on @POTUS is really a disguised attack on American voters who rejected Obama-Clinton-Bush’s bleeding of R treasury,” Barr tweeted.

Every single attack on @POTUS is really a disguised attack on American voters who rejected Obama-Clinton-Bush&apos;s bleeding of R treasury. — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) March 20, 2017

The 64-year-old Roseanne star — whose own 2012 presidential run was the subject of a documentary film — frequently praised Trump during the 2016 race and has continued to defend his presidency on social media.

In June, the comedian told the Hollywood Reporter that the country would be “lucky” if Trump won, “because then it wouldn’t be Hillary.”

“I like Trump because he financed his own [campaign],” Barr said then. “That’s the only way he could’ve gotten that nomination. Because nobody wants a president who isn’t from Yale and Harvard and in the club. ‘Cause it’s all about distribution. When you’re in the club, you’ve got people that you sell to. That’s how money changes hands, that’s how business works. If you’ve got friends there, they scratch your back and blah, blah.”

Last week, Barr spoke out after Palestinian activist and Women’s March organizer Linda Sarsour said it is impossible to be both a pro-Israel Zionist and a feminist.

“Is it even possible to be a pro-Palestinian feminist?” Barr fired back on Twitter.

Barr also announced last week that the cast of her hit 1990s television show was “up for a reunion show.” Roseanne ran for nine seasons between 1988 and 1997 and won three Golden Globe awards.

Tuesday on ABC’s “The View,” while discussing FBI Director James Comey saying Monday he “has no information that supports” President Donald Trump’s tweets accusing former President Barack Obama’s administration of wiretapping Trump Tower prior to the election, co-host Whoopi Goldberg tipped into Trump and said he should apologize to former President Obama because she said, “Nobody wiretapped your ass!”

Goldberg said, “So, yesterday, FBI director James Comey told the House Intelligence Committee there is no information about President Obama wiretapping Trump Tower, wiretapping Trump’s car, wiretapping Trump’s wife.”

She added, “The bottom line is nobody wiretapped your ass! So maybe Sean Spicer, I know you don’t get this, but perhaps an apology to the former commander-in-chief for accusing him of a federal crime, of a felony. The problem for me is when you know you’re wrong when the FBI, CIA, KFC, LMNOP said this didn’t happen and you double down on the lie.”

President Donald Trump signed a bill on Tuesday securing funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), with the aim of sending a crew to Mars within 20 years.

Bill S.442, named the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017, was co-sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), provides NASA with $19.5 billion worth of funding for the 2018 fiscal year, with the aim of sending a “crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s.”

The bill also urges NASA to “extend human presence, including potential human habitation on another celestial body and a thriving space economy in the 21st Century.”

The level of funding is above what Trump outlined in his first White House budget, which called for $19.1 billion investment in NASA programs. It is the first NASA authorization bill to be signed in seven years.

On signing the bill, Trump remarked that “America’s space program has been a blessing to our people and to the entire world.”

“Almost half a century ago our brave astronauts also planted our American flag on the moon. Now, this nation is ready to be the first in space once again. Today we are taking the initial steps toward a bold and bright new future for space exploration,” he continued.

Trump also praised the new high paying jobs the bill will create, as part of his plan to radically reduce unemployment.

Former adult film star Jenna Jameson told Breitbart News exclusively on Tuesday that she is not involved in a forthcoming pornographic film by xHamster.com that is aimed at parodying President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet.

“Completely false. I would call that fake news… or a sad ploy by a company in dire need of publicity for their crap film,” Jameson said.

In a press release on Tuesday, xHamster announced that Jameson was under consideration for a role in the film, which has not yet been named. The lead actor, playing Trump, was announced as “an amateur performer known only John Brutal.”

It also claimed: “Blair Williams has already signed on as Trump’s daughter, Ivanka. xHamster is still casting the other roles, but says it plans to offer Julia Ann the role of Kellyanne Conway, Nina Hartley as Betsy DeVos, Tommy Pistol as Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Ron Jeremy as Steve Bannon, and Jenna Jameson the chance to play herself.”

Jameson, however, vigorously denied any involvement.

The former performer and entrepreneur has been a vocal supporter of Trump, and has also become a prominent supporter of Israel. According to the Jerusalem Post, Jameson recently converted to Orthodox Judaism and may be planning on relocating to Israel with her fiancé, Lior Bitton.

In recent months, Jameson has been an active participant in political debates on Twitter, jousting with liberals and defending conservatives, as well as taking staunchly pro-life positions on abortion.

She has also spoken out against antisemitism after receiving a number of abusive messages via social media.

Update: xHamster responded, via a publicist, to Breitbart News’ report:

[Jameson] didn’t respond to our offer directly, it’s sad to hear that she won’t be involved. After xHamster cast Brutal, we reached out to adult performers who would make up our dream team cabinet, including Jameson, who has been full-throated in her support of President Trump. Blair Williams agreed to play Ivanka. Julia Ann said was interested in playing Kellyanne Conway, and Tommy Pistol Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. This isn’t just a one-off, it’s a four year project, and we’re still looking for our DeVos, our Bannon, or Jameson. We were hoping she’d play herself, but there are plenty of beautiful women who can play her if she won’t.

The global trade winds are blowing in America’s direction again.

Chinese companies are investing in manufacturing plants and expanding operations in the U.S, the Wall Street Journal reports. “Job-creating investment from China is booming,” WSJ columnist Andrew Browne notes.

Several factors are driving the trend. One is a closing wage gap, particularly for skilled workers. Another: industrial land in the U.S. can be cheaper than in the coastal cities of China from which manufacturers can easily ship their product. Lower U.S. energy costs are also playing a role, Browne writes.

The biggest factor, according to Browne, is advanced manufacturing technology–which could curb some of the job-creating power of China’s investments in the U.S. Browne calls Trump’s promise to bring about a manufacturing jobs renaissance “pure fantasy.”

Don’t be so sure. Taken alone, the factors that Browne notices might not be enough to massively revive jobs making and building things in America. But they won’t be “taken alone.” The Trump administrations budget, for example, calls for large cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency–specifically telling the agency to quit funding the implementation of a massive expansion of the administrative state that would have raised energy costs for American consumers and businesses.

At the same time, taxes on imports could push the move from “Made in China” to “Made in the U.S.A.” along even further, as the Wall Street Journal itself noted in an earlier article.

“A hefty U.S. import tax on goods produced in China could accelerate a trend already underway: Chinese companies setting up factories and expanding in the U.S.,” WSJ’s Nina Trenmann wrote in February.

Far from creating the conditions for a trade war, it appears that President Donald Trump’s tough talk on trade is bringing around an end to the quiet trade war waged against American workers for the last two decades. Peace–and jobs–in our time is a real possibility.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af2923b94:a4170:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

California Gov. Jerry Brown cited the disaster relief and infrastructure needs of his state as he told reporters on Monday in Washington, D.C. that there are areas where he is seeking to work with the Trump Administration.

“I find complexity and contradiction very congenial to my bent of mind,” Brown said, in response to questions of whether he felt “conflicted and torn” under pressures to oppose or cooperate with the Trump administration.

Brown met with Federal Emergency Management (FEMA) Agency acting Administrator Bob Fenton on Monday, according to the Sacramento Bee which posted video of Brown’s comments to reporters. Brown has estimated storm damage at over $500 million dollars. On Sunday Brown, sought a fourth federal disaster declaration from President Donald Trump according to KTLA.

Brown was told in the meeting of Trump’s great concern for disaster relief in California. While Brown expressed a positive response to Trump’s words, he did not relent in his criticism of the administration’s choice to review greenhouse gas standards, according to the report.

California is still dealing with the damaged Oroville Dam spillway. Storms have brought welcome water to the drought-stricken state, while at the same time further stressing critical infrastructure.

Brown has continued to slam GOP and Trump administration aims, including the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. But under the pressure of the needs of California, he seemed more willing to work with the administration on Monday.

Asked again about pressure to be the “voice of the resistance,” Brown replied, “I will pursue my own rhetorical paths.”

He continued:

I will do so in the spirit of advancing the interest of California and recognizing that we’re a part of the union and there’s a lot to be, that we’re not going our totally separate way. we are distinct. we have a sovereignty. we will pursue that. but we also have a commonality with other states and with the national government…

Brown said he is seeking to “find common ground” and that he “wouldn’t rule anything out or anything in.”

Brown faces the heavy needs of his state as well as the left’s strong calls to “resist” the Trump administration. As the concluded his comments to reporters Monday, Brown stated there “could be cause for alarm” or for “some optimism” as he said, “[n]othing’s all that predictable in the current administration.”

Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will lead a star-studded group of celebrities in hosting a telethon to benefit the American Civil Liberties Union this month.

The event, dubbed “Stand for Rights: A Benefit for the ACLU,”will be live-streamed on Facebook Live March 31, with celebrities manning the phone banks in New York City.

Other stars expected to participate include Tracey Morgan, Jon Hamm, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Padma Lakshmi, Jane Krakowski, Ellie Kemper and Tituss Burgess.

The non-profit ACLU, headquartered in New York City, has worked hard to oppose President Donald Trump’s policies, including his executive orders temporarily limiting immigration from terror-prone countries.

“Our work in the courts is essential right now to hold off the worst of the abuses,” ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said in a statement. “But it is also the collective will and tireless actions of ‘we the people’ that serve as a bulwark against unconstitutional and wrong-headed policies and executive orders. By supporting our work through this telethon, we can fight even harder to defend the rights guaranteed by our Constitution.”

The event will be produced by Friend of a Friend Productions, the Huffington Post and Funny or Die, the latter of which will reportedly produce short video clips to premiere during the telethon.

Hollywood has become more supportive of the ACLU since Trump’s election.

In January, People vs. O.J. Simpson star Sarah Paulson used her acceptance speech at the SAG Awards to urge celebrities and viewers at home to donate to the organization. In February, talent agency UTA announced it would cancel its annual Oscars party and instead donate $250,000 to the ACLU.

At this year’s Oscars, several celebrities wore ACLU pins on their dresses and tuxedos.

Stand for Rights marks the second celebrity telethon to support the ACLU this year. During Trump’s inauguration, celebrities including Jane Fonda, Judd Apatow and Patricia Arquette hosted a “Love-a-Thon” to support liberal organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood.

[Warning: Adult Language]

TMZ caught up with comedian D.L. Hughley at Los Angles International Airport, to which he said President Donald Trump did not “deserve respect.”

Hughley said, “I think if the president were respect-worthy, you should do it. But I think in all the things he’s done – just this week, accusing a man, a former president, of a felony. He has insulted our allies. He’s lied. A liar doesn’t deserve respect like that. We have two intelligence agencies investigating what he knows is a lie, because you think you can lie on a black man. F–k your respect.”

He continued, “Respect is a two-way street. I give it to you because I got it.”

“The thing about this cat is he talks to rappers, and actors, and comedians pretending to give a shit about the problems in the black community,” Hughley added,” Why doesn’t he just talk to David Copperfield, a magician, so he can make them all go away? But I think you only give respect when you get it. And he’s been disrespectful to just about everybody, except the white supremacists who serve him.”

North Carolina Republican Ted Budd announced Tuesday that he is voting against the American Health Care Act, scheduled for a vote on the House floor Thursday — less than two hours after he joined House Republicans meeting with President Donald Trump.

“As currently written, I cannot support the American Health Care Act,” said the congressman, who lists his occupations as farmer and gun store owner. The AHCA is supported by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-WI) and his leadership team.

Trump made a serious pitch to the members, but House Republicans still see the bill as the speaker’s own.

Budd is a conservative, but not a member of the House Freedom Caucus. The HFC, as the conservative bloc in the House, is leading the fight against the RyanCare bill. Ryan needs 216 votes for his amendment to Obamacare to pass, but the HFC has at least 25 GOP votes of the 237 Republicans in the House–enough to defeat the bill.

Losing Budd is a big hit for the leadership’s whip team. The congressman was pressured heavily even before the president’s visit, as the speaker tries to isolate conservatives from the actual members of the House Freedom Caucus.

In the recent past, conservatives have delivered more than 60 votes against leadership bills, so that GOP leaders have needed to reach out to House Democrats for support, in effect blocking out conservatives, preferring to make deals with Democrats. This time, House Democrats are content to see RyanCare fail.

A Capitol Hill source familiar with Budd’s thinking told Breitbart News that the congressman was waiting for last minute amendments to see if leadership was willing to move closer to a clean repeal of Obamacare. When the “manager’s amendments” were announced last night, the congressman decided that leadership was not serious about repeal, but was really looking to shore up Obamacare for the long haul.

“This bill leaves the structure of Obamacare in place and does not provide the relief that North Carolina families need from high premiums,” the congressman said.

“I am completely committed to repealing Obamacare and do not think that Congress should take a recess until we have done so,” he said.

For the last three political cycles, it has become a rite of passage for House Republicans to vote to repeal the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the legislation that created Obamacare. As a freshman, Budd was not in Congress when all Republicans in the House and Senate voted to pass the full Obamacare repeal in 2015.

Capitol Hill conservatives expected the Republican leadership to reintroduce the 2015 bill, which was written and sponsored by Rep. Tom Price (R.-GA), then the chairman of the House Budget Committee, now the man leading Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services. Instead, Ryan crafted his own RyanCare bill in private working groups with insurance industry representatives, congressional staffers, and selected congressmen.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af2769640:78b64:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton saw FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee as a “typical congressional hearing, where you get a little bit of information, some headline-grabbing, but in terms of the substance, it’s hard to get anything material.”

“That’s why you need these independent pressure points from groups like Judicial Watch under FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act, and get documents – and sue if we don’t get the documents,” he told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.

“The FBI director is chasing, it seems to me, a fantasy based on all the available evidence,” Fitton said. “It’s the Democrat unicorn theory of the election, that somehow it was stolen from Hillary Clinton as a result of an improper conspiracy – of what nature, I’m not clear – between the Trump campaign and the Russians.”

“If there’s any information of substance out there, certainly it hasn’t been made public,” he noted. “What has been made public is specifically that intelligence report that was put out by President Obama’s DNC, I mean intelligence community.”

Fitton said that report was “laughable in many respects.”

“Let me give you an alternative theory of Russian involvement in the election,” he said. “Assuming they hacked Podesta’s emails, assuming they hacked DNC emails, let’s say the material was put out not to help President Trump win – because no one thought he could win. I look at it as the material being put out to hurt the incoming Clinton administration. That’s what I saw it as.”

“Did the Russians know some secret that no one else in America knew, where President Trump was going to win?” he asked. “Of course they didn’t. Like President Trump, they probably thought he had a chance, didn’t know if he was going to win or not, but the bets were all on Hillary Clinton. If you evaluate their actions, assuming their actions that are being talked about could be attributed to them, certainly you can analyze it as they were trying to hurt Hillary Clinton’s incoming presidency.”

“If that’s the case, then it’s a very different analysis in terms of ‘Well, there was a collusion with the Trump people’ because why would the Trump people care about hurting her incoming presidency? They’d want to just win outright,” Fitton argued.

Marlow wondered what the proverbial “statute of limitations” would be for American society moving on from this conspiracy theory, given that eight months of investigation has produced no hard evidence for it.

Fitton noted that “even the top intelligence officials in the Obama administration say there’s no evidence of collusion, so I’m not quite sure where the investigation continues.”

“Are there people who were close to Trump who had communications and worked with the Russians at one point, in terms of entities close to the Russian government or Russian businesses and such?” he asked. “Probably yes. But does one draw from that the conclusion that there was collusion between a presidential campaign and a foreign government to turn the election? I don’t think there’s any evidence of that.”

“It sounds to me like what otherwise might be legitimate areas of inquiry, that can really be handled in a matter of weeks or months, have turned into a magilla, thanks to a politicized FBI and Justice Department. Remember, the attorney general ain’t running things on this issue because he was cornered into recusing himself. As a result, a lot of this is on autopilot from the Obama administration,” he pointed out.

“We ought to be very concerned about this. I don’t think the goal is to affect the 2020 election. I think the goal of these Obama-connected operatives behind these links and behind this pink unicorn theory of the election – as I said, the Sidney Blumenthals of the world – they want to remove President Trump before the end of his term. They want to force him out. I don’t know how you can conclude anything but this,” Fitton contended.

“We shouldn’t take it lightly that the FBI is purporting to still be investigating this conspiracy theory. It’s like being told six months into the election, let’s say in March of 2009, that the FBI was investigating whether President Obama was born in Hawaii or not. It’s that off-base,” he said.

On the subject of President Trump’s accusation that his campaign was “wiretapped” by the Obama administration, Fitton said, “All we know is that supposedly Mr. Trump’s, there is no ‘evidence’ – I don’t know what that means – that his phones were ‘tapped.’”

“That’s a pretty narrow investigative inquiry related to whether there was surveillance of President Trump and his team and his presidential campaign,” Fitton observed. “Again, this is an example of, frankly, the idiot media taking at face value government explanations, when they are always so skeptical for other government explanations.”

“So the FBI is telling us they’ve had a multi-month – presumably since July – investigation of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, to be specific, and there’s been no surveillance. That’s the most remarkable investigation in the history of law enforcement, if that’s the case,” he said.

He noted that FBI Director James Comey “refused to say whether he briefed President Obama on such investigations” during his congressional testimony, but some media outlets have reported the event as though Comey did rule out briefing Obama.

“He also confirmed about the seriousness of the violations of the release of classified information, namely the Flynn transcript, where there was a transcript of a phone call between the general and the Russian ambassador, or so we’re told,” Fitton continued. “He recognized that the leak of any of that type of information would be classified. He didn’t want to talk about it specifically because to acknowledge it would be to acknowledge and confirm classified information, which he isn’t allowed to do.”

“If I were a clear-thinking leftist operative and Democrat, I would be concerned that the only people likely to go to jail as a result of this politicized inquiry would be former officials with the Obama administration likely involved in the leaking of this classified material,” he advised. “If they’re senior, there’s going to be no protection, other than the typical corrupt protection that high-level government officials, former and current, get. But that’s where the seriousness of the crimes are here, and it’s where we’re likely to see jail over.”

Former CIA operations officer Scott Uehlinger, co-host of The Station Chief podcast, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before Congress on Monday.

“When you really cut through it and look through all of the parsed words, and clearly they lawyered up with their statements, that, in fact, we really didn’t learn all that much,” said Uehlinger.

“We have the intelligence people such as Clapper and the head of the CIA saying that at no time did Russia basically influence the election and that there is no real ties between the Trump administration and Russia. But then at the same time, we have an ongoing FBI investigation into him – but even Comey himself said things like, ‘The FBI doesn’t have any information that Obama himself ordered Trump to be wiretapped,’” he observed.

“I don’t think that’s the issue here. I don’t think Obama ever gave such a direct order, and they may not be monitoring Mr. Trump, the president, at all. They’re monitoring his associates for ties to Russia. So the way he says things, it’s like he’s being very careful to walk a very thin line,” he said.

Uehlinger said he spent twelve years living in the former Soviet Union when he worked for the CIA, and he speaks Russian.

“I spent a lot of time literally going head-to-head with Russian intelligence. I mean, they were actually, believe it or not, at my wedding. Russian intelligence was invited to my wedding because I was married over in Moldova. I was friends – I was associates – with all of the intel reps in town, and that included the Russians. So I know things Russian,” he said of his background.

“It’s very interesting how you watch the proceedings yesterday: the Democrats, all of a sudden, have a great interest in Russian operations that they never displayed in the past eight years. Well, I was a station chief. They all seem to be shocked at the idea that Russia attempts to influence the election process,” he said.

“Now, of course Russia attempts to influence the election process. They’ve been doing it for fifty years. They’re not particularly effective at it, but they try to sort of – if they can, they do what they can to influence public opinion, and usually it’s ineffective,” Uehlinger explained.

“However, I would wager they’ve been more effective in this past election simply because with the hacks, the WikiLeaks revelations of the DNC emails and such, basically Russian intelligence was doing the job that a viable true media should be doing themselves. In other words, if we had good journalism in this country, those kinds of revelations would have been made,” he contended.

“In this case, the American people had WikiLeaks to provide the information that normal journalists should provide in a normal kind of society – the society we had, let’s say, thirty years ago. That’s unfortunate. But to feign shock that Russia is attempting to do this by the Democrats is very disingenuous,” he said.

Uehlinger found it “ridiculous” that Democrats and the media have hyped their “Russia hacked the election” narrative for six months and counting, without a shred of evidence.

“We’ve seen some leaks, generally by ‘Deep State’ people in the bureaucracy and whatever, who are unhappy with Trump, and they wish to leak this information out,” he added. “However, we have no leaks that actually are the smoking gun of a relationship, a collusion with Russia, because it doesn’t exist. Common sense dictates we would have seen that already had that come to light. It would have been irresistible to be leaked. The fact that it hasn’t been leaked pretty much tells me it hasn’t happened yet.”

“The thing that I resent as a Russian expert, as somebody who worked against them for many years, I resent the fact that for the past six months Russia’s been used as a political football by the Democrats, as a weapon against the Republicans,” he declared. “And this is not a consequence-free environment. There are political ramifications to this. Dragging Russia’s name through the mud unnecessarily is just not constructive for diplomacy. We’ve got a lot of major problems with the Russians, but there’s no point in needlessly antagonizing them, which is what the Democrats want to do and what they have been doing.”

A caller pointed out the similarities between what Democrats are doing today and McCarthy-era witch hunting.

“That’s very true,” Uehlinger agreed. “One difference between McCarthyism, which Democrats love to pull out, and this is that actually McCarthyism – despite the wrongs that were committed – was actually based on some fact. In fact, the government at the time was riddled with Soviet agents. There was actually some fire there, in that smoke. But in this smoke, there’s no fire.”

“That’s actually a quote from the director of the CIA, Morell, who said exactly that, like a week ago,” he added. “It is ridiculous, and suddenly the Democrats have woken up, and suddenly Russia is a great threat. Where have they been for the past eight years, or for that matter, the last forty years? Traditionally, they’ve been apologists for the Soviet Union and Russia.”

Uehlinger argued that the “Deep State” is “not something out of a James Bond film, where people meet at midnight, and you can’t see their faces, and they’re sitting around a table plotting world domination.”

“The bottom line is, under eight years of an Obama administration, the bureaucracy has been naturally polarized,” he explained. “The people who favored the Obama administration have tended to rise to the top. I would estimate at the CIA, it’s probably, let’s say about 65 percent Democrat and maybe 35 percent Republican or conservative.”

“I was a conservative, but I was always out in the field,” he noted. “The people who are walking around in reality, the people who are in the bazaars and markets of the Third World – much as cops are mostly conservative, the CIA officers in the field tend to be perhaps more conservative, whereas your analysts, the Washington creatures, the people who spend their entire career in Washington tend to be more liberal. But there are a lot more of them than people like myself. We’re outnumbered.”

“Also, many people in the Justice Department have said it’s about 80 percent liberal. The bottom line is, these people, they’re empowered by Hillary Clinton and her former administration calling themselves ‘The Resistance.’ They’re empowered by that, and feel more justified in basically blunting or dulling the policies of the president,” he said.

Marlow noted that Breitbart News has traditionally been “a largely, almost overwhelmingly, anti-Russia news outfit,” but now it is supposedly being examined by the FBI for “Russia ties.” However, he agreed with President Trump that better ties with Russia could be helpful in dealing with mutual enemies like the Islamic State.

“We’re not allowed to have a nuanced adult opinion on Russia,” he lamented. “We must declare them evil, if not the most evil thing on the planet, and Putin the most evil person on the planet, or else we don’t pass some sort of litmus test to the Democratic Party and the establishment media.”

“That’s a very good point,” Uehlinger responded. “It’s true. It’s getting to the point that you can’t have an adult opinion about it. I’m waiting for the day when someone tries to throw something like that at me, who dedicated twelve years of his life to helping U.S. security against the Russian threat.”

“In Europe, there was a case, a female Danish newspaperwoman or something, a journalist, and she was criticizing the Danish government’s immigration policies and all. Immediately, the knee-jerk reaction is she’s an agent of the Russians because now, if you say things like, ‘I want to restrict immigration,’ you’re obviously in the pay of Vladimir Putin. That’s insane, and that really is McCarthyism now, that you’re accusing people of a relationship with Russia that never had it because you simply disagree with their opinion,” he said.

“Unfortunately, this merely empowers the Russians. because what we’re doing, we’re setting ourselves up in a society where Putin is able to show that he is, for instance, the defender of Christianity.” He added, “No one in our society will defend Christianity, and so people feel persecuted. This is definitely happening in Eastern Europe. That makes Putin’s siren call of, ‘Look, Russia is the moral country. Russia is the country that believes in Christianity’ – it makes that propaganda ploy much more effective. So the Democrats are delivering us into the hands of the Russians,” Uehlinger warned.

Arnold Schwarzenegger taunted President Donald Trump over his approval ratings and his 2018 budget proposal in a video he posted to his Twitter account Tuesday.

“Oh, Donald. The ratings are in, and you got swamped,” the actor and former California governor says in the video. “Wow. Now you’re in the thirties?”

“But what do you expect? I mean, when you take away after-school programs for children and Meals on Wheels for the poor people, that’s not what you call ‘making America great again’. Come on!” Schwarzenegger mocked.

Hey, @realDonaldTrump, I have some advice. See you at Hart Middle School? Here&apos;s more info about #afterschool: https://t.co/NOgdhBHyyp pic.twitter.com/NQI2OdVqtF — Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) March 21, 2017

Schwarzenegger appeared to be referring to a recently-released Gallup poll that found Trump at a 37 percent approval rating, his lowest since taking office. However, other polls — including a Rasmussen poll released Tuesday — show the president hovering at around 50 percent approval.

Schwarzenegger and Trump have been feuding for months.

Last month, the Terminator star offered to switch jobs with Trump “so people can finally sleep comfortably again.”

After Celebrity Apprentice struggled with poor ratings throughout the entirety of its rebooted first season, Schwarzenegger quit the once-popular reality show and blamed an anti-Trump boycott for turning audiences and advertisers away.

“When people found out that Trump was still involved as executive producer and was still receiving money from the show, then half the people [started] boycotting it,” he told Empire magazine.

In his 40-second Twitter video on Tuesday, Schwarzenegger invited the president to visit Hart Middle School in Washington D.C. to see the work his After-School All-Stars organization is doing.

“I’ll take you there, so you can see the fantastic work that they’re doing for these children,” the actor said.

Trump has yet to respond to the video.

Disgraced Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King has published a new scare-column in the New York Daily News, calling President Trump’s budget “the most cruel, destructive, and inhumane” budget ever released by a sitting president.

To save you the torture of reading it, I’ve gone through it line by line and picked out the most wild-eyed rhetoric and outrageous claims.

King begins by blaming everything on White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, possibly a bigger boogeyman for the left than the President himself.

“I’m a Leninist. Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal, too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today’s establishment.” These are the words uttered by White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. When someone tells you who they are — believe them.

“If someone tells you who they are, believe them?” I’m sure Shaun King would like us to, given that he’s spent much of his professional career dodging uncomfortable questions about his true ethnicity, and continues to claim his father was black, despite the fact that he has never met him and has never released the results of a DNA test to the public.

Bannon, who was the CEO of Trump’s campaign and is now widely seen as a mix between being his puppet-master and even a co-President

An image created and sustained by the media, with virtually no basis in reality. It’s almost as if the media were so desperate for the return of “co-president” Clinton that they fabricated a stand-in.

It is, unequivocally, the most cruel, destructive, dangerous and inhumane federal budget ever released by an American President.

By a Republican president. You can rest assured that King would be singing a different tune if this were an Obama budget.

At first, I aimed to write about it soon after it was released, but it honestly took me an additional 24 hours to wrap my mind around what we had seen.

Translation: I am lazy and can’t finish my articles on time.

Trump’s budget completely eliminates 19 federal agencies — including funding for PBS, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It cuts funding for Meals on Wheels. Who the hell cuts funding for Meals on Wheels?

Translation: I can’t defend budget cuts to government-funded leftist propaganda, so I’ll focus on an entirely unrelated service to tug on heartstrings and hope people won’t notice (or highlight in bold!) the first three things I mentioned.

It also eliminates funding for 49 National Historic Sites. What are they supposed to do without this funding?

Collect donations, just like Meals on Wheels does? (Donations have actually spiked since the budget announcement) Perhaps a progressive billionaire could help, instead of ploughing millions into socially destabilizing hate-groups like Black Lives Matter.

Trump aims to drastically slash the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by 31%

Oh no! Fewer energy-saving lightbulbs??

The 29% budget cut to the State Department completely eliminates many peacekeeping missions and cultural exchange programs.

Peacekeeping in the Obama era was so effective, it gave rise to ISIS. It clearly deserves those funds!

Even the NYPD is outraged by the budget, which would cut millions upon millions of dollars from the department’s efforts to fight terrorism.

Finally! The first reasonable concern in King’s piece.

The Defense Department increase in Trump’s budget was a staggering $54,000,000,000. I added the zeroes for effect — that’s $54 billion. Our nation already spends more on defense than most of the developed nations of the world combined. This increase is simply absurd and unnecessary.

So, according to Shaun King, cutting funds to fight terrorism is bad, but increasing funds to fight terrorism is … Also bad? It’s almost as if King is a knee-jerk leftist who automatically condemns anything Trump does!

I will concede that $54 billion is a big number. Much bigger than the $240,000 in missing Haiti donation funds that Shaun King managed, and is still unaccounted for.

In short, King believes the Trump budget to be a more questionable document than his own birth certificate. Breitbart readers can of course decide for themselves if the rhetoric matches the reality.

Fox News has indefinitely benched its senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano, after President Donald Trump cited the judge’s claims that President Barack Obama used British intelligence sources to wiretap Trump’s campaign phones, according to sources.

Judge Napolitano has been among the missing during Fox News’s coverage of the confirmation process for Judge Neil Gorsuch, an event for which he should be a primary source of commentary, the L.A. Times notes. Napolitano has been off the air since March 16.

Neither Fox nor Judge Napolitano commented on the situation, but the Times says insiders have confirmed the defacto suspension.

Last week, Napolitano raised eyebrows with claims that Obama employed the British to monitor Trump. The Fox News judicial analyst stated on Fox &amp; Friends on March 14 that “three intelligence sources” say President Obama asked British spy agency GCHQ to obtain transcripts of conversations involving President Trump.

President Trump later pointed to the Fox News analyst’s claims as evidence that Obama tapped his phones, saying people should “ask Fox,” not him, about the claims.

Fox News has not substantiated Napolitano’s claim, and on March 17, Fox host Shepard Smith even denounced the claims that British intelligence agencies tapped Trump’s phones.

The questions have arisen due to charges by Democrats that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election to get Trump elected to the White House, but despite months of investigations by the FBI, as FBI Director James Comey’s testimony revealed, there is no proof that there was any such interference.

House and Senate conservatives continue to oppose the House-led effort to replace Obamacare, but President Donald Trump still publicly supports the effort.

During a Trump campaign rally in Kentucky on Monday night, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed Donald Trump, but he was booed by many skeptics in the crowd when he took the stage. McConnell told the audience that Trump was the answer to Congress’s prayer for a Republican president in Washington D.C.

“You know they returned a Republican congress last year, but they answered our message and our prayer,” McConnell said. “We said ‘Send us somebody who who will sign the repeal of Obamacare into law,’ and they sent us President Donald Trump.”

McConnell praised Trump as the one who would finally help them pass an Obamacare replacement bill.

“You’re going to hear from our great new president, who’s going to give us the chance to fix this health care mess left behind by Barack Obama,” he said.

After Trump took the stage, he defended McConnell, calling him a “tremendous modern day leader” and asked the crowd to clap for their representative.

“I want you to give him a nice hand because he’s on our side,” Trump said. “You’ve got to take care of your people, right?”

Even if the bill passes the House, it faces a tough uphill climb in the Senate, as well as some major changes. Senate sources have indicated that McConnell will be forced to rewrite much of the bill to get enough senators to support it.

Trump appears confident that he can get something passed through Congress, noting his impatience to move on tax reform and trade deals.

During the rally, Trump appeared to ask McConnell to join him on the stage during the rally, but the Senate Majority leader remained where he was.

“How are you doing, Mitch?” Trump asked. “Are we going to be okay? Everything good? That health care is looking good? Good. Thanks, Mitch.”

Sen. Rand Paul was noticeably absent at the rally, as he remains staunchly opposed to the House-led bill.

“I happen to like, a lot, Senator Rand Paul. I do,” Trump said, promising to work with Paul in the Senate to get the healthcare bill “passed in some form.”

Trump vocally supported McConnell and Ryan’s efforts, promising to get the job done.

“We are going to be working very closely with our leader, Mitch McConnell, to get that job done. Paul Ryan, everybody,” he said. “They are going to be working very hard.”

Trump is investing a lot of his political capital in getting the bill passed, personally traveling to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to lobby for it.

The bill is scheduled for a House vote on Thursday, but conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus remain skeptical that it will pass.

“At this time, the bill does not have the votes to pass,” Freedom Caucus Communications director Alyssa Farah told Breitbart News on Monday.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af1d15ab6:696054:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">. @IngrahamAngle : Trump needs to focus on his promises to the country.

Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox &amp; Friends,” conservative radio host Laura Ingraham advised President Donald Trump to remain on track when it comes delivering his promises to the country and to not allow the investigation into his ties with Russia to get him off track.

“I do think it’s probably pretty wise at this point for President Trump to not to tweet issues or points that are tangential or that are not factually confirmed,” Ingraham said. “I think three weeks ago when he — or two weeks ago when he tweeted that comment out about Obama wiretapping, that was a mistake, and I think he should stay focused on the things he promised the country that he would do.”

“This investigation is going to run its course,” she added. “But they are going to try to use this to get him off track every chance they can. They want to use it to try to get him off track and try to hurt his credibility. That’s their goal. They want him out.”

On Monday, former Denver Broncos great John Elway delivered his “highest recommendation” for Donald Trump nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch to be confirmed for the United States Supreme Court.

Elway supplied his endorsement via a letter sent to the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the group currently considering Trump’s nomination, the Washington Examiner reported.

“It is with my highest recommendation that I support Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the United States Supreme Court,” the famed NFL quarterback said in his letter.

“A native of Colorado, Neil has demonstrated tremendous intelligence, character, and fairness while serving for more than a decade on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit,” Elway continued. “His credentials, integrity and sound moral compass are major reasons why he’s already received so much bipartisan support for his nomination.”

Elway concluded his endorsement letter saying, “Neil is a big Denver Broncos fan, and I can tell you that I’m a big fan of his. I look forward to having Neil Gorsuch, one of our own from the great state of Colorado, as the next Supreme Court justice.”

Elway’s endorsement comes on the first day of confirmation hearings for Gorsuch, a Federal Appeals Court Judge, who was put forward by President Donald Trump to join the court after Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly passed away last year.

Gorsuch has received unequivocal endorsements from a long list of officials and others as the committee weighs his candidacy. Republican Texas Senator Ted Cruz even noted that Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously as a candidate for the Court of Appeals.

Indeed, Gorsuch received the support of such partisan Democrats as Sens. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Ted Kennedy, and John Kerry.

Monday on Fox News Channel’s “The O’Reilly Factor,” host Bill O’Reilly reacted to the House Intelligence Committee hearing early in the day regarding President Donald Trump and his possible ties to Russia that featured testimony from FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers.

O’Reilly went through the numerous allegations leveled at Trump and his 2016 presidential campaign but downplayed the possibility that anything might come out of those charges. He went on to say that leaks within various federal government agencies must be dealt with.

Transcript as follows (courtesy of BillOReilly.com):

The House Intelligence Committee spent a few hours talking with FBI Chief James Comey and NSA boss Admiral Mike Rogers.

It was clear from the beginning that there was a political agenda, as there always is.

Republican Congress people wanted to know about the leakers – people within government giving classified information to reporters.

That was their top concern.

On the Democratic side, it was the Obama tap – the allegation that President Trump Tweeted out.

At this point, after today’s testimony, there is absolutely no evidence President Obama tapped the Trump Tower.

But today, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said there will be more tap information forthcoming, especially about General Flynn.

The fair thing here is to be fair, avoid speculation, but skepticism on the issue is warranted.

In addition to the tap business, Democrats zeroed in on two former members of the Trump Campaign, hoping to link them to the Russians.

First was a man named Roger Stone, who worked for Mr. Trump for two months in 2015.

He was a consultant.

The second was Paul Manafort, who worked for the Trump campaign for approximately five months but did have a powerful position as campaign chairman.

Democrats insinuated that both men were involved in some kind of corrupt scheme, but the admiral and Mr. Comey would not take the bait, saying that the investigation is ongoing and they cannot comment.

Both men deny any wrongdoing.

Talking Points will be surprised if anything comes of this Russian deal.

However, that controversy is what drove President Trump to accuse President Obama.

Mr. Trump is so infuriated that the media has obsessed on the alleged Russia connection that he lashed out, trying to create a firestorm over the Obama administration’s surveillance history.

Problem is, there is no evidence that anything happened at the Trump Tower.

There is evidence that the Obama Administration surveilled journalists and even the German Chancellor. But that does not go to President Trump’s point.

The accusation that President Obama was actively involved in harming the Trump Campaign has now harmed the president himself.

He needs the American people to focus on the economy, the new healthcare proposal and border security … not alleged conspiracies.

In the future, the president would be wise to embrace only facts in his pronouncements.

The issue of leaks is of vital importance, and both Comey and Rogers acknowledged that today.

It was instructive to see that no Democrat on the House committee really zeroed in on the leakers.

Talking Points expects, expects the FBI to find not only who leaked stuff about General Flynn and the Russian ambassador, but also who violated the White House protocol by putting out the president’s conversations with the prime minister of Australia and the president of Mexico.

If the FBI cannot do that – cannot arrest the leakers – this country is in major trouble.

Summing up, Republicans want to get away from the tap thing. Democrats continue to peddle the Russia/Trump campaign situation.

And that’s the memo.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15af11024db:51ecee:ebe4c8e6</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A spokeswoman for the House Freedom Caucus told Breitbart News the technical and Medicare-related changes to the RyanCare bill up for a House floor vote Thursday will not save the bill from defeat.

“The amendments offered by Republican leadership do little to address the serious concerns of House conservatives,” said Alyssa Farah, the caucus communications director.

“At this time, the bill does not have the votes to pass,” she said. “The Freedom Caucus will continue to work with House colleagues, the Senate, and the White House to find a path forward that works for the American people.”

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R.-WI) posted changes to his American Health Care Act bill late Monday night that were made to the RyanCare bill by the House Rules Committee, hours before President Donald Trump visits the Capitol to save the speaker’s plan to save the Obamacare program created by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Trump’s visit is significant, because taken at face value, it demonstrates the president’s commitment to Ryan’s plan, but it could also be read as Trump’s attempt to inoculate himself from the charge that he did not do enough to help the speaker if RyanCare is defeated.

The changes are both technical and substantive amendments. The speaker said the technical amendments were necessary to ensure that the bill survives the “Byrd Bath,” the process by which senators allow parliamentarians to strip away parts of a House budget bill that violate the Byrd Rule. The Byrd Rule states that the only bills that are allowed to use the Senate’s privileged budget reconciliation track and remain exempt from filibusters are bills that deal purely with revenues and spending.

.@freedomcaucus has suggested multiple alternatives to unite Rs &amp; earn support among Ds, but GOP leaders have so far rejected major changes. https://t.co/x9uPKjrMRi — Justin Amash (@justinamash) March 20, 2017

The significant amendments to the bill include closing the provision in the RyanCare bill that allowed an abortion tax credit, cutting back the expansion of Health Savings Accounts, and adding new restrictions on Medicaid.

Under the new amendments, rules would discourage New York State from forcing non-New York City counties to subsidize the Big Apple’s Medicaid bill. The amendment would require able-bodied adults without dependents to have a job before they apply for Medicaid benefits. The Empire State provisions apply only to that state.

“I want to thank the White House and members from all parts of our conference who have helped make this the strongest legislation it can be,” Ryan said. “With this amendment, we accelerate tax relief, give states additional options to spend health care dollars how they choose, strengthen what were already substantial pro-life protections, and ensure there are necessary resources to help older Americans and the disabled.”

“The American Health Care Act is the result of a long, member-driven process, and these improvements are an extension of that inclusive approach,” said the speaker, whose bill was crafted privately by working groups made up of insurance industry representatives, congressional staffers, and selected members of Congress.

Capitol Hill conservatives are incensed and frustrated by Ryan’s handling of what was supposed to be a repeal-and-replace of Obamacare but was hijacked by the speaker. House Republicans were told behind closed doors that the RyanCare was precisely worded to unwind features of the Obamacare program that destabilized insurance markets. As the bill progressed through the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget Committees, Republicans did not offer amendments, and amendments by Democrats were ruled out of order, followed by appeals of those rulings, which the Republicans voted to table.

The text of the RyanCare bill was first released March 6 at 6:00 p.m., as congressmen and senators were still arriving back into Washington after a weekend recess.

Until Monday’s night’s changes, the text of the RyanCare bill was exactly as it was the night it was first made public.

BREAKING NEWS → We just introduced our bill to #RepealAndReplace Obamacare. https://t.co/Ut0DDR4wzG pic.twitter.com/1qTCXvkZzE — Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) March 6, 2017

An important part of how the speaker is managing his bill is his need to preserve the trappings of “regular order.” Regular order is the routine process, by which measures are developed in committees and subcommittee with hearings and an open amendment process. While the RyanCare bill continued step-by-step through the committees, the speaker was able to tout his returning to regular order — one of his pledges — when he first ran for speaker to block a conservative from succeeding Speaker John Boehner (R.-OH).

While Republicans are content to go-along-to-get-along within their respective committees, the RyanCare bill is heading for defeat on the House floor. There are 237 Republicans and 193 Democrats. The five vacant seats mean that Ryan needs 216 votes, a target beyond his grasp if 21 members of the House Freedom Caucus hold the line. Reporting by Breitbart News puts the HFC bloc against RyanCare north of 25.

Under the House rules, that is regular order; the bill is now awaiting consideration by the Rules Committee, chaired by Rep. Pete Sessions (R.-TX). Sessions was himself a contender to replace Boehner, but he chose instead to back Ryan. Although Sessions is the chairman of the committee, the committee is in practice the speaker’s instrument to control legislation. Called the “Speaker’s Commitee,” the Rules Committee has extraordinary power to change legislation and set the terms of debate and the degree to which a bill would be subject to amendments on the floor.

Conservatives are still waiting to see if the House Republican leadership instructs the Rules Committee to allow an open amendment process on the floor.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aef7285f9:237f47:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

While speaking at a rally in Kentucky on Monday night, Donald Trump referenced former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick and his struggles in trying to find a new team.

According to TMZ, Trump said:

“And you know, your San Francisco quarterback,” Trump said, via TMZ. “I’m sure nobody ever heard of him. I’m just reporting the news. There was an article today — I love to report the news and then they said I made a mistake, right? I said, ‘No, the people reporting the news made a mistake if it’s wrong.’ But there was an article today, it was reported that NFL owners don’t want to pick him up because they don’t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump. Do you believe that? I just saw that. I just saw that. I said if I remember that one I’m gonna report it to the people of the Kentucky. Because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag.

Trump references a story from Bleacher Report last week in which Mike Freeman cited an unnamed NFL source, claiming Kaepernick’s inability to sign with a team directly resulted from fears that it would lead to more protests, in addition to the fear that President Trump would tweet about their team.

For what it’s worth, Kaepernick has said that he will not continue his anthem protests at NFL games. However, if Freeman’s story is accurate, the damage has already been done.

On the first day of confirmation hearings for Federal Appeals Court Judge Neil Gorsuch to be named as a Supreme Court Justice, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) criticized what he referred to as the “Roberts court” and said Gorsuch taking a seat on the bench would further “infect” it.

“What this moment in our history and our nation’s history calls for is a nominee whose experience demonstrates an ability to set aside rigid views in favor of identifying common ground and crafting strong consensus opinions,” Franken said, adding that President Barack Obama’s nominee of liberal Judge Merrick Garland fit that description.

“But your record suggests that, if confirmed, you will espouse an ideology that I believe has already infected the bench — an ideology that backs big business over individual Americans and refuses to see our country as the dynamic and diverse nation that my constituents wake up in every morning.”

Franken, who referred several time to the Supreme Court as the “Roberts court,” acknowledged Gorsuch’s experience and said he has “strong opinions,” but questioned his interpretation of the Constitution. Franken said:

You’re a man of considerable qualifications and experience and having reviewed your decisions I can say that you’re a man of strong opinions. But the task before this committee is not to determine whether you are a man of convictions, rather it’s incumbent upon us to determine whether the views you espouse and whether your interpretation of the Constitution take proper measure of the challenges the American people face every day.

Franken then interpreted the nation’s “founding document” as ensuring “justice and equality” for people based on their immigration status and sexual orientation or gender identity.

“[The committee] must determine whether your understanding of the founding document is one that will make real its promise of justice and equality to all Americans, black and white, immigrants, Native Americans, gay, straight, and transgender.”

During the 2016 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump named Gorsuch as one of 21 people he was considering to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia if he were elected.

Trump drew strong praise from those who supported him for president when he selected Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee, including Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed, who said:

President Trump won 81 percent of the evangelical vote in no small measure because he made an ironclad pledge that if elected he would fill the vacancy on the US Supreme Court with a strict constructionist who would respect the Constitution and the rule of law, not legislate from the bench.

Michael A. Needham, CEO of Heritage Action for America, said, “Judge Neil Gorsuch is a nominee ‘very much in the mold’ of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Trump deserves credit for fulfilling his campaign pledge by nominating an individual who will, based on his record, interpret the text of the Constitution rather than create unwritten rights supposedly hidden between the lines.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aef1ff137:2015ba:ebe4c8e6</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Monday on her nationally syndicated radio show, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan warned that President Donald Trump should not abandon his populist economic message that was a big part of his 2016 campaign. If he did so for the “globalists” or what he deemed the “old Goldman Sachs route,” Buchanan said it would be “fatal” for his presidency.

Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of LauraIngraham.com)

BUCHANAN: In the Trump Administration, you have the Goldman Sachs folks versus the Bannon/Miller opposition. Reince Priebus is moving towards the Bannon camp – he is working together with the populists; you need both agendas to win the day.

INGRAHAM: We have Bush loyalists in the Administration. How will this reflect the decision making moving forward?

BUCHANAN: If the agenda is going to be implemented, it will rely more heavily on Donald Trump who understands what got him here and what he believes himself. This is the way to restore the balance, and the president knows this – we have to rely on him to do it. If Trump decides to go the old Goldman Sachs route, the Globalists, the game is over and effort in vain. I am betting on Trump himself to get the agenda passed.

INGRAHAM: That’s the end of Trump. That’s the end of American nationalism, populism, all of it.

BUCHANAN: The Goldman Sachs people are interested in the globe; these are the Davos people. These are the folks that cost the Republican Party and cost the country and destroyed manufacturing. Trump has people in there that are economic nationalists, and that battle is underway, but if Trump abandons that nationalism, that would be fatal for the Trump presidency. These issues are going to come back again and again, because they came up from the people. I don’t think the American people and the folks who voted for him are going to go away.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aeecd4e5d:194238:ebe4c8e6</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Talk show host Chelsea Handler tweeted a joke mocking President Donald Trump’s unborn grandchild Monday afternoon, but appeared to misspell the word “genes,” leading Trump’s sons to reply with the correct spelling.

“I guess one of @realDonaldTrump’s sons is expecting a new baby,” Handler tweeted. “Just what we need. Another person with those jeans. Let’s hope for a girl.”

I guess one of @realDonaldTrump&apos;s sons is expecting a new baby. Just what we need. Another person with those jeans. Let&apos;s hope for a girl. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 20, 2017

Handler had apparently attempted to use the word “genes.”

Donald Trump Jr. replied to Handler’s post to correct the mistake, writing: “Jeans??? I guess I’m not at all surprised… but really?!?! #genes”

Jeans??? I guess I&apos;m not at all surprised… but really?!?! #genes https://t.co/fIUJwEtl8U — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 20, 2017

A short time later, Eric Trump — who announced earlier Monday that he and wife Lara are expecting a boy in September — also replied to correct the tweet and remind Handler he is expecting a son.

Somewhat ironically, Handler mocked Melania Trump’s English skills in a recent interview at Sundance, during which she said she would never interview the First Lady on her Netflix talk show.

“No. Melania? To talk about what? She can barely speak English,” she told Variety in January.

The First Lady, who was born in Slovenia, reportedly speaks five languages.

Handler apologized for the spelling error in a follow-up tweet Monday evening, saying she was a “little stoned.”

Sorry about spelling mistake. I meant &quot;genes,&quot; not &quot;jeans.&quot; I&apos;m a little stoned. What&apos;s your excuse? — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 20, 2017

The 42-year-old Chelsea star — who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race — has been a vocal critic of Trump since well before the November election.

In April, the comedian posed semi-nude with the phrase, “Trump is a butt hole” scrawled across her back.

“It’s always a good thing to be able to look at somebody and be like, ‘That’s the worst thing that could happen,’” she told Variety in September. “And I think we should keep him in the spotlight. Not as president, obviously, but, you know, as The Apprentice or whatever that show is called.”

In January, Handler led the Women’s March on Main in Park City, Utah, a sister march of the larger anti-Trump Women’s March on Washington that occurred simultaneously in the nation’s capital.

“Women are under a right-wing political assault, and I intend to fight back with all my might against a Republican president, a Republican Congress, and the radical, religious right who are drooling to defund Planned Parenthood health services nationwide,” she wrote in a guest column for the Hollywood Reporter at the time.

President Donald Trump signaled his eagerness to make dramatic trade deals during a rally in Kentucky on Monday.

“We’re going to be doing some trade deals as soon as we get the health care finished. Oh, I’m looking forward to these trade deals,” Trump said. “There is going to be no ambiguity.”

The president specified that he would pursue “reciprocal” trade deals with foreign countries, charging them similar import taxes as they charged the United States.

Trump described NAFTA as “the worst trade deal ever made by any country I think in the world,” pointing out that since then, America lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs.

“Don’t worry, we are starting on NAFTA very soon,” he promised.

He hinted that more car companies would build more factories in Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky.

“It is not going to happen, not going to happen anymore, Kentucky, remember that, okay?” Trump said with a grin. “You just worry about your basketball team. I will take care of the rest.”

The president repeatedly cited the political legacy of former Kentucky legislator Henry Clay, particularly on trade.

“Clay said that trade must be fair, equal, and reciprocal,” Trump said. “Boom.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aee7a7c79:11ebb6:ebe4c8e6</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The leader of the Republican Study Committee chose to remain outside the conservative coalition fighting Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-WI) and his American Health Care Act, which amends the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act so as to stabilize insurance company margins.

“We’re a yes and we’re excited to be there,” said Rep. Mark Walker (R.-NC), the chairman of the RSC. Founded in the 1970s, the RSC was the conservative bloc in the House of Representatives, until the 2013-2014 session of Congress, when Speaker John Boehner (R.-OH) pressured members to support moderate Rep. Steve Scalise (R.-LA). Under Scalise, the RSC was incorporated into the House GOP leadership’s own whip system.

Walker spoke at the White House Thursday after meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House flanked by Rep. Mia Love (R-UT), Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R.-TN), and other Republican congressmen, including Scalise, who is now the GOP’s Majority Whip.

“We appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the president the best ways forward to repeal and replace Obamacare,” Walker said.

“For over six weeks, we’ve been working with the White House, House leadership, congressional committees and members of the Republican Study Committee to address conservative concerns and make the bill better for the American people,” he said.

“Based on our conversations with the president, several measures to improve the bill will be added in the final product,” he said.

Walker said the president agreed that the RyanCare bill would be amended before it reached his desk to create a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients without dependents and remove provisions in the Ryan bill that would have allowed tax credits for abortions.

“On balance and with the changes we agreed to in the bill’s final text, I can vote for it,” he said. “We will continue working to advocate changes to the bill, and hope the legislation improves in the Senate. At the end of the day,” Walker said, “we are all committed to repealing Obamacare.”

The RSC has a membership of more than 170 members, which would make it the most powerful militia on Capitol Hill, but its own membership is now so diverse across ideological lines that it rarely votes as a bloc.

Before Scalise took over the RSC, Rep. Jim Jordan (R.-OH) tried to lead the committee as the conservative bloc in the House, but when he ran afoul of Boehner, he was turned out in favor of Scalise. This was the immediate reason why Jordan founded the House Freedom Caucus.

As of this publication, the House Freedom Caucus, along with random libertarian congressmen and House Republicans from liberal districts, have the votes to block the RyanCare bill when it comes up for a vote scheduled for Thursday. The HFC does not release its whip count, but a Capitol Hill source familiar with the whip count told Breitbart News that the HFC still has the votes to defeat the bill, if the Democrats also vote against the bill.

There are 237 Republicans and 193 Democrats in the House. With five vacancies, Speaker Ryan needs 216 votes to pass his Obamacare amendment, but if 21 HFC Republicans hold the line, the bill fails.

If the bill fails, which is still a very strong possibility, members of the House Republican Conference are going to have to not only figure out what to do next about their promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, they are also going to have to decide if Ryan is still the man to be holding the gavel.

The same votes needed to defeat RyanCare are enough to pass a motion to vacate the chair and force out Ryan the same way conservatives forced out Boehner.

Mark Walker (R.-NC) make remarks about his support of RyanCare in a video posted by House GOP Whip’s office:</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aee5ee54b:eba8f:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The leader of the Tea Party Patriots told Breitbart News she and her activists are backing Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court on Capitol Hill Monday, despite the lack of opposition from left-wing operatives.

“We are here on Capitol Hill today and we will be here tomorrow when Judge Gorsuch testifies for 10 hours. in addition, our Tea Party Patriots are making phone calls and sending emails and letters to their senators from across the country,” said Jenny Beth Martin, the author of the 2012 book Tea Party Patriots: The Second American Revolution.

Martin was joined by two dozen volunteers holding signs outside the Hart Senate Office Building, while Gorsuch spent the day listening to senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee make opening remarks before making his own 10-minute statement.

Gorsuch was nominated by President Donald Trump to fill the seat on the high court made vacant with the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia.

When the nominee walked into the hearing, he was mobbed by senators, well-wishers, and at least 30 photographers. The shutter clicks from the still cameras rose and fell like the waves of sleet upon a tin roof. His every step and motion triggered a new wave of shutter clutters, so much so that reporters, who are not members of the photographers gallery, stood up to take photos and videos of the photographers. It was not just the swarm of photographers in front of Gorsuch at the witness table, but also the photographers and video cameras in the shooters’ nests revealed by the removed panels in the walls on either side of the Hart-216 hearing room.

Also inside the room were 10-to-12 Capitol Hill police officers, including an officer with a still camera and a video camera, ready to document violations of the law or Senate decorum or both. Outside the room, there were four checkpoints: the immediate doorway, the doorway to the small lobby outside the hearing the room, then the door to the larger lobby on the other side of that door, and finally the hallway leading to that larger lobby.

Back outside Hart, Martin and the Tea Party Patriots were joined by activists from Concerned Women for America, Young Women for America, and the Susan B. Anthony List.

Martin said she was surprised that the left-wing protesters had not shown up to rally against Gorsuch, but an important lesson learned for Tea Party activists has been that regardless of what the Democrats do, the Tea Party must show up.

“It is important to show up,” she said. “No matter how big the event is, you show up. You talk to people, you hold signs, you let people know we are here–that is how you convert hearts and minds.”

The Republicans hold a 52-to-48 majority in the Senate. The Senate rules require 60 votes to end debate and hold a vote. Without saying it out loud, Senate Republican leaders have signaled that if Senate Democrats insist on extending debate, in the attempt to delay and/or block a vote on the nominee, they will challenge and overturn the 60-vote rule for ending debate for Supreme Court nominees.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aee43643e:c4fe9:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Every few years, the botanical garden down on the National Mall proudly boasts its prized “corpse flower.” In years when our federal swamp gets hot and icky enough, the foul-smelling plant turns a throbbing purple and blooms.

Like the swollen tongue of a bloated battlefield corpse — pressing at the cuffs, seams and Sam Brownes — the engorged spadix of the titan arum grows until bursting into a stench that is described as a cross between rotting meat and heat-ripened garbage. The odor is so repellent that it tricks flies into thinking the plant is a decaying corpse, thus its name.

This being Washington and the seat of your federal government, such a carnival of putrefaction inexplicably attracts people from all around by the thousands to take part in the jolly rotten occasion.

Yes, in most of America, good people see a skunk and quickly scurry the other way. Here in Washington, it’s called a homecoming. They see a skunk, and they see mama.

So it is with that other periodic event just up the hill. Every few years, Congress convenes to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court and, watch out, here come the flies.

This year’s picnic feast will be Neil Gorsuch, a highly respected appeals court judge nominated by President Trump to replace the late legal titan Justice Antonin Scalia.

For decades, these confirmations were fairly basic, straightforward affairs.

Is the nominee qualified? Criminal background check to make sure he could not be bribed on the bench. Does he understand the Constitution? Will she faithfully and honestly adhere to the Constitution and always apply it with justice and equality?

Well, that all changed back in the 1960s when the absurdly named “liberals” and “progressives” finally realized that the electorate would never buy their crazy authoritarian bunkum. So they decided that the electorate needed to be cut out of the deal. That was when they started stacking the courts with people who flat out reject the notion that the Constitution actually means anything. These power-hungry neanderthals certainly have no intentions whatsoever of upholding the Constitution or applying it fairly.

This is how you wind up with four justices on the high court who embrace the notion that the Constitution means whatever they say it means, including Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who announced her own constitutional credentials as a “wise Latina.” Seriously.

And it is how you wind up with a crazy lunatic on the Left Coast’s “9th Circus” who somehow decides that the rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution extend to foreigners in foreign lands. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if these sleazeballs cared this much about the rights of actual American citizens?

Already, Democrats in the Senate have declared that they have no interest in taking Judge Gorsuch or his confirmation hearings seriously.

“The high burden of proof that Judge Gorsuch has to meet is largely a result of the president who nominated him,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who was elected to the Senate from the ridiculous state of Connecticut despite repeatedly lying about fighting in the Vietnam War.

In other words, according to Mr. Blumenthal, it’s all about politics. Nothing to do with the Constitution. He doesn’t like the president, so he will never vote for Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation.

Break out the smelling salts. It’s gonna be a long, putrid week along the Potomac River.

TEL AVIV – A senior delegation arrived in Washington Sunday to meet with officials from the Trump administration to discuss settlement activity and reportedly receive approval for construction in eastern sections of Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief of staff Yoav Horowitz and Israel’s Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer are scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt in order to reach an agreement regarding the settlements.

The meeting comes just days after Greenblatt completed a visit to the region in which he met twice with Netanyahu, as well as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah and King Abdullah II in Amman.

Netanyahu and Greenblatt made “progress on the issue of Israeli settlement construction following up on President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu’s agreement in Washington last month to work out an approach that reflects both leaders’ views,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office issued after Thursday’s meeting said.

Diplomatic officials said Netanyahu was seeking a green light from the White House to build in eastern Jerusalem and the larger settlement blocs in exchange for halting construction in the smaller settlements beyond the security fence, the daily Israel Hayom reported.

Netanyahu is also vying to receive Washington’s approval for the construction of a new settlement to replace Amona, which was evacuated last month. If it goes ahead, it would be the first settlement to be built in nearly three decades.

Netanyahu on Saturday night left for a three day trip to China and, according to the Times of Israel, the fact that he was not accompanied by Horowitz underscores the importance of settlement negotiations with the U.S.

In a joint press briefing last month, Trump told Netanyahu to “hold back” on settlements.

However, in a departure from traditional U.S. diplomacy in the region, Greenblatt met with settler leaders last week, including Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan and Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy for the Council of Jewish Communities of Judea and Samaria in the West Bank.

Following the meeting, Dagan said, “We respect Trump and the new government. We’re pleased there is a supportive government [in Washington].”

“Our requests are to our government and to our ministers. We must make a drastic change and stop this edicts [against settlement activity] that harm the basic rights” of the Jewish communities in the West Bank, Dagan said.

Some of Judaism’s holiest sites are located in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount and Western Wall in Jerusalem; the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron; and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aee27c97e:9b56c:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Secretary of Defense James Mattis on Thursday following what the Saudi government proclaimed to be a successful meeting with President Donald Trump. The two reportedly discussed tensions in the Middle East with a focus on “confronting Iran’s destabilizing regional activities.”

According to Gulf news network al-Arabiya, Salman and Mattis held a closed-door discussion for “over three hours” and created an “atmosphere of consensus” regarding the Islamist threats facing both countries in the region. The Pentagon statement confirmed that containing the influence of Iran – whose terror proxies are playing major roles in conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen – took up much of their conversation.

The prince, who also serves as Saudi Arabia’s defense minister, told reporters, “Saudi Arabia is ready to send its troops to Syria as the country would do all it takes to eradicate terrorism,” according to al-Arabiya. The network adds that Mattis and Salman were joined by “Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, the National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, the President’s senior counselor for economic initiatives Dina Powel, the White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, and senior defense and foreign ministry officials.”

The conversation followed a meeting with President Trump Wednesday, after which a spokesman for the prince issued a glowing statement of the U.S. president. “Prince Mohammed considers his Excellency [Trump] as a true friend of Muslims who will serve the Muslim World in an unimaginable manner,” the statement read in part, “opposite to the negative portrait of his Excellency [Trump] that some have tried to promote.” The prince also appeared to support President Trump’s plans to build a wall on the American southern border: “Both sides discussed the Saudi successful experience in building a fence on the Saudi-Iraqi border, which led to preventing illegal entrance of individuals, as well as preventing smuggling operations.”

The prince also appeared to support President Trump’s plans to build a wall on the American southern border: “Both sides discussed the Saudi successful experience in building a fence on the Saudi-Iraqi border, which led to preventing illegal entrance of individuals, as well as preventing smuggling operations.”

CNN adds that the meeting also reportedly yielded “billions of dollars in investments in the U.S.,” though the report did not specify which industries would be receiving the largess.

Mohammed bin Salman’s meeting with President Trump occurred as King Salman attended scheduled meetings with senior Communist Party officials in China, seeking further investment into the Saudi economy.

The emphasis on containing Iran highlights Saudi tensions with the largest Shiite Muslim country in the world, which it regularly accuses of playing a key role in exporting terrorism worldwide. Saudi Arabia itself has a checked history of exporting Wahhabism, an extremist strain of jihadist Islam, and Saudi government officials have been implicated in some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the world.

Saudi Arabia is currently seeking to overturn a law that allows the victims of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks to sue the kingdom for damages, citing al-Qaeda’s communications with Saudi government officials.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry has taken the opportunity of the meeting between Mattis and the prince to condemn Saudi Arabia once again, calling his visit to Washington “deluded and fallacious” and accusing Saudi Arabia of war crimes. Mohammed bin Salman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, was “one of the main directors of the Saudi war on the innocent and defenseless Yemeni nation, and the manifestation of terror and horror in Syria, Bahrain and other regional and world countries.”

“The history of the Middle East will teach all, especially petrodollar-dependent states who have through the fantasy and illusion [of being able] to buy security moved to offer a green light to the intervention of foreign players, that they are making a huge mistake because previous interventions by trans-regional powers have only led to insecurity in countries and the states that have summoned the foreign powers,” Qassemi warned.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aee27c97e:9b56a:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Monday on CNN, in offering her analysis of the House Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, network political analyst Gloria Borger said President Donald Trump suffered “the worst and most perilous day” of his “young” presidency.

Borger said, “You know, I think if you take a step back for a minute, Wolf, you would have to say this is the worst and most perilous day of Donald Trump’s young presidency. In this hearing over the last bunch of hours, we have seen the director of the FBI rebut Donald Trump directly. He said, first of all, there was no wiretapping by the former president of Trump Tower. He confirmed an investigation into the question of whether there was cooperation as he put it between Trump associates and the Russians.”

“He said the fact that the UK corroborated in some kind of a wiretap was wrong,” he continued. “And that he also said there was no evidence of election machine hacking. And so on all four of those points, you know, you would have to say, while Sean Spicer said that nothing has changed, I think was his quote, I think a lot has changed after this hearing today because as Devin Nunes put it, and I think he’s right, a cloud is hanging over the Trump administration right now. And they are going to have a hard time figuring out how to handle it.”

On the first day of confirmation hearings for Federal Appeals Court Judge Neil Gorsuch to be named as a Supreme Court Justice, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) reminded the Democrats, who one after another criticized the nominee, that during his confirmation hearing a decade ago for the federal seat he holds now, not one Democrat — including Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama — voted against Gorsuch.

“A decade ago, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed by this committee for the Federal Court of Appeals by a voice vote,” Cruz said. “He was likewise confirmed by the entire United States Senate by a voice vote without a single Democrat speaking a word of opposition.

“Not a word of opposition from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,” Cruz said. “Not from Harry Reid, or Ted Kennedy, or John Kerry.”

“Not from Senators Feinstein, Leahey, or Durbin, who still sit on this committee,” Cruz said. “Not even from Senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, or Joe Biden.”

“Not a one of them spoke a word against Judge Gorsuch’s nomination a decade ago,” Cruz said.

Cruz said that not only did President Donald Trump play an unprecedented role in the selection of a justice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia by telling the American people of the 21 people — including Gorsuch — who would be under consideration if he were elected president, but the voters weighed in.

Thus, Gorsuch was “no ordinary nominee,” Cruz said.

“His nomination carries with it a super legitimacy that is also unprecedented in our nation’s history,” Cruz said. “The American people played a very direct role in helping choose this nominee.”

Cruz also noted that since Democrats voted for Gorsuch’s federal judgeship 10 years ago, his outstanding record since then should make confirming him even easier.

Notwithstanding its leftist political leanings, the American Bar Association (ABA) earlier this month gave Gorsuch a “well qualified” rating to serve as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.

The ABA has three ratings for judicial nominees: not qualified, qualified, and well qualified. The ABA’s standing committee on the federal judiciary was unanimous in granting Gorsuch its highest rating.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aedb94fd0:6172fc:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Monday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh maintained a House Intelligence Committee hearing that featured testimony from FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Michael Rogers was meant to send a message to President Donald Trump and his administration.

Limbaugh argued that although there were some good questions from Republicans members during the hearing, it was meant to be a warning shot at Trump — allow Washington Republicans to run the town or face possible impeachment.

Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh.com):

These hearings today, what happened last week and the week before that, what happened during the transition period… What all of this is can be explained simply by saying, “Look at how terrified they are in the Washington-New York establishment, of Donald Trump and draining the swamp.” The Never Trumpers on both sides of the aisle. There are conservative Never Trumpers today celebrating over the fact that Comey made it official that there’s an investigation of Trump and colluding with the Russians.

These people know that there isn’t any evidence of this, but that doesn’t matter. What everybody in Washington supports is the smearing, the slander, and the libel of Donald Trump. And these hearings today? The FBI director, James Comey, is trying to save the jobs of a lot of people. He’s trying to save the careers of a whole lot of people — his included — in, I think, an inappropriate way. And the Republicans in this committee? Look folks, I’ve been waiting. I’ve been patiently waiting. I’ve been trying to hold it, keep the powder dry. But the Republicans on this committee…

I know it’s early, and they’re gonna go on all day. But so far, outside of Trey Gowdy and a question from Peter King and Devin Nunes the chairman, there just hasn’t been much. For example, “Are you still investigating the Clinton Foundation, Director Comey?” “I can’t say.” By the way, Comey said he got special permission to reveal this investigation. Who gave him that special permission? He said he went to the Department of Justice. Who’s over there? Who runs that? That it would be Jeff Sessions.

The Trump administration itself granted permission for Comey to announce this today. (interruption) Well, no. My point there is that there’s no attempted cover-up of anything going on there. The Trump administration could very well have said, Jeff Sessions could have said, “Comey, look, it’s just like you said last summer about Hillary: We don’t detail ongoing investigations.” But he today was given permission to do just that, and he’s running with it. And the whole point of this today — and, by the way, it doesn’t mean I’m not gonna go through this and give you what the real news of these hearings is today and what the backdrop of all this is.

Because there’s a really salient factor that’s driving this from the Democrat side that is never going to be reported or commented on, which I’m going to touch on myself today. But, as I say, the purpose of this is to further the narrative that Trump is illegitimate, that he should not be president, that his election was the result of tampering by the Russians. So the objective is that Trump either stops this reform business he’s got, stops this drain-the-swamp stuff, and starts letting the Washington Republicans run the town again, or they’re gonna impeach him.

That’s the message being sent today: “You either straighten up and fly right or you’re gone.”

“We’re coming for you,” is the message of these hearings today.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aed2f66bb:5c4d51:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Suzzanne Monk and Alexander Duvel, owners of Worlds of Music Chicago, said on “Fox &amp; Friends Weekend” that their Trump support is causing them to shut down their music store in April.

Monk said she was “outed” as a Trump supporter after she and her husband posted about the University of Illinois-Chicago rally that was shut down by protesters.

“We actually drew some attention from the left, and they ‘outed’ us at that point as Trump supporters,” Monk said.

Since being “outed,” Monk said she and Duvel have been subjected to online threats and a decline in business, adding that friends have been wary of recommending anyone to the store because they back President Donald Trump.

“[It was] like I was just becoming more of a liability to [friends] because they couldn’t associate or recommend my shop to do business simply because of their peer group being so seriously anti-Trump,” Duvel explained.

Monk added that many people the couple had known for a long time decided the two were white supremacists and xenophobes without any evidence other than they voted for Trump.

While Monk and Duvel are closing down the retail side of their store, they will now focus on online sales and repairs.

The government of Taiwan is planning to request the purchase of new fighter aircraft from the United States, The Guardian reported today, just as it completes the transfer of two decommissioned U.S. Navy frigates. The move comes amid concerns that the Communist Party in Beijing is seeking to crack down on the pro-independence government of President Tsai Ing-wen.

The Guardian cites Taiwanese Defense Minister Feng Shih-kuan as alerting the nation’s legislature that his government is seeking to purchase more modern aircraft to replace its currently fleet of F-16s. Feng’s request for more modern aircraft was a response to a review of Taiwan’s defense capabilities recently released by his ministry and published every four years. The review warned that the Chinese government had significantly expanded its ability to attack Taiwan is necessary. China has invested heavily in military construction in the South China Sea, particularly in regions that are not sovereign Chinese territory but China insists has belonged to them since ancient times.”

The fighter jet purchases are part of a greater proposed defense spending increase in the year’s budget. The South China Morning Post reports that Taiwan is looking to increase its defense spending from two to three percent of its GDP in 2018, a high not seen since 1999. This would mean spending up to $11.4 billion on defense. Tsai’s predecessor, the Kuomintang Party’s Ma Jing-yeou, took a conciliatory approach to relations with Beijing.

The Guardian notes that China is proposing a seven percent increase in its defense spending to $151 billion.

The budget announcement also featured the revelation that Taiwan was now capable of launching missiles that can hit the Chinese mainland, a distance of nearly one thousand miles.

Taiwan recently expanded its naval capability by receiving two decommissioned American Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates, who began their sail out of American port on March 9. The frigates are expected to begin active duty for the Taiwanese defense forces in May.

The Chinese government appears concerned with Taiwan’s moves to protect itself from a mainland invasion. State propaganda outlet Global Times published a column Friday warning Taipei to abandon hopes of being recognized as a sovereign nation and instead accept the status China insists it has as a rogue province. “No soldiers believe Taiwan forces are capable to defend the island if the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) launches a comprehensive offensive against Taiwan,” the column reads. “As long as the Tsai government accepts of the 1992 Consensus, the island’s security will be ensured. The eight-year-tenure of Ma Ying-Jeou is the most secure period Taiwan has enjoyed since entering the 21st century.”

“Therefore, the most important thing for Taiwan is not to provoke the one-China policy. This is the correct political way to protect the island’s security,” the column concludes.

Taiwan did just that late last year following the election of President Donald Trump in the United States. President Tsai called Trump to congratulate him on his election victory and Trump, in an unprecedented move, accepted the call, implying he understood Tsai to be a fellow head of state. The Chinese communist government condemned Tsai and insisted in assurances from Washington that the Trump administration would not abandon the “One China” policy, which demands foreign nations also deny Taiwan’s sovereignty. Trump reportedly agreed to the One China policy in a February phone call with President Xi Jinping.

Tsai, meanwhile, has insisted on respect for her nation’s self-governance. In a speech in January, Tsai condemned Beijing for “going back to the old path of dividing, coercing, and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan.” “For the sake of safeguarding regional peace and prosperity, I want to once again reiterate that our commitments will not change, and our goodwill will not change. But we will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,” she promised.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aec374fa5:424faa:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

California Gov. Jerry Brown asked President Donald Trump on Sunday for federal emergency assistance for the fourth time in just two months since the new administration took office, putting the nascent “CalExit” movement in a difficult position.

While advocates of California secession — both on the left and operating from abroad — have hoped to make the case that the Golden State can stand on its own, Brown’s repeated requests for help underline the fact that the world’s sixth-biggest economy is still dependent on the rest of the country.

The latest request, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, asks for money for flood relief, including for repairing the damaged spillways of the Oroville Dam, which nearly failed last month, resulting in the temporary evacuation of 200,000 residents downstream of the dam.

Desperate last-minute engineering maneuvers — including a massive release of water from the dam down an already-damaged main spillway — averted a collapse of the emergency spillway.

The Chronicle adds: “The Governor’s Office of Emergency Services has also requested assistance from the U.S. Small Business Administration for individuals in Colusa, Lake, Lassen, Plumas, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties, where the flooding from February storms damaged more than 200 homes and businesses.”

All three of Brown’s previous requests for aid have been granted.

Brown has vowed to stand up to the Trump administration on left-wing causes such as climate change and illegal immigration. At the same time, he has welcomed the commitment of the Trump administration to invest in infrastructure, although the White House has signaled that such spending would not include California’s controversial and costly high-speed rail project.

On Monday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” co-host Mika Brzezinski stated that she thinks President Trump “has ADD or something, and he’s just not even there.”

Fellow co-host former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough stated, “I find it spectacularly clumsy, short-sided, some might even say stupid to not shake the hand of the — your most important ally in Europe.” During Scarborough’s criticism of Trump, Brzezinski interjected, “Buffoon-like?” She further stated, “And he can’t say he didn’t hear it. Just for the record, it wasn’t just her saying would you like to do a handshake. Was he out of it, somewhere else?”

After Washington Post columnist David Ignatius argued Trump refused the handshake to “stick it to” the Germans, Brzezinski responded, “I honestly don’t think he thinks that hard.” She added, “I have a different hypothesis. I think he’s thinking about what he’s going to eat for dinner. I don’t think he’s even there, honestly. I think he has ADD or something, and he’s just not even there. He was out of it.”

President Donald Trump appeared disappointed as the news media continued to focus on the ongoing investigation of whether his campaign had improper ties with Russia during the election.

“James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it! “ Trump wrote on Twitter early Monday morning.

Trump again argued that the Russia story was a narrative “made up” by the Democrats for their failures to win the presidential election.

“The real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information,” he wrote. “Must find leaker now!”

The New York Times reports that the investigation is ongoing, but that there is no evidence showing that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election.

“American officials say they have so far found no proof of that,” a story printed on Monday admitted.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aebc914c0:36c0c2:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) predicted on New York AM 970’s “The Cats Roundtable” that Judge Neil Gorsuch will be confirmed this week after hearings to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Graham called Gorsuch “one of the big prizes” that came with President Donald Trump’s election, adding that he is “one of the smartest people” he has ever met.

“I think he is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met. We’re going to hopefully pass him out of the judiciary committee the week of March 20,” Graham told show host John Catsimatidis.

A phalanx of immigration judges will be temporarily re-assigned to 12 U.S. cities to help speed deportations of illegal aliens, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed on Friday.

The full plan of the reassignments is still in the works, and the DOJ is looking for volunteers among immigration judges before going forward, according to Reuters.

Cities the DOJ want to staff up includes New York; Los Angeles; Miami; New Orleans; San Francisco; Baltimore, Bloomington, Minnesota; El Paso, Texas; Harlingen, Texas; Imperial, California; Omaha, Nebraska, and Phoenix, Arizona, the news service says.

This isn’t the first move to beef up immigration judge staff. Early in March the Trump administration also began sending judges to immigrant detention centers to speed up services.

The initial plan came on the heels of a Department of Homeland Security memo that requested the Trump administration allow federal immigration courts to use “expedited deportation proceedings” for any illegal immigrants living in the U.S. for two years or less. The process is currently limited to those only living in the U.S. for up to two weeks.

According to data provided by the Justice Department’s Executive Office of Immigration Review, there are up to 18,013 pending immigration cases in the cities targeted by the DOJ plan.

The plan serves as another plank in President Trump’s promise to step up the deportations that ground to a halt during the last years of the Obama administration. It also marks a shift from Obama’s practice of deporting only illegals convicted of serious crimes — and even many of those were never deported.

Critics of the plan claim that “reshuffling” the judges will only cause a backlog at the courts that lost one of their judges

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” while answering questions about President Donald Trump’s “America First Budget,” Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney said the Trump administration was showing “compassion” in terms of where the money comes from by no longer asking coal miners in West Virginia to pay for the National Endowment for the Arts.

Mulvaney said, “The president knows who the voters are. His voters are folks who pay taxes as well. And I think or the first time in a long time, you have an administration looking at the compassion of both sides of the equation. Not just the compassion in terms of where the money go but in terms of where the money comes from. Could we as an administration, could I as a budget director look at a coal miner in West Virginia and say I want you to give money to the federal government so I can give it to the National Endowment for the Arts. We finally got to the point in the administration where we couldn’t do that. You owe $60,000 to the government. So do I in terms of the debt. The president said let’s take care of both sides of the equation.”

President Trump’s “America First” budget targets a number of controversial California programs and notorious agencies for heavy cuts or outright elimination—while increasing funding for border security and detention of criminal aliens.

The 62-page spending plan released Thursday outlines the president’s priorities to Congress. The plan is likely to give Trump supporters plenty to cheer—while making Democrats and political insiders groan.

Border security is one area that President Trump has put his money where his mouth is. Almost $4.8 billion in increased border infrastructure (i.e. “the wall”) and enforcement of immigration laws represent a dramatic increase in funding, which will benefit California more than any other state.

The proposed funding includes:

$2.6 Billion to fund building the wall

$314 million to hire 500 more U.S. Border Patrol agents and 1,000 additional U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents

$15 million to make the E-Verify work authorization program mandatory

$1.5 billion over the prior year’s budget for detention and removal of unauthorized immigrants (this could mean larger-capacity detention centers, such as one in Adelanto in San Bernardino County).

One idea in Trump’s budget that has been less than popular with law enforcement is the proposed elimination of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), which reimburses local sheriffs and police departments close to $210 million per year for detaining criminal aliens for more than 4 days in a local jail.

Every president since Clinton created the program has marked it for elimination, but so far it has survived — in large part because it has been become a reliable funding stream for local law enforcement when state and country resources are scarce.

The bipartisan push-back on scrapping SCAAP in California will likely be fierce, because California — home to more criminal aliens than any other state — receives the lion’s share of the funding.

The Sacramento Bee reported the hysterical reactions of California’s U.S. Senators, both Democrats. Sen Dianne Feinstein said: “It’s an absolute travesty for California and every state or community that thought they had a true partner in the federal government.” Sen. Kamala Harris claimed: “It’s clear from this proposal, President Trump does not value government’s essential functions of public health, public safety, and public education.”

According to an NPR report aired on 89.3 KPCC (and NPR, too, faces an end to federal funding), President Trump wants to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by almost a third (31 percent), and “put states in charge of enforcing federal environmental laws, which is a philosophy championed by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.”

If states want to go above and beyond Federal EPA requirements, they’re welcome to do so — as long as they can fund it.

Trump’s focus on EPA funding is significant to California, since CalEPA receives almost 12% of its funding from the federal government. The heavy-handed enforcement tactics of state agencies like the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) could be dramatically curtailed by the cuts.

Other proposed cuts include $250 million to California to a teacher’s training program that did not meet the approval of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. According to the Los Angeles Times, DeVos said, “Taxpayers deserve to know their dollars are being spent efficiently and effectively.

While California will be harder hit than any other state by the proposed cuts — with the elimination of some programs and severe cuts to others — there may be a light at the end of the tunnel.

By scaling back the size of funding to CalEPA and therefore cutting CARB and other job-killing bureaucracies, and actually securing the border rather than simply funding programs like SCAAP as token reimbursement, President Trump is arguably sending a signal that he’s serious about real-world results — not the paper progress favored by government program administrators anxious to justify the existence of their programs.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae933cea4:2f78b:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON—Senate Judicial Committee members will decide this week whether to propel Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, in what would be a lasting and major victory for President Donald Trump.

At 11:00 AM on Monday, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) will gavel the Senate Judiciary Committee to order for the Gorsuch confirmation hearings. The entire day is expected to consist of opening statements by the committee members.

Gorsuch will be the sole witness before the committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, giving millions of Americans an opportunity to hear from the nominee in his own words.

Outside witnesses will then testify before the committee on Thursday, with both friendly and hostile witnesses.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) suggested strong Democratic opposition to Gorsuch, arguing that the current federal appeals judge “harbors a right-wing, pro-corporate, special interest agenda.” However, no line of attack has gained significant traction. The polished and genial Colorado native appears on a clear path to confirmation.

Tentative plans currently call for a committee vote on the nomination on April 3. The White House and Senate Republicans hope to have a final vote of the full Senate to confirm Gorsuch on April 10, in time for the new justice to participate in the Supreme Court’s last two-week sitting of this annual term, which will begin on April 17.

President Donald Trump said in an interview Saturday night that he would happily challenge Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in 2020, calling that scenario “a dream come true.”

“I think she would lose so badly,” Trump told Fox News’ Jesse Watters. “She hurt Hillary Clinton very badly” in the 2016 presidential election, the president stated.

Warren, who has captured the hearts of progressives, was a high-profile campaign surrogate for Clinton during the 2016 election and appeared side-by-side with Clinton in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire.

“I watched that last couple weeks, where she was getting up with that craziness and anger,” Trump said of Warren’s final few appearances on the campaign trail. “They are hard. I said, ‘She is bad for Hillary.&apos;”

“Pocahontas would not be proud of her as her representative, believe me,” Trump continued, bringing up a nickname for Warren that he used from time-to-time on the campaign trail.

Watters suggested that Warren would “probably run against” Trump in 2020.

“I hope so,” Trump responded. “That would be a dream come true.”

Warren has attacked Trump on the campaign trail, calling Trump a “nasty, thin-skinned fraud” during the American Constitution Society convention in Washington in June.

She has continued to attack Trump after he assumed the presidency, most recently for Trump’s decision to fire Obama-era federal prosecutor Preet Bharara, when she said the president wants a bunch of “tame prosecutors who won’t investigate him.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae9182f5b:36e:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” while discussing the current House Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, News One Now host Roland Martin said President Donald Trump ” hoodwinked,” “bamboozled” and “led astray” white working-class voters.

A new report in the Orange County Register suggests that Republican Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) of San Diego has turned to the left after nearly losing his congressional seat in the 2016 election, in a state where being anti-Trump may help (or not).

“He is certainly changing his message to appeal to moderates and even left-leaning Democrats,” Graeme Boushey, a UC Irvine political scientist, told the Register. “I think he’s making a calculated political decision and maybe a correct one. He was disliked by the same voters he’s trying to win over now. It’s a hard pivot to make and sell to voters, but it’s very practical.”

Issa was one of President Donald Trump’s biggest supporters in the election (after initially supporting Sen. Marco Rubio). However, he has recently become critical of certain members of Trump’s Cabinet, and has distanced himself from the commander-in-chief on issues such as alleged Russian collusion during the campaign (for which there is no evidence).

Breitbart News previously reported that Issa’s campaign had conducted an internal poll that showed a 10-point drop in his favorability ratings between mid-October and early December, which was in part attributed to his support for President Donald Trump.

Issa narrowly defeated Democrat Doug Applegate by a mere 0.6 percent (or 1,600 votes) in November. Applegate has indicated his intention to run again in 2018.

The Register notes that Issa’s decline in popularity has resulted in a policy shift to the left. The publication reported, “Despite a lifetime legislative score of just 4 percent from the League of Conservation Voters, Issa also told the crowd that he also opposed any reduction in funding to the Environmental Protection Agency. Two days later, the same politician who’s said there’s no consensus on climate change joined the House Climate Solutions Caucus.”

Issa, who is pro-life, reportedly also told constituents during his March 11 town all that he opposed calls from his fellow Republicans to defund Planned Parenthood. He has also pushed back against the Republican Party’s proposed replacement of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

Although Issa’s district is a traditionally a Republican stronghold, it has begun trending blue. However, not every Republican who broke with Trump to appease voters has succeeded. Scott Jones, who ran for Congress in the 7th district last year, suffered defeat to incumbent Rep. Ami Bera (D-CA) after he broke with Trump late in the campaign.

Conversely, others in the GOP have stuck with President Trump, who has remained popular with Republicans and among many conservative voters.

Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said if the Republicans and President Donald Trump repeal and replace Obamacare and premiums continue to rise “people will be ready to tar and feather us in the streets.”

Cruz said,”My biggest concern with the House bill is it doesn’t lower premiums.”

He added, “If Republicans hold a big press conference and pat ourselves on the back that we have repealed Obamacare, and everyone’s premiums keep going up, people will be ready to tar and feather us in the streets and quite rightly.”

Polls are not accurate quantifiers of public opinion when leftists savagely attack voters for supporting President Donald Trump, New York Times-bestselling author Ann Coulter told Breitbart News on Sunday.

CNN had unveiled a push poll on Friday claiming voters support amnesty for illegal aliens and oppose President Donald Trump’s enforcement of immigration law in a blatant attempt to warp public opinion. One of the poll’s “findings” showed allegedly 90 percent want to give illegal aliens citizenship if they agree to hypothetical requirements.

“I only read through the first 3 or 4 poll questions and noticed that the percentage of poll respondents opposed to enforcing our immigration laws has SKYROCKETED in the last year,” Coulter said. “In that same time period, the hysteria and violence on the left has reached epic proportions.”

“We just had a presidential election where the polls were useless because poll respondents were afraid to admit—even to computerized telephone polls!—that they were voting for Trump,” she continued.

In a poll surveying 1,025 adults from Mar. 1 to Mar. 4 (margin of error plus or minus three percentage points), CNN/ORC pollsters asked which of three options should be the government’s top priority: 1) “Deporting immigrants already in the U.S. illegally,” 2) “Developing a plan to stop immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally,” or 3) “Developing a plan to allow those in the U.S. illegally who have jobs to become legal residents.” Sixty percent chose amnesty, while 26 percent said the government should work to halt illegal immigration, and 13 percent said the government should deport all illegals.

In a ham-handed attempt to manipulate public opinion, pollsters asked: “Do you think the government should attempt to deport all people currently living in the country illegally or should the government not attempt to do that?”

Given the choice of rounding up tens of millions of illegals at gunpoint and loading them into the back of black SUVs heading to the Mexican border or not, 71 percent said they would not like the government to do that. (Twenty-seven percent are open to the idea after years of violent mayhem and suppressed wages.) CNN used this false dichotomy to blast the headline: “CNN/ORC poll: Americans break with Trump on immigration policy.”

But no one will honestly answer pollsters as long as leftists are pepper-spraying, beating, egging, and terrorizing anyone open to the idea of enforcing immigration laws, Coulter told Breitbart News.

“As long as we live in a country where liberals are going to violently attack anyone who disagrees with them, what is the point of polling?” Coulter asked. “The left’s recent eruptions of rage, lies and fascistic violence has resulted in a populace where no one wants to upset the little darlings. We may as well admit that in the current environment, public policy polls are useless.”

“The big announcement of the meaningless results are intended to make people think they must be nuts if they disagree with La Raza (‘the race!’) and the NYT editorial page. Which is weird, since DONALD TRUMP WAS JUST ELECTED PRESIDENT,” she said.

Indeed, the open borders lobby and its media allies seized on the poll and began spreading CNN’s headline on Twitter:

While one side of the debate is quite literally beaten into submission and silence, the other side pretends they have won. Coulter said that the Left explodes with violence as soon as the slightest limits on immigration are proposed:

Who could have imagined that a temporary travel ban on poverty-stricken, non-English-speaking, welfare-needing immigrants from 7 TERRORIST-PRODUCING countries would incite liberals to engage in nationwide protests — and then celebrate when courts intervene to continue the flow of poverty-stricken, non-English-speaking, welfare-needing immigrants from 7 TERRORIST-PRODUCING countries. Apparently the only answer that won’t get you punched or your business burnt down is: YES PLEASE DESTROY AMERICA ASAP! I ALWAYS WANTED TO LIVE IN GUADALAJARA — AND ALSO UNDER SHARIA LAW! DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH!

“And yes, the [CNN poll] Qs are silly, but still, the recent alleged change in public opinion, and the complete failure of polls having anything to do with Trump, is even more striking,” she said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae7ca259c:955256:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump’s first on page 11 labeled, “America First,” ends federal funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) — which, in turn, supports National Public Radio (NPR) and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).

The left is howling, and local public radio stations are already campaigning to oppose the move. Democrats are spamming supporters with fundraising emails. Yet there are several reasons that ending federal funding for NPR and PBS is a great idea.

1. They do not need the money. In 2011, James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas secretly recorded senior NPR executives meeting with a potential donor and admitting that NPR “would be better off in the long run without federal funding.” NPR reports that it “receives less than 2 percent of its budget directly from CPB,” and has long anticipated the possibility of losing that.

2. Big Bird doesn’t work there anymore. In 2015, Sesame Street‘s production company signed a deal with HBO. The first HBO-hosted shows began in 2016, and only aired nine months later on PBS for children from less affluent households.

3. NPR is biased in favor of liberals and against conservatives. NPR’s political coverage is consistently slanted against Republicans and conservatives, and in favor of liberals. The network also takes aim at conservative rivals: last week, for example, it accused Breitbart News, falsely, of producing “fake news.” It also churns out such fare as Code Switch, which often reinforces racial identity. Using taxpayer funds to support one-sided news coverage is an abuse of taxpayer money.

4. PBS no longer produces content worth public investment. As Steven Titch noted recently at The Hill:

It has superb shows, such as Downton Abbey, Sherlock and Frontline. But as Sesame Street’s defection demonstrated, most of these programs could easily find a place on commercial cable and streaming outlets. The remainder of PBS programming approaches self-parody: examples such as Golf’s Grand Design, Great Old Amusement Parks and Andre Rieu: Waltzing Forever. The argument for public television—that it offers an exclusive place for quality content and entertainment that would be too narrow, too marginal and too unprofitable for commercial TV—is risible in an age of hundreds of cable channels and near-unlimited streaming.

5. Conservatives have been promising to cut funding for decades. Newt Gingrich and the Republican Revolution of 1994 wanted to cut federal funding for PBS and NPR, but failed. When the Tea Party took over the House in 2010, they likewise failed to pass the promised cuts. This time, conservatives control both houses of Congress.

The taxpayers helped launch NPR and PBS. It is well past time to let them go. They will probably do better on their own — and be less of a political target.

Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” while discussing President Donald Trump’s tweets accusing former President Barack Obama’s administration of wiretapping Trump Tower before the election, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Trump should apologize to Obama.

Pelosi said, “It’s not just about this allegation that President Trump has made It’s about the frivolity of it all. I call him the Deflector-in-Chief. He’ll come up with anything to change the subject from something that’s not going well for him.”

She continued, “He comes up with these schemes, which are beneath the dignity – not only beneath the dignity of the office of the president, beneath the responsibility of the President of the United States to respect the office he serves in.”

When asked if Trump should apologize to Obama, Pelosi said, “Yes he most certainly should and to the American people,”

This week Congressman Steve King of Iowa made the following comment on his Twitter account about the outcome of the Dutch election contest between nationalist candidate Geert Wilders and the incumbent socialist Prime Minister:

Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.

By the ensuing mud fight, you would think Congressman King had praised the beheading of children or “honor killings.” But, no: King had only committed a crime against “diversity” by saying American culture is different and is worth saving.

Geert Wilders’ party did not win a majority in the Dutch national parliamentary elections on March 11 – actually, no party did– but he did increase his party’s share of the popular vote by about 30 percent. That means his views are attracting growing support, and to applaud that trend that arouses anger among progressives –and yes, hatred—against Steve King. Wilders is a leader among Europeans seeking to halt unrestricted immigration by millions of Muslims fleeing the Middle East’s civil wars and terrorist violence.

Steve King Is watching the slow collapse of European civilization and suggesting that the United States follow a different course. Perhaps if his Republican critics bothered to examine the demographic assault on Europe they would not be so quick to condemn his Paul Revere-like warning.

Turkish President Erdogan tells Muslims in Europe to have “at least five children,” because, “You are the future of Europe.” Do you think Erdogan is planning to win the 2040 World Cup—or something more “comprehensive.” If the Muslim Brotherhood has its way, it is the future of America as well.

Congressman King was attacked mercilessly for “racist Twitter comments.” Really? “Racist”? Must every difference of opinion on important matters be reduced to a duel between white hat progressives and black hat “racists”? What is going on here?

First to attack Congressman King were the knee-jerk slander-mongers like the Southern Policy Law Center, The New York Times, and the usual gang bangers.

But the leftist watchtowers of political correctness were soon joined by mainstream media assassins, who painted a picture of a “white nationalist” politician who deserved to be pilloried as an enemy of diversity and civil rights.

After the initial attacks, Rep. King went on CNN to defend his remarks. In an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, King explained:

[I] meant exactly what I said. You cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else’s babies. You’ve got to keep your birth rate up, and you need to teach your children your values.

That is shocking: Congressman King believes parents should teach their children their values. Wow. Now there’s a radical idea. The globalists at CNN evidently think parents should either not teach values at all or should teach someone else’s values. Whose values? Maybe the values of the UN Human Rights Commission? Or the values spewed out bilingually by dual-citizen Jose Ramos at Univision?

But, wait: something here does not add up. King wasn’t being attacked for advocating less immigration. He was attacked for saying our nation would be better off if we reproduced our own children and our own values—which implies—oh, my, God—implies our values might be superior to imported values!

Okay, not everyone agrees with that, but how is it “racist”?

Don’t American-born babies come in all colors and all races?

Isn’t the United States the most diverse country in the world in the number of languages and races represented in our public schools and our arts and entertainment?

How is proposing that all of the millions of multi-racial Americans have more babies “racist”?

Are Catholics racist if they oppose abortion—even if more black babies are aborted in New York City than are born there?

We have entered an era of pseudo-progressivism when opposition to any progressive policy – such as unrestricted migration across open borders, or unrestricted access to public welfare benefits — is pilloried and slandered as “racist.” This new high-brow censorship is hailed as “progress,” when in reality, it is a hallmark of totalitarian repression.

Steve King did not say that only white Americans should have more babies; he wants more American babies, period. Yes, that’s an example of putting “America First,” and you can either agree or disagree with it. But to slander it as racist is, well, plainly un-American.

Congressman King’s statements were not racist any more than people who want secure borders are “anti-immigrant.” Immigrants are people who arrive legally after a long process that takes many years. Proposing that there be no restrictions on who enters our country — and that we must take in all migrants who appear on our borders — is not a “humanitarian” policy, it is an unforgivably destructive and dangerous one.

The ongoing debate over how many and what kind of immigrants America needs should be a policy debate, not a back-alley brawl, but that is what the globalists are doing—dragging everyone into a brawl. We have seen it over and over again, this orchestrated orgy or character assassination aimed at silencing all dissent from the globalist, multicultural agenda.

If America is already the world’s “melting pot,” then the sons and daughters born inside that caldron of intercultural assimilation will necessarily represent those same races and colors. So, exactly how is it “racist” or “white nationalist” to suggest we need to pass on our values to the next generation of Americans — and not rely on young adults arriving from other cultures?

How is Steve King’s statements any different than the values expressed in President Trump’s “American First” inaugural address? Of course, they are not, and indeed, attacking King is another way of attacking President Trump’s nationalism.

Too many establishment Republicans run for the tall grass when an ounce of moral courage is needed. Republican criticism of Congressman King came quickly from some of the media’s favorite “go-to” sources when patriotic heretics are spotted on the horizon. Quick on the draw was a “Gang-of-Eight” amnesty bill supporter, Florida congresswoman Ileana Ross-Lehtinen, who went to her Twitter tool to attack King, “Get a clue…. Diversity is our strength.” Oh, but, let’s not have too much diversity in Congress. Iowa has got to go!

Other Republicans who joined the lynch mob were current House Speaker Paul Ryan. “The speaker clearly disagrees and believes America’s long history of inclusiveness is one of its great strengths,” spokesperson Ashlee Strong said.

Representative King is simply the latest victim of the merchants of globalism. His language may have been a little crude, but his point was not only valid but a necessary caution against the bitter fruit of open borders anarchy.

The attempt to slander and demonize Steve King is more than an attack on a well-known “border hawk.” The vitriol hurled at Congressman King is more intense than normal not because he is criticizing other nations or other cultures – he did not do that– but because he is praising our own culture and values—American values—and saying we must preserve those values. THAT is what is unforgivable in “post-racial America.”

Congressman King has touched a raw nerve and the progressive globalist counterattack has been visceral. To the American left, it is now racist to believe American values are worth defending, worth teaching to our children, worth preserving for future generations. Anyone who speaks out in praise of American values or suggests American values may be in danger of eclipse from massive immigration without cultural assimilation—that person and those ideas must be rejected, then marginalized, and then destroyed.

I am proud to call Congressman Steve King my friend. Americans who care about constitutional liberty and the independence of the American homeland should care equally about preserving the unique culture that undergirds those liberties and our national sovereignty. That uniquely American culture is not the one embodied in United Nations High Commission on Refugees, nor the one enforced by repression the People’s Republic of China, nor the culture enforced by religious persecution in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. And it is not the culture celebrated in Hollywood in Bill Maher’s condescending monologues.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae724ac0e:9970b3:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” while discussing the current Republican House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said, “I simply think that it’s not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country.”

Partial transcript as follows:

TAPPER: Turning to Obamacare, you’ve been very critical of the bill supported by our previous guest Dr. Price, President Trump, House Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. You’ve warned that this bill could put the House Republican majority at risk. One major concern about the plan is the way it might impact lower income Americans. You come fromArkansass which is one of the poorest states in the country. If you were designing the plan on your own, would you get rid of theMedicaidd expansion that brought coverage to 250,000 people in your state?

COTTON: Jake, first, let me say I served with Tom Price in the House of Representatives and consider him a good friend. He had legislation as a congress congressman that I think is a lot better than the house bill currently under consideration. TheMedicaidd expansion I think needs to be part of Medicaid transformation and that’s what the house bill moved forward. It can be improved to some degree, but it’s about a 70% or 80% solution, Jake. the bigger problem with this legislation is on the private insurance market. I simply think that it’s not going to work to bring down premiums in Arkansas or for working Americans around the country. We need to roll our sleeves and fix those problems rear than trying to rush to some arbitrary deadline.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae724ac0e:9970b1:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

CAIRO (Reuters) – Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will make his first state visit to Washington during the first week of April at the invitation of U.S. President Donald Trump, Egyptian state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram reported on Sunday.

The trip will be Sisi’s first U.S. state visit since being elected president in 2014 as former U.S. President Barack Obama had never extended an invitation.

Sisi was elected a year after leading the military’s ousting of the Muslim Brotherhood’s President Mohamed Mursi after mass protests. Trump invited Sisi in January but the date of the visit had not been announced.

Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify, and Uber are missing from a group of 58 tech companies now signed onto an amicus brief protesting President Donald Trump’s travel delay executive order on immigration.

Lyft, Airbnb, and Dropbox are among the 58 companies that have filed an amicus brief in support of the Hawaii lawsuit challenging Trump’s revised travel order, according to the Verge. That’s down from 97 tech companies that signed onto an amicus brief last month to challenge Trump’s original executive order restricting travel from seven countries that had been determined under the Obama Administration as harbors of terrorism.

On March 6, President Trump signed a revised executive order entitled, “Protecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States.” The order replaced a prior order signed in late January which had been halted in the court system by way of a temporary restraining order. The revised order temporarily restricted travel from a reduced six countries.

Last Wednesday a ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii halted implementation of the new order, according to NPR. Watson claimed that the state of Hawaii was likely to succeed in its challenge of the order based on claims of religious discrimination and injury to businesses, universities, and tourism in the state. The state argued that imam Ismail Elshikh’s mother-in-law in Syria would be barred from entering the U.S. The mother-in-law has not visited the U.S. in 12 years, according to Byron York’s column in the Washington Examiner.

“Since the dawn of the digital age and the proliferation of the Internet, the amici technology companies and thousands of other businesses throughout the American economy have prospered and grown through the hard work, innovation, and genius of immigrants and refugees,” begins the Background section of the brief. The brief goes on to state, “Never in modern American history has that infusion of talent and passion and creativity been stanched, as it is vital to the lifeblood of our economy. Never, until now.”

The Hawaii ruling was followed within hours by a court ruling in Maryland against the EO. The Justice Department has already stated that it will challenge the Maryland ruling, according to CNBC. Presidents Barack Obama, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan each used the federal powers granted the President to control immigration in certain instances.

On Saturday’s “Justice” on Fox News Channel, Ann Coulter, author of “In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” noted the Democratic party’s hypocrisy for being upset over the alleged ties between Russia and President Donald Trump while former DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile fed Hillary Clinton confidential questions for an upcoming primary debate.

“It’s starting to look like the reason the Democrats are so upset about this alleged Russian interference in the election is because they think they are the only ones who should be able to fix elections,” Coulter told host Judge Jeanine Pirro.

Albert Einstein said, “Ethical axioms are found and tested not very differently from the axioms of science. Truth is what stands the test of experience [experiment].” Since this Republic was first gifted to the world, ours has been a quest to prove to mankind that the world’s great experiment in freedom, “a government of the people” can long endure. In any experiment, controlling for variables and clarity of result is vital .

The construct of our founding fathers and our Constitution was a system of open government where issues and decisions were debated before the world and the votes, actions, or overreach of each government representative were meticulously recorded and presented to the American people who could then have the clarity to hold them accountable in the next election (i.e. Obamacare). Thus, our experiment in freedom could control for variables and identify a clear result that could be clearly considered by all Americans. If we truly believe in the consent of the governed, then the governed must have clarity as to who and what they are giving their consent. There is nothing more basic to government of the people or the survival of this Republic than this clarity.

Unfortunately, a little over 20 years ago, clarity of government was dramatically eroded in an already esoteric U.S. Senate when the rare practice of invoking the 60-vote rule on the motion to proceed to consider (to allow a bill to brought to the Senate floor for debate and amendment), became the norm. Unlike the 60-vote rule for debate cloture to get to a final vote (which gives the minority the power to extend and even perpetuate debate), this more recent application of the 60-vote rule gave the minority the power of continuous filibuster to prevent any consequential bill from being brought to the floor at all. Interesting. Two applications of the 60-vote rule; one to extend debate indefinitely, and one to prevent it completely. To logically defend one of these applications, is to fundamentally eviscerate the other. Those who would ignore this glaring paradox and still herald the sacred principle of 60 votes in the Senate then have the attending sacred responsibility to do away with the “sacrilegious” reconciliation procedure, since, once in a budget year, it circumvents the revered 60-vote requirement. Thus, these two core principles are antithetically juxtaposed.

Carefully analyzed, the practical effect of the 60-vote no-debate rule in the Senate (which could be made non-debatable without affecting the 60-vote cloture allowing a final vote on passage) is perpetual stalemate without clarity or accountability. Ironically, this is a disincentive to consensus and it all but ensures frequent swapping of majorities, not on the basis of the policies defeated or enacted, but out of sheer frustration on the part of an American people who are thus, more and more divorced from understanding and participating in the nation’s substantive policy considerations.

To the rescue, in this complex debate, come the excerpted solutions of no less than an experienced Senate Majority and Senate Minority Leader: “The country can’t be run this way, where nothing gets done.” … “Unless after this election there is a dramatic change to go back to the way it used to be” (before the “no-debate stealth filibuster”) “the Senate will have to evolve as it has in the past” … “But it will evolve with a majority vote determining stuff. It is going to happen” (emphasis mine), meaning that the majority, not 60 votes, would rule.

These are not the words of Leader Mitch McConnell, but those of Harry Reid when he assumed Hillary Clinton would be President and Senator Schumer would be Majority Leader. Senator Schumer refused to comment and will likely continue to refuse. However, after such unequivocal statements to the contrary, to predicate America’s future on the hope that Democrats will suddenly be seized with an epiphany of fair play toward Republicans and not follow through with Mr. Reid’s plan, when given the chance, is to risk the survival of this Republic on a hope that has never manifest in the past.

As now practiced, the minority in the U.S. Senate, by doing absolutely nothing, with almost no accountability accruing to them (using the “no-debate stealth filibuster”), can easily and nearly always either stop every legislative effort, or far more insidiously, sabotage it by requiring a “dirt and ice cream” result. This is especially true for the appropriations process (with profound implications for the Article One Constitutional Power of the Purse). Clarity and principle never have a chance to be seen, and the people never know who to blame or support. This is the most pernicious and dangerous element of the no-debate stealth filibuster. Unfortunately, nearly every major piece of legislation supported by the Trump Administration is on course to face this same fate. Long-term, this means political nirvana for Democrats, anathema for Republicans, and continued chaos and lack of clarity for America. It will be interesting to see what Donald Trump’s tweets look like when he fully understands this reality as he most certainly will.

Elite intellectuals and sentinels of Senate tradition will tell President Trump and all of us mere mortals that we just do not understand the sage intricacies and distinguished traditions of the complex and ever evolving Senate rules. They now have a clarion responsibility to also tell us their plan, under those rules in this political age of polarization, in these, rare but fleeting, days of unified Republican government, to enact the policies necessary to save America before Harry Reid’s dreams and Mitch McConnell’s nightmares come true. Few things could damn the institution or this Republic more.

The jury is out as to whether Democrats will insist on an extended filibuster on the confirmation of Supreme Court Nominee, Neil Gorsuch. To do so would clearly expose their abuse of the 60-vote “no-deliberation” rule with such clarity to the nation that it will be more difficult for them to use it (as they most certainly intend) to block or sabotage every major piece of legislation during the next four years no matter how important it is to the country.

Rather than to deal with 60-vote no debate rule forthrightly in the Senate, House Republicans are now forced to try to repeal and replace Obama care through reconciliation. We will do our best. However, reconciliation means the legislation will have to fit through the “Byrd Rule.” Unless it is reinterpreted by someone (like Mike Pence) presiding over the Senate, the present construal of the Byrd Rule will not allow for full repeal or full replacement. This means that the legislation that emerges will not be a true consensus plan among or between Democrats and Republicans. Senate rules will once again have obscured and subordinated best policy considerations. Republicans’ quest to produce a policy facilitating an innovative, market-based American system that empowers patients, respects healthcare providers, and provides the greatest number of people the best healthcare in the world, in the most cost effective way, will fall short of its goal. Americans will not have clarity. Political culprits will escape accountability and the result will be legislation that neither fully repeals nor replaces Obamacare. Republicans will now own it just as it is imploding, and conscientious souls will risk brain damage trying to understand what and how it all happened.

The Founding Fathers could have made provision for the King of England to filibuster the Declaration of Independence (just in case the revolutionary war went the other way). It certainly would have been far safer for them. However, if they had, the world might never have known what freedom looked like. Republicans must not now accept an equation of never being able to do good, noble and necessary things for this country today in the hope that it might prevent Democrats from doing bad things to it in the future. To risk nothing will be to risk everything.

It is possible that changing the 60-vote rule or its practice in the Senate may one day prove disastrous, but we fail the test of our time if we allow that fear to blind us to the disasters that are certainly upon us in this moment. We are $20 trillion in debt. We are close to socialized medicine. The federal bureaucracy is growing out of control. The very foundations of the nation continue to be stained by the blood of over a million of its own preborn children every year. The Constitution hangs by a thread. The leading sponsor of terrorism in the world is on track to legally gain nuclear weapons. Our military and the nation’s place in the world in general have been devastated by the Obama years. The 60-vote rule did not empower Republicans to stop these things in the past when we were in the minority or the majority, but it does empower Democrats to prevent us from effectively addressing these dangerous realities in the present, anytime soon, or maybe…ever.

So, to those apprehensive Republicans who have come to the moment of quiet capitulation to a Senate rule that now prevents critical legislation from even being brought to the floor for debate and amendment before the American people under regular order, let me take a load off your mind and encourage you just to relax. If Americans watch Donald Trump and a unified Republican government willingly allow ourselves to gridlocked again, given all the implications, and after all of our promises, Democrats will very likely regain control of American government sooner than we would ever hope, and when they do, as Mr. Reid has so eloquently explained, this little filibuster problem will be resolved. Unfortunately, we then may have thrown away the greatest opportunity in modern history to do those things necessary to save this country for this and coming generations.

Vice President Mike Pence took the case for the Republican House Leadership’s American Health Care Act to the people again on Saturday.

Pence rallied Floridians with the promise of new amendments to the bill just one day after President Donald Trump announced that he flipped members of the Republican Study Committee from no votes on the bill to yes.

Pence sold the bill as “an important step in the right direction,” as he spoke from the floor of Mac Papers in Jacksonville, Florida. The Vice President had been involved in the Friday meeting with Trump and Republican Study Committee members. Gov. Rick Scott joined VP Pence at the rally, introducing him to the crowd.

From that warehouse, the Vice President previewed a few of the new amendments planned for the AHCA:

First off, we’re going to stop any more states from expanding Medicaid and adding a burden to future generations. We’re going to give states the option of block grants of Medicaid to the states so states like Florida can innovate and design Medicaid around the unique needs of the people in this community. And we’re going to allow states like Florida to include a work requirement for able-bodied adults ensuring that Medicaid’s benefits are available for those who need it the most.

Vice President Pence emphasized the importance of allowing states to determine the best way to give better coverage options for the people of their respective states. He added that the Trump Administration is, “going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines — the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance.”

Pence assured the crowd that Americans with preexisting conditions would still get coverage, as well as allowing adult children up to the age of 26 to remain on their parents’ health insurance. Both items have previously been touted as popular aspects of Obamacare.

“We’re going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system in America that makes affordable, high-quality health insurance accessible for every American,” he added.

Pence spoke as he has before of the battle over healthcare in Washington, D.C. and the challenge of getting the AHCA passed. “We’re counting on Florida,” Pence urged. “We need every Republican in Florida to support this bill and support the President’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.”

Before leaving, the Vice President pressed in hard to lobby listeners. He said, “We need every freedom-loving American who knew we could be stronger, who knew we could be better, who knew we could stand tall again to — yourselves — stand up and speak out.” He challenged the crowd to tell neighbors, friends, and people outside the drug store “how strongly you support the President’s vision for this country, particularly when it comes to healthcare.”

WASHINGTON – Critics of the Trump administration slammed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s comment that “all options are on the table” if North Korea elevates the threat of its nuclear weapons program.

“As Member of Foreign Affairs Cmte, I call on #Tillerson to stop making war-like stmts about N. Korea,” tweeted Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA).

But some Asia policy experts noted that that warning is not new, and certainly nothing to get hysterical about.

“We should not work ourselves into hysterics over such comments. In fact, all U.S. presidents in the recent past from Barack Obama to George W. Bush have used the phrase ‘all options are on the table’ in one situation or another — Iran comes to mind most recently,” said Harry J. Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for National Interest.

In March 2014, then-Secretary of State John Kerry said “all options are on the table” to hold Russia accountable for invading Ukraine, including economic sanctions and potentially military action, according to an ABC News article.

In March 2013, former President Obama said “all options were on the table” with Iran, according to a CBS News article.

More recently, In October, surrogates for President Trump and Hillary Clinton both said at a discussion that neither candidate would take options off the table when it came to North Korea.

“It does not mean war is coming tomorrow, it just means we are ready for whatever the future brings from Pyongyang, and that is not controversial at all—it’s reality,” said Kazianis.

Another North Korea expert agreed.

“All options have always been ‘on the table,&apos;” said Jennifer Lind, an associate professor at Dartmouth College.

Lind said it is also too early to tell if Trump’s policy is actually all that different from Obama’s. She said in an email to Breitbart News:

From Tillerson’s statements it appears that the Trump admin…

…thinks strategic patience has failed (Yes, all candidates say that but then they adopt this policy.)

…is keeping all options on the table (just like all previous administrations)

…wants China to do more and will push China to do more (A favorite trope by those who are out of ideas. Obama, Bush have already pushed Beijing to do more; it hasn’t and won’t. Our interests and China’s interests are not the same here.) So there we are for now. In sum, this is not as yet a departure from previous US policy. Which is good news in my mind, given the alternatives.

Indeed, Tillerson himself said U.S. policy towards North Korea has not changed, in an interview with the Independent Journal Review published Saturday. Asked whether his view that Japan and South Korea do not need to develop nuclear weapons has changed, he replied:

No, it has not, nor has the policy of the United States changed… We say all options are on the table, but we cannot predict the future. So we do think it’s important that everyone in the region has a clear understanding that circumstances could evolve to the point that for mutual deterrence reasons, we might have to consider that. But as I said yesterday, there are a lot of… there’s a lot of steps and a lot of distance between now and a time that we would have to make a decision like that. Our objective is to have the regime in North Korea come to a conclusion that the reasons that they have felt they have had to develop nuclear weapons, those reasons are not well-founded. We want to change that understanding.”

However, experts and officials say there are some subtle changes.

Tillerson said “the policy of strategic patience has ended. We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security and economic measures.”

He said those measures included fully implementing sanctions already approved by the United Nations Security Council, and bringing new states into talks on how to address North Korea.

Experts say one change was the speeding up of the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system to South Korea, which was first announced during the Obama administration.

“The Trump Administration has acted boldly in just the last few weeks in deploying the THAAD missile defense system—knowing China would be angered,” Kazianis said. “While THAAD clearly won’t save South Korea from a massive salvo of North Korean missiles, it does send a strong signal that Washington will back its ally and that the tough campaign rhetoric of 2016 was just that.”

Kazianis also recommended sending THAAD to Japan.

“The Trump administration should also send THAAD to Japan in an effort to make sure Tokyo also has all the tools it needs to stop an attack by North Korea on its own territory,” he said.

Lind said the Trump administration doesn’t have many good options, and that it’s too early to tell whether there has been any policy change.

A policy of engagement in hopes of making a deal with North Korea has been tried, with North Korea cheating.

Regime change would “almost certainly go nuclear,” she said, possibly killing millions of people, and creating devastation in North Korea and possibly Japan. There are about 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.

A limited strike option — where the U.S. and South Korea could try to take out North Korea’s weapons program — is problematic, since its facilities are deeply hidden underground, and a limited strike could escalate into a war.

“So all three options are terrible, bringing us back to what is our actual policy: understanding that North Korea is a nuclear weapons state and relying on deterrence to prevent war,” she said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae4c66f71:6f2d67:36043a10</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

This week Congressman Steve King of Iowa made the following comment on his Twitter account about the outcome of the Dutch election contest between nationalist candidate Geert Wilders and the incumbent socialist Prime Minister:

“Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.”

By the ensuing mud fight, you would think Congressman King had praised the beheading of children or “honor killings.” But, no: King had only committed a crime against “diversity” by saying American culture is different and is worth saving.

Geert Wilders’ party did not win a majority in the Dutch national parliamentary elections on March 11 – actually, no party did– but he did increase his party’s share of the popular vote by about 30%. That means his views are attracting growing support, and to applaud that trend that arouses anger among progressives –and yes, hatred—against Steve King. Wilders is a leader among Europeans seeking to halt unrestricted immigration by millions of Muslims fleeing the Middle East’s civil wars and terrorist violence.

Steve King Is watching the slow collapse of European civilization and suggesting that the United States follow a different course. Perhaps if his Republican critics bothered to examine the demographic assault on Europe they would not be so quick to condemn his Paul Revere-like warning.

Turkish President Erdogan tells Muslims in Europe to have “at least five children,” because, “You are the future of Europe.” Do you think Erdogan is planning to win the 2040 World Cup—or something more “comprehensive.” If the Muslim Brotherhood has its way, it is the future of America as well.

Congressman King was attacked mercilessly for “racist Twitter comments.” Really? “Racist”? Must every difference of opinion on important matters be reduced to a duel between white hat progressives and black hat “racists”? What is going on here?

First to attack Congressman King were the knee-jerk slander-mongers like the Southern Policy Law Center, The New York Times, and the usual gang bangers.

But the leftist watchtowers of political correctness were soon joined by mainstream media assassins, who painted a picture of a “white nationalist” politician who deserved to be pilloried as an enemy of diversity and civil rights.

After the initial attacks, Rep. King went on CNN to defend his remarks. In an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, King explained:

“[I] meant exactly what I said. You cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else’s babies. You’ve got to keep your birth rate up, and you need to teach your children your values.”

That is shocking: Congressman King believes parents should teach their children their values. Wow. Now there’s a radical idea. The globalists at CNN evidently think parents should either not teach values at all or should teach someone else’s values. Whose values? Maybe the values of the UN Human Rights Commission? Or the values spewed out bilingually by dual-citizen Jose Ramos at Univision?

But, wait: something here does not add up. King wasn’t being attacked for advocating less immigration. He was attacked for saying our nation would be better off if we reproduced our own children and our own values—which implies—oh, my, God—implies our values might be superior to imported values!

Okay, not everyone agrees with that, but how is it “racist”?

Don’t American-born babies come in all colors and all races?

Isn’t the United States the most diverse country in the world in the number of languages and races represented in our public schools and our arts and entertainment?

How is proposing that all of the millions of multi-racial Americans have more babies “racist”?

Are Catholics racist if they oppose abortion—even if more black babies are aborted in New York City than are born there?

We have entered an era of pseudo-progressivism when opposition to any progressive policy – such as unrestricted migration across open borders, or unrestricted access to public welfare benefits — is pilloried and slandered as “racist.” This new high-brow censorship is hailed as “progress,” when in reality, it is a hallmark of totalitarian repression.

Steve King did not say that only white Americans should have more babies; he wants more American babies, period. Yes, that’s an example of putting “America First,” and you can either agree or disagree with it. But to slander, it as racist is, well, plainly un-American.

Congressman King’s statements were not racist any more than people who want secure borders are “anti-immigrant.” Immigrants are people who arrive legally after a long process that takes many years. Proposing that there be no restrictions on who enters our country — and that we must take in all migrants who appear on our borders — is not a “humanitarian” policy, it is an unforgivably destructive and dangerous one.

The ongoing debate over how many and what kind of immigrants America needs should be a policy debate, not a back-alley brawl, but that is what the globalists are doing—dragging everyone into a brawl. We have seen it over and over again, this orchestrated orgy or character assassination aimed at silencing all dissent from the globalist, multicultural agenda.

If America is already the world’s “melting pot,” then the sons and daughters born inside that caldron of intercultural assimilation will necessarily represent those same races and colors. So, exactly how is it “racist” or “white nationalist” to suggest we need to pass on our values to the next generation of Americans — and not rely on young adults arriving from other cultures?

How is Steve King’s statements any different than the values expressed in President Trump’s “American First” inaugural address? Of course, they are not, and indeed, attacking King is another way of attacking President Trump’s nationalism.

Too many establishment Republicans run for the tall grass when an ounce of moral courage is needed. Republican criticism of Congressman King came quickly from some of the media’s favorite “go-to” sources when patriotic heretics are spotted on the horizon. Quick on the draw was a “Gang-of-Eight” amnesty bill supporter, Florida congresswoman Ileana Ross-Lehtinen, who went to her Twitter tool to attack King, “Get a clue…. Diversity is our strength.” Oh, but, let’s not have too much diversity in Congress. Iowa has got to go!

Other Republicans who joined the lynch mob were current House Speaker Paul Ryan. “The speaker clearly disagrees and believes America’s long history of inclusiveness is one of its great strengths,” spokesperson Ashlee Strong said.

Representative King is simply the latest victim of the merchants of globalism. His language may have been a little crude, but his point was not only valid but a necessary caution against the bitter fruit of open borders anarchy.

The attempt to sander and demonize Steve King is more than an attack on a well-known “border hawk.” The vitriol hurled at Congressman King is more intense than normal not because he is criticizing other nations or other cultures – he did not do that– but because he is praising our own culture and values—American values—and saying we must preserve those values. THAT is what is unforgivable in “post-racial America.”

Congressman King has touched a raw nerve and the progressive globalist counterattack has been visceral. To the American left, it is now racist to believe American values are worth defending, worth teaching to our children, worth preserving for future generations. Anyone who speaks out in praise of American values or suggests American values may be in danger of eclipse from massive immigration without cultural assimilation—that person and those ideas must be rejected, then marginalized, and then destroyed.

I am proud to call Congressman Steve King my friend. Americans who care about constitutional liberty and the independence of the American homeland should care equally about preserving the unique culture that undergirds those liberties and our national sovereignty. That uniquely American culture is not the one embodied in United Nations High Commission on Refugees, nor the one enforced by repression the People’s Republic of China, nor the culture enforced by religious persecution in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. And it is not the culture celebrated in Hollywood in Bill Maher’s condescending monologs.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae43cb9c7:66b9e8:36043a10</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Thanks to California artist Karen Fiorito, motorists driving on Phoenix’s Grand Avenue can see a massive billboard with nuclear mushroom cloud clown faces and dollar sign swastikas hovering over President Donald Trump.

“I think a lot of people are feeling this way and I’m just trying to express what I think is on a lot of people’s minds these days,” Fiorito told 12 News. “Something that really concerned us was this idea of a dictatorship where things were going in a certain direction.”

The controversial billboard went up Friday as part of the annual three-day Art Detour event in downtown Phoenix.

The billboard’s owner, Beatrice Moore, who also commissioned the display, said the banner imagery would remain up as long as Trump is in office.

“Some of these issues are so important you can’t not speak out,” Moore told 12 News.

Fiorito has a history of creating artwork critical of Republican presidents.

In 2004, she created a billboard with President George W. Bush and senior government officials.

“Dear America,” the billboard said, “we lied to you for your own good. Now trust us.”

Moore and Fiorito said they anticipate harsh criticism for the Trump billboard.

“I just hope that everyone involved in helping bring this message out is safe and that we all get through this unharmed,” Fiorito said.

Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox &amp; Friends,” while discussing federal courts in Hawaii and Maryland halting President Donald Trump’s new restrictions on travelers from majority-Muslim countries, Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz said if Trump’s predecessor former President Barack Obama had issued the same order, the courts would not have intervened on the constitutionality of the executive order.

“The idea of focusing so heavily on campaign rhetoric and essentially saying, look, if Obama had issued the very same order with the same words it would be constitutional, but if Trump issues it, it’s unconstitutional because he said some things about Muslims in the run-up to the campaign,” he said.

Dershowitz continued, “That’s not the way the law is supposed to operate. And finally, the Trump Justice Department is getting smart. They are appealing this not to the Ninth Circuit where they are likely to get an adverse ruling. They are appealing it to the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit is a much more conservative court. And much more likely to uphold the travel ban, and then if the case goes to the Supreme Court and ties four to four, Trump wins.”

He added, “I actually said that this wasn’t constitutional analysis. It was psychoanalysis. There is precedent in extreme cases where legislators in enacting a statute say things that you can sometimes look to the legislative intent. But I have never heard of a case where the rhetoric of a candidate, ambiguous rhetoric to be sure — because I do not believe this is a Muslim ban —focusing on a country like Iran, the greatest exporter of terrorism, not only no vetting, it sends terrorists out in order to kill Americans. Iran has so much blood on its hands of Americans and American allies, to exclude a country like Iran from the list would be absurd. And the list —although for a different purpose — was originally designed by President Obama. So how can you say that the exclusion of six countries on the list was motivated by what Mr. Trump said when he was candidate Trump? That is not good legal analysis. I’m putting my reputation on the line—I predict the case gets to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will uphold the major provisions of this ban.”

SARASOTA, Florida — Hard left-wing professional activists stormed a town hall held by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL) here on Saturday morning, but the successful businessman-turned-congressman held his own and breezed through a rowdy capacity crowd’s efforts to disrupt President Donald Trump’s agenda.

Both sides—pro-Trump activists and anti-Trump activists—showed up in force as a capacity crowd of thousands packed into the Van Wezel Performing Arts center with thousands more watching outside. Interestingly, Trump won this district in the general election by 11 percent, so the outsized show of force from leftists is not representative of the feelings of those in the district, which sprawls along Florida’s southwestern coast.

Despite the clear and concerted efforts to disrupt, Buchanan kept his cool for more than an hour throughout, made his case, and did not buckle under the left’s pressure. When one woman, who identified herself as a lifelong Democrat who has always voted for Buchanan because she likes him personally but despises Trump, remarked that the town hall must have been “as scary for you as it is for me,” he replied: “I’m enjoying it.”

“As a lifelong New Yorker, I’m 71-years-old and lived in Buffalo, New York, and I have known the gestalt and persona of Donald Trump all of my life,” the woman continued with her remarks to Buchanan. “I am asking you, this is a request not a question. From my heart to your heart, this man needs to be removed with the 25th Amendment.”

The leftists inside cheered wildly for nearly a full minute, but Buchanan did not give in.

“In my opinion, it’s not about Trump or Barack Obama—it’s about the voters that supported Trump,” Buchanan said in the pivotal moment, about 45 minutes into the town hall event, after progressive activists hammered him for almost an hour. Half the audience booed loudly, and the other half cheered shouting classic chants often heard at the president’s campaign rallies.

“He won in 31 states. So let’s give him some time to see what he can do and then we have plenty of time to weigh in and I will weigh in if necessary. I want to be helpful for the sake of our children and grandchildren. The bottom line is, he won the election,” Buchanan addded.

Most of the questions that Buchanan fielded were almost identical to those on a sheet circulated on social media by local progressive activists—and pushed by national groups as well, as part of a larger national agenda to undermine the president’s landslide electoral college victory over Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton. Many of the leftist activists at the town hall wore pink “pussy hats,” woolen knitted caps—even though it was 75 degrees outside. The “pussy hats” were a staple in the women’s marches nationwide the day after Trump’s inauguration.

One group of leftists even inaccurately accused Breitbart News of being a “Nazi, white supremacist organization” after reading a preview story on the town hall before the event started. Buchanan, when he took the stage, noted there were over 5,000 RSVPs to the town hall—which originally was going to be in a local college auditorium but changed to this venue to accommodate the larger crowd size.

The nearly 2,000 people inside, with the exception of conservatives and Trump supporters mixed throughout the crowd, regularly shouted down Buchanan’s answers to questions, screaming their dissatisfaction with the GOP congressman’s ardent support of President Trump. For nearly an hour and a half, with a couple of exceptions, Buchanan was zinged with rough question after rough question—all with the grand design of attempting to pit him against the newly elected GOP president.

Repeatedly, the progressive activists packed throughout the venue shouted nasty, politically-driven pejoratives at Buchanan. Even when he was answering questions, they would shout “answer the question” repeatedly, and yelled “yes or no” many times when he would not give them an answer they wanted. “Healthcare for all,” a sign the progressives want to go even further than Obamacare when it comes to government control of healthcare, was another chant that the activists shouted to open up the event before Buchanan even took the stage.

Most of the questions focused on the House GOP healthcare legislation that would replace Obamacare. Buchanan noted he supports changes to the bill, and is pushing for them. He said right now the process is in the “third inning” of a nine-inning game, and that the it needs to play out more.

This is the first in Breitbart News’s series of stories from Buchanan’s town hall this Saturday in Sarasota. More, including details on the exact questions leftists are pushing Republicans on and a multi-part exclusive interview with Buchanan after the town hall, is forthcoming. Videos and photos of the crowds inside and outside the arena are also forthcoming.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae3ce9a7a:5ee691:36043a10</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Part 4 of Q&amp;A.

Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) answered questions from liberal protesters gathered at a fundraiser in Los Angeles.

One question she received dealt with President Donald Trump and how they were going to get him office, to which Feinstein said he was going to “get himself out” of office.

“We have a lot of people looking at this,” Feinstein said. “I think he’s going to get himself out. I think that sending his sons to another country to make a financial deal for his company and then have that covered with government expenses — I believe government expenses should not be allowed.”

President Donald Trump released his 2018 budget proposal on Thursday revealing that the U.S. Department of State funding could be cut by 31 percent, sparking outrage among mostly Democrats, who say the cuts could put the country at risk.

Wendy Sherman, under secretary of state for political affairs in the Obama administration, told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday that Trump’s proposal to cut the State Department’s budget by a third would have “implications” for fighting terrorism and epidemics like Ebola.”

But Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) said on Thursday at the Conversations with Conservatives Press Conference on Capitol Hill that, given the agency’s priorities during the Obama administration, the cuts might fall short.

Gohmert said the cuts — first reported as 28 percent but later clarified by the State Department as totaling 31 percent — “might not be enough.”

Gohmert cited the Obama administration’s priority at State of promoting homosexual rights around the world, including encouraging nation states to change their laws regarding homosexuality and same-sex marriage.

On Jan. 11, the pro-homosexual rights publication the Washington Blade published a story entitled, “10 ways Obama promoted LGBT rights abroad.”

Those moves by the Obama administration’s State Department included:

Obama on Dec. 6, 2011, directed agencies that implement U.S. foreign policy to promote LGBT and intersex rights abroad. He issued the presidential memorandum on the same day that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered her “gay rights are human rights” speech in Geneva.

The State Department on Feb. 23, 2015, announced it had named Randy Berry as the first special U.S. envoy to promote LGBT and intersex rights abroad.

Obama in 2013 nominated six openly gay men to represent his administration overseas.

The Global Equality Fund is a public-private partnership the State Department manages with the U.S. Agency for International Development. It has contributed more than $33 million to global LGBT advocacy efforts since its 2011 inception.

A USAID rule that formally bans contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity took effect on Oct. 25, 2015.

The Obama administration in 2014 announced a series of sanctions against Uganda after the country’s president signed the Anti-Homosexuality Bill that sought to impose a life sentence upon anyone found guilty of repeated same-sex sexual acts.

Two LGBT rights activists were among the members of Cuban civil society who met with Obama in Havana on March 22, 2016.

Obama tapped three openly LGBT athletes to represent the U.S. at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Obama throughout his second-term has spoken publicly against anti-LGBT laws in Africa.

The State Department and other administration officials have urged the Malaysian government to release a leading opposition figure who is serving a 5-year prison sentence for sodomy.

Mark Toner, acting spokesman at State, clarified on Thursday the proposed percentage of cuts at State.

“There’s a little bit of confusion about that, so let me try to clarify it,” Toner said. “The FY 2018 budget requests 25.6 billion in base funding for the Department of State and USAID, and that’s a 10.1 billion or 28 percent reduction from the FY 2017 continuing resolution level.”

“So that’s a 28 percent reduction without the overseas contingency operations funding,” Toner said. “So the budget also requests, obviously, 12 billion as overseas contingency operations funding for a total request of 37.6 billion, which represents an overall reduction of 17.3 billion.”

“That’s 31 percent from the annualized – or from the CR level, which is base and OCO funds,” Toner said. “So just to simplify it, the two variations there – the 28 percent is the amount of reduction without OCO, which is the overseas contingency operations funding.”

“The 31 percent number or figure is with that overseas contingency operations funding,” Toner said.

The Los Angeles Times suggested in its reporting on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was not concerned with the budget cuts, rather than characterizing his remarks as compatible with President Trump’s assessment that the Department has been overfunded in the past.

“But the head of the department, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, seemed unconcerned Thursday,” the Times reported.

“The level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking in the past — and particularly in this past year — is simply not sustainable,” Tillerson said at a brief news conference in Tokyo, the first stop on a six-day, three-nation tour of Asia.

“Tillerson, for most of his career a top executive at Exxon Mobil, said he expected more aid from other countries would help to cover the shortfall as the U.S. recedes, and he said he was ‘confident’ the State Department would continue to fulfill its mission,” the Times reported.

“We are going to be undertaking a very comprehensive examination of how programs are executed, a very comprehensive examination of how we are structured, and I’m confident that with the input of the men and women of the State Department, we are going to construct a way forward that allows us to be much more effective, much more efficient and be able to do a lot with fewer dollars,” Tillerson said.

“We understand the challenge,” Tillerson said. “I take the challenge that the president has given us on willingly and with great expectation that with everyone in the State Department’s assistance, we’re going to deliver a much better result for the American people in the future.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae3977f9a:522577:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Saturday in an “AM Joy” discussion about Snoop Dogg’s new music video where the rapper shoots a clown version of President Donald Trump, MSNBC contributor Toure said that Trump is too much of a joke for anyone to be concerned about Snoop Dogg shooting him in a joke video.

“Now we see that there is anger at this president and he represents a lot of anger that a lot of black people have, but you can’t take him really seriously because he is a clown. He is a joke,” Toure told host Joy Reid.

“To really shoot him in a video would be like, why are you going that far? This man isn’t worthy of all that. So, of course, he makes it a joke,” he added. “There is a lot of anger about him, but he is so ridiculous that he becomes a joke.”

Hundreds of thousands of service workers are planning an anti-Trump labor strike for May 1, BuzzFeed reported Saturday.

Nearly 350,000 workers plan to strike President Trump’s agenda on International Workers’ Day on May 1.

More than 300,000 food chain workers and 40,000 unionized service workers will walk off the job that day, according to a coalition of groups leading the strike.

Multiple thousands of employees from the Service Employees International Union and United Service Workers West, led by David Huerta, will strike.

“We understand that there’s risk involved in that,” Huerta told BuzzFeed News, “but we’re willing to take that risk in order to be able to move forward in this moment, while the most marginalized are in the crosshairs of this administration.”

A statement announcing the strike says that participants will be rejecting Trump’s policies on immigration and what they say is his “agenda of hate and greed.”

“We need to show this Administration, Congress and large corporate interests that our human and economic worth is more powerful than their agenda of hate and greed,” the statement reads. “Opposing Trump is not enough. We must stop him.”

The last time there was a major strike of this magnitude was when the first Day Without Immigrants took place in 2006.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae37bf609:5962d5:36043a10</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey have passed legislation forcing all presidential candidates from the state to release their tax returns to get on the ballot, the Wall Street Journal reported this week.

The state’s legislator has approved the bill and now requires the signature of Gov. Chris Christie, who himself stood as a candidate in the 2015 Republican presidential primary before dropping out in February 2016 and endorsing President Trump.

If enacted, the bill rules that the New Jersey electoral college voters would not be allowed to cast a vote for a candidate if he or she had not disclosed his or her full tax returns.

The proposals have come about following the furor surrounding Trump’s tax returns, a portion of which was released this week, showing that he had paid $38 million in federal income taxes on a reported income of $150 million.

The tax return, dated 2005, gave him an effective tax rate of around 25 percent, well above the rates most very wealthy people paid in the same year.

This month, a letter signed by the majority of the Democratic caucus urged the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee to demand a copy of Trump’s tax returns dating back to 2007.

However, the call was rejected, with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) arguing that the priority of Congress was to “fix America’s broken tax code – not to target the tax returns of individual citizens.”

Democratic legislators in states such as New Mexico, Hawaii, Oregon, and California are pursuing similar bills to enforce the release of tax returns.

During the Saturday MSNBC “AM Joy” broadcast, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) predicted that impeachment is in President Donald Trump’s future over alleged ties with Russia.

“We are going to see who the real patriots are when we unveil this collusion that I believe is there. I think in the final analysis they are going to have to move away from [Trump] and we will see that he will be in a position where he will meet the standards and the criteria for higher crimes and misdemeanors, and I maintain that’s where impeachment comes in.

Last month, Waters said it was her “greatest desire” to lead Trump “right into impeachment.

The Trump administration’s proposed border wall is expected to be as tall as 30 feet and no shorter than 18 feet to deter potential illegal immigrants, Homeland Security officials said Friday.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has started the process of requesting bids from various companies that would include design proposals and prototypes of President Trump’s proposed barrier along the U.S.-Mexico border, the Washington Times reported.

The agency has released two proposals for contractors who want to submit a bid: a solid, concrete wall and a wall with “a see-through component/capability.”

“The wall design shall be physically imposing in height,” CBP officials said in contracting documents.

The agency said the goal is to have a 30-foot wall, but it will accept proposals as low as 18 feet.

They also said the wall must be at least six feet underground to prevent anyone from tunneling underneath it and high enough that no one can climb the wall without a ladder, NPR reports.

It should take at least an hour, and ideally more than four hours, to make a hole in the wall so agents can stop anyone attempting to break it down.

The government outlines that the wall must be able to withstand a “sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools.”

In the documents, CBP says that the side facing the U.S. must also be “aesthetically pleasing” in “color, anti-climb texture etc., to be consistent with general surrounding environment.” There was no mention of how the Mexican side should look.

About 700 companies have registered as potential vendors for the project since CBP first began weighing interest this month.

Contractors have until March 29 to submit their proposals for the first phase of the project.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae32953cb:5369bd:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A Trump administration spokesman says an individual was apprehended near the White House, a week after an intruder was caught on White House grounds.

Press secretary Sean Spicer wrote on Twitter on Saturday that the individual “jumped bike rack on Pennsylvania Ave” but did not make it onto White House property.

Spicer added, “Great response by @SecretService.”

President Donald Trump was not at the White House on Saturday. He and his family are spending the weekend at his Palm Beach, Florida, resort.

The Secret Service did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The incident comes about a week after a man breached a 5-foot outer perimeter fence and scaled an 8-foot vehicle gate to gain entry to the White House grounds.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae2bafef9:4bc5a6:36043a10</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” CNN anchor Jake Tapper stated that there are “fair critiques of the media when it comes to, especially, running a lot of the Trump rallies early on, start to finish, no editorial comment,” something every cable news network did.

Tapper said, “I think that there’s certainly…fair critiques of the media when it comes to, especially, running a lot of the Trump rallies early on, start to finish, no editorial comment, just like, what is this? What are we doing here? And CNN did that. Fox did it. MSNBC did it. And my boss, Jeff Zucker, has acknowledged that we did that too much, early on. I think that some of the toughest interviews that were done of President Trump, and Hillary Clinton for that matter, were on CNN.”

WASHINGTON – As many as 1,000 more U.S. forces could deploy to Syria to help local forces retake Raqqa, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria’s de facto capital in Syria, according to a recent report.

The U.S. military has drawn up early plans that would deploy up to 1,000 more troops to northern Syria in the coming weeks, U.S. defense officials recently told the Washington Post.

U.S. Central Command to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would have to approve the program before it heads to President Donald Trump for approval.

The increase of troops would be three-fold. The Obama administration had authorized 503 U.S. forces to be deployed full-time to Syria.

The new troops would focus on advising Kurdish and Arab fighters in northern Syria fighting ISIS, training them in skills like bomb disposal and coordinating air support.

The troop increase comes as the Trump administration is looking into how to accelerate the fight against ISIS.

The President tasked the Pentagon with coming up with a plan within 30 days, and Mattis submitted a “broad outline” at the end of February, and Centcom Commander Gen. Joe Votel has been “filling in more details,” according to the Post.

That plan is due by the end of the month to Mattis, who is likely to sign off on them, a defense official told the Post.

However, much of the plan will depend on how many troops U.S. partners in the region may send.

Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman said Thursday before a meeting at the Pentagon with Mattis that he would consider sending troops.

“We are ready to do anything that will eradicate terrorism, anything without limits,” he responded to a reporter’s question.

The potential troop increase also comes as the Pentagon is deliberating whether to scrap the distinction between troops who deploy on a full-time basis and short-term.

Those on a full-time deployment count as part of what is called a “Force Management Level.” According to the FML, there are 503 troops in Syria and more than 5,000 in Iraq.

In Syria, at least several hundreds more have deployed there on a short-term basis, not counted as part of the 503 – including about 250 Army Rangers and 200 Marines.

The Marines arrived recently to provide artillery support as the local Syrian forces fight to retake Raqqa.

The Rangers are in a northern Syrian town called Manbij, where they are making sure fighting does not break out between various parties that may seek to claim the area, which was freed from ISIS last August.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae283df43:3fa2da:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated that President Trump violates the “Pay your taxes” rule and “I worry that if half the country wants this guy to be president, we do need the UN to step in, or the United Federation of Planets, or something.”

Maher said Trump “violates every rule. Don’t lie. Don’t accuse people of things they’re not guilty of. Don’t boast. Pay your taxes. Serve your country. Don’t be a racist, don’t insult…the handicapped people, and other people who are not as lucky to be as great-looking as you are, Donald.

Trump called on Americans to unite and find the “soul of Rosie and the spirit of Jackson.”

Transcript as follows:

This week, I traveled to Nashville, Tennessee to lay a wreath at the grave of Andrew Jackson, on the 250thanniversary of his birth. Jackson was an American hero. First, as the brilliant general whose crushing defeat of the British at New Orleans saved our independence in the War of 1812. And later, as the seventh President of the United States — when he fought to defend the forgotten men and women from the arrogant elite of his day. Does it sound familiar?

The memory of his leadership lives on in our people, and his spirit points us to a better future.

This week, I also traveled to the Willow Run plant in Michigan. At that facility during the Second World War, the Ford Motor Company built not cars, but entire airplanes. At one point, workers there produced a complete B-24 Liberator every single hour — hard to believe.

Today on that site is a new facility, where the cutting edge cars of the future will be tested. And this week, the old plant was filled once again with thousands of workers and engineers. I was there to share the good news for the American auto industry.

We announced we’ll be reversing an 11thhour executive action from the previous Administration that was threatening thousands of auto jobs in Michigan and across America. And I mean threatening — it was very, very sad to see.

In fact, we are setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify any unnecessary regulation that is hurting American businesses and American jobs.

The first two job reports of my administration show that we’ve already added nearly half a million new jobs.

The days of economic surrender for the United States are over. For too long, special interests have made money shipping jobs overseas. We need a new economic model – let’s call it the American Model. Under this model, we will lower the burden on American Business but, in exchange, they must hire and grow America and American jobs. This will be a win-win for our companies and for our workers.

Let’s buy American and hire American. Let’s create jobs in America. Let’s imagine new industries. And let’s build a beautiful future together.

Among the workers building B-24 bombers at the Willow Run plant during World War II was one tough lady. You might have heard of her: they called her Rosie the Riveter. And when Rosie’s country called her, she answered the call.

Rosie was famous for her toughness and her strength — and for the words that were emblazoned above her famous image. It said very simply: “We can do it.”

If Americans unite and find again within our nation the soul of Rosie and the spirit of Jackson—I have no doubt that we can do it, and do it like never before.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ae215a1c7:380ff2:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In the first joint press conference between U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the German leader claimed that a trade deal between the U.S. and the EU would be like a trade deal between two countries.

Trade was the topic of much of the press conference between the two leaders as President Trump has made the subject one of the pillars of his administration. During the press questions, a reporter from German paper Die Welt asked Ms Merkel if she thought that a trade agreement between the EU and the U.S. would be multilateral or bilateral.

Merkel said and agreement like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would be bilateral, indicating that she viewed the European Union as its own country, rather than a federation of countries.

“I believe that the president has clearly set out his philosophy as to what trade agreements have to bring about for the American side as well. I personally don’t think that Germany needs to negotiate and not the European Union.

“We’ve devolved our competences to the European Union, so the European Union, or rather the commission, negotiates on behalf of the member states,” Merkel said outlining that it is the unelected commission of the EU, whose role it is to be at the table for trade deals.

“So that’s not going to prevent us from concluding agreements and indeed this would then qualify as a bilateral agreement between the EU and the United States if we had it,” she added.

“The question is will it benefit both countries or not?” she said.

President Trump has made it clear that he supports bilateral trade deals over multilateral deals that can often involve a dozen or more countries with different values and different economic interests. One of the president’s first acts after assuming office was to scrap TTIP which, unlike Merkel, he did not believe was bilateral.

The view of Angela Merkel, that of pro-globalisation and of a centralised European Union, is being heavily challenged by countries like Hungary who wish to see reform in the union and more emphasis on the individual countries, than the central EU bureaucracy.

In April France will start the process of electing a new president and anti-mass migration candidate Marine Le Pen has already hit out at Merkel’s philosophy saying that she, like Trump, wants to put her country first and end the experiment of centralised supranational organisations like the EU. A win for Le Pen would likely strike a huge blow for Merkel and her philosophy.

[WARNING: Adult language]

Friday on “CNN Tonight,” network host Fareed Zakaria said President Donald Trump has succeeded by “bullshitting.”

Zakaria said, “I think the president is somewhat indifferent to things that are true or false. He has spent his whole life bullshitting. He has succeeded by bullshitting. He has gotten the presidency by bullshitting. It’s very hard to tell somebody at that point that bullshit doesn’t work because look at results. Right? But that’s what he does. He sees something he doesn’t particularly care if it’s true or not. Just puts it out there and then he puts something else out. Notice again at the press conference, when pushed on it, does take responsibility. ‘I wasn’t saying that just quoting somebody else.’ When you have the White House press secretary quote somebody to prove a point, you’re endorsing that view.”

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio might easily win a second term, all thanks to the state and federal prosecutors clearing two separate year-long probes into his campaign fundraising practices.

Addressing the decision Thursday afternoon in City Hall, de Blasio repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, deflecting reporters’ questions by responding “the issue has been exhaustively investigated” and told reporters this would be the final time he would discuss this matter.

“It simply confirms what I’ve said all along and I was obviously pleased to see the issue closed,” de Blasio said in a combative news conference with reporters. “My staff, my colleagues and I have acted in a manner that was legal and appropriate and ethical throughout. What matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year and no charges have been brought and this is the end of the matter.”

De Blasio has been the subject of multiple federal and state investigations since taking office in 2014. Federal investigations centered around the mayor’s pay-to-play scheme with donors who contributed to his 2013 mayoral election campaign, while the state focused on de Blasio’s fundraising operation of his unsuccessful efforts to help Democrats regain control of the State Senate in 2014, along with his 2013 now-defunct nonprofit campaign ‘Campaign for One New York.’

The surprise Thursday morning announcement from both federal and state prosecutors, issued just minutes apart, announced that neither would bring any criminal charges against the mayor or his aides.

In a statement released Thursday morning, acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim, said a “thorough investigation” was conducted regarding the mayor soliciting donations from those who sought political favors and found “difficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit.”

The Manhattan District Attorney’s office announced its decision in a 10-page letter to the state Board of Election. The critical and detailed letter of the “extensive investigation” resulted in the conclusion not to bring charges since the mayor and his aides relied “on the advice of counsel.” However, Vance emphasized the lack of an indictment didn’t constitute “an endorsement of the conduct at issue.”

When questioned about Vance assessment that criticized his action, de Blasio said he doesn’t “share their assessment.”

“They have an assessment, I don’t share their assessment,” de Blasio responded. “They had to make a judgment on whether anything inappropriate happened and their judgment was it did not.”

The move to conclude de Blasio parallel criminal probes came just days after Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, was fired by President Trump. Bharara led the year-long investigation into the mayor fundraising after a lead investigator at the state Board of Elections asked prosecutors to investigate whether de Blasio broke the law by funneling campaign contributions to Democratic state Senate candidates through state committee groups to evade donation contribution limits.

Just last month, de Blasio met with Bharara voluntary for four hours regarding the probe. The meeting was considered to be the final step in determining whether or not charges would be brought.

Since the meeting with Bharara, de Blasio repeatedly refused to go into detail about what was discussed due to the matter being an active investigation. Now with the investigation closed, half the questions the mayor faced during Thursday press conference were about disclosing the details of the interview.

“What matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year and no charges have been brought and this is the end of the matter,” de Blasio responded.

De Blasio refused to comment on whether it was a coincidence that Bharara was fired just days before the investigation was dropped and his personal feelings towards the former U.S. attorney.

“Again, I am not going to comment on [Bharara] at this moment,” de Blasio said. “Personally, I appreciate him and his office conducting a diligent investigation and made the determination on a timely basis.”

Regarding his pay-to-play scheme of donors calling him for a favor, de Blasio defended the issue, arguing that it is “normal” for him to receive concerns from any individual and approach the city agencies to “assess the situation.”

If anyone brings an issue to me, an elected official, community leader, a business person, an individual, we pass that to an agency to assess the situation to come up with a determination,” de Blasio said. “I think it is normal for an elected official to receive concerns from people and pass them along for an agency to assess. That’s how we have done things, that’s how we will continue to do things.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15adfd2fb6d:109470:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton talked on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily about the various hacking and wiretapping allegations to emerge from the 2016 presidential campaign.

Fitton agreed with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow’s contention that Trump “changed the debate” when he alleged surveillance resources were improperly used against him by the Obama administration.

“Many of us have been concerned not so much about the ‘unicorn theory’ of the election that the Left has been running, but about the fact that there was surveillance done of the Trump team, and then that surveillance – which was classified in part – was illegally leaked in an effort to destroy them,” Fitton said.

“If suspicions are correct that it was Obama administration officials, former officials who leaked that information, then those individuals could go to jail,” he noted. “That’s how serious the leaks were.”

“By President Trump’s highlighting the fact that he was surveilled, allegedly personally – whether he’s right in the specifics or not, I don’t know, but I think he’s right generally in the sense that he was targeted with some type of surveillance, he and his team. Whether the surveillance was for other reasons and his team were picked up incidentally or not, that’s to be found out. But we do know that surveillance was misused, and in my view, if it was misused, maybe it was done for improper purposes, as well,” he said.

Marlow noted that while mainstream media coverage strongly suggested an intensive investigation of Trump’s campaign was in progress throughout the 2016 election, with plenty of surveillance, officials and congressional committees are now saying no “wiretapping” was conducted. “Who’s right on this thing?” he asked.

“I don’t even know what ‘wiretapping’ means,” Fitton replied, comparing loose use of the term with former President Bill Clinton’s notorious argument about the precise meaning of the word “is.”

“Was there surveillance? Was there intelligence being gathered, and did it pick up either the Trump organization in terms of their internal communications or external communications, or his associates, either on the campaign or people close to him? That’s what the media had been telling us for months and months and months,” he pointed out.

“And now, the media wants to have their cake and eat it too, in the sense that once Trump said, ‘Hey, why was I being surveilled here?’ they said, ‘Oh, no, you weren’t being surveilled.’ Well, they had been reporting that people around him had been surveilled for months, and it, therefore, suggested collusion between the Trump people and Russia on the campaign. And now, we’re told, well, that’s not necessarily the case,” he said.

“That’s why we’ve got, frankly, independent FOIAs and two lawsuits designed to figure out what was going on directly,” Fitton said of Judicial Watch’s perspective on the controversy. “I don’t trust Congress to get at it directly because I think the intelligence committees, generally speaking, aren’t going to really hold the intelligence agencies to account in any significant way. That’s why you need an independent third party like Judicial Watch asking these questions.”

Marlow turned to a flurry of recent court decisions by activist judges, including a block on President Trump’s executive order to suspend visas for six security-risk nations and even a possible judicial order to double the number of refugees accepted into the United States. He noted Fitton has warned about a “judicial war” against Trump.

“I think some judges are letting their concerns about Donald Trump get in the way of their judicial decision-making,” Fitton said. “A lot of these decisions seem more anti-Trump than a traditional judicial decision that carefully applies the law. The analysis, for instance, in the Hawaii court about Trump’s concern about Islamic terrorism – it’s just one judge substituting his political judgment and policy disagreements with President Trump and mistaking that for the real law.”

“This is something that judges aren’t supposed to do,” he noted. “You had five judges in the Ninth Circuit essentially call out their fellow colleagues on this, saying, ‘We’ve got to be careful here. We can’t let our policy disagreements or our concerns one way or another for President Trump color our decision-making.’ That’s pretty extraordinary to say.”

“There’s this Deep State approach in the administration, the executive agencies, and the bureaucracies. That way of thinking is infecting too many judicial decisions related to the president’s executive orders,” he charged.

Marlow said the Deep State has been much-discussed on Breitbart News Daily in recent days. He asked Fitton for his conception of the Deep State and how much of a threat it poses to President Trump’s agenda.

“It’s the permanent bureaucracy. It’s the recent hires of President Obama, obviously. But we should recognize that individuals who are in government for 10, 20, 30 years aren’t in government because they’re tea partiers. They’re there because they like the idea of the government, generally speaking, any more than someone’s working at McDonald’s for 30 years because they hate McDonald’s,” Fitton replied.

He said these lifetime bureaucrats “tend to have contempt for political appointees,” especially Republican political appointees.

“With Trump, there’s a particular animus because they don’t think Trump deserves to be president, and so they’re going to fight him, and organize against him, and quote ‘resist’ him.”

“You see it in this unholy alliance in the Hawaiian decision, where you have the DHS, you may recall, issues some sort of sketchy staff report undermining the president’s executive orders by suggesting we don’t have to worry about terrorism from these foreign countries that he’s concerned about, these six or seven countries. It wasn’t a final product. It wasn’t approved by anyone; they just leaked it, and that report is being cited by the District Court judge in Hawaii as a reason to suggest Mr. Trump’s order was not valid. Isn’t that convenient?” Fitton said sarcastically.

He said Judicial Watch was still working to resolve pending lawsuits for documents related to Hillary Clinton’s email server and various Obama administration controversies.

“We had about 60 pending against the Obama administration on Inauguration Day, and when the president raised his hand, President Trump raised his hand and took the oath, they became against the Trump administration,” Fitton said.

“We’re still waiting for the Trump administration to come to power in many respects because currently on FOIA, nothing’s changed. They’re defending the Clinton emails as if Obama was running the show – a further example of the alt-government in place,” he said.

In addition to those long-pending suits, Fitton said Judicial Watch is trying to monitor “lawlessness in the bureaucracies” and challenge bureaucratic mischief related to immigration, such as San Francisco’s “sanctuary city” policy and “the University of California’s illicit in-state tuition policy for illegal aliens.”

“On top of that, we’ve got the election fraud crisis, the voter fraud crisis that the president aptly highlighted. Those battles continue in states across the nation,” he said.

“The crisis caused by the Left’s attack on the rule of law has not abated in significant ways, and it frankly continues,” Fitton declared.

SARASOTA, Florida — Thousands of professional progressive protesters are plotting to disrupt a town hall event for Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL) here on Saturday morning, Breitbart News has learned, as part of a grander effort to grind down President Donald Trump and his America First agenda on the national stage.

Anti-Trump progressive organizers in the area are flooding social media with messages detailing their plans for disruption and even expressing the hope that President Trump dies soon. They openly state their goal is to halt the mandate the president has from his landslide electoral college win on Nov. 8, when he crushed Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton by winning 30-and-a-half states — cruising to a 306 vote electoral college victory.

The vitriolic nature of the progressive left’s desperate anti-Trump streak shines through in organizing messages in local Facebook posts, including one in which progressive activists say their “favorite” interaction with someone recently was a man who rolled down the window of his car while they were protesting and said he wished that President Trump was dead.

The local progressive Facebook group Indivisible Bradenton Pro-gressive wrote:

Our street protests were lively again, and we practiced our sign-waving skills with a lot of razzmatazz this week. Our signs reflected our concerns: ‘Did Trump Collude With Russia?’ ‘Trumpcare is Worse Than Obamacare,’ ‘GOP Bad Health Bill; 24,000,000 LOSE; Rich Get Tax Break,’ ’24 Million Will Lose Coverage Under Republican Plan,’ ‘Protect Our Care! Save the ACA,’ and ‘Sessions Must Resign.’ Our smaller group seemed to embolden the hecklers this week. We got several long profanity-laced tirades directed at us from both passing cars and people on the street. We just thanked them loudly or whooped in response for our own cheers. We’re enough of a regular fixture now on Tuesdays mornings that one woman who works in a nearby office asked if we are here because we are only allowed to protest on Tuesdays (?!). That made me realize all the more the importance of making our presence known and what people’s democratic rights truly allow them in this sleepy town. We of course got a lot of cheers and honks, as we always do, along with some thank yous. The favorite this week was an older gentleman who rolled down his window, spoke very slowly, and said: ‘We all need to pray very hard that Trump goes to heaven very soon.’

In other words, one of the “favorite” comments these progressive organizers heard all week was a man wishing that President Trump was dead and “goes to heaven very soon.” The original Facebook posting has since been removed and reposted with slightly different wording, where instead of the original description of that exchange with the man who wished President Trump was dead as the progressive organizer and post author’s “favorite” of the week, it was altered to say the exchange with that man was the “most notable oddity” of the week. Breitbart News has screenshots of the original, however, and is providing both the original post and the revised one here.

Both the original and revised postings also included details about the left-wing activists’ efforts to storm Buchanan’s town hall on Saturday, noting that a Buchanan staffer “received us kindly as always” when asked for details about the congressman’s upcoming town hall event.

“First, we sought more information about the format of Saturday’s town hall meeting,” the progressive group said in both posts. “She said that much of the time and format of the meeting was still being decided. So we don’t have anything new to report on that front.”

More than 4,000 people have RSVP’d for Buchanan’s Sarasota town hall on Saturday morning, Buchanan’s office and local Republicans tell Breitbart News, and they are expecting an onslaught of progressives who are not representative of the district’s electorate as a whole to attempt to dominate the discussion. If the RSVP numbers hold firm—or even come close to matching that whopping total—this town hall will be the biggest nationwide as of yet in a series of recent unruly town halls Republican members of Congress have faced since President Trump’s inauguration, and it has the potential to set the tone for whether the president will succeed in legislatively achieving his agenda moving forward.

Several deep ties between Sarasota’s political story and Trump’s national rise make this one of the most interesting events early in Trump’s administration. This particular congressman, Buchanan, has a personal story that’s eerily similar to President Trump’s rise to power: both were highly successful businessmen before running for office. What’s more, this district in many ways serves as a bellwether not just for Florida but perhaps for the nation as a whole. To top it off, the venue for the town hall—the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall here in Sarasota—is hallowed ground for President Trump.

Just weeks before Trump announced his presidential campaign, the Sarasota GOP awarded him its annual Statesman of the Year award in May 2015 in front of a sold-out crowd in the same hall. That award was bestowed upon Trump by Sarasota-area GOP powerbroker Joe Gruters, now a Florida statehouse representative. Gruters was vice chairman of the Florida GOP, and joined the Trump campaign early as a senior official. That made him the highest ranking Republican Party official in the state to back any candidate in the GOP primaries, drawing ire from allies of Trump opponents and state power players Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and former Gov. Jeb Bush.

“What you have here is Vern Buchanan and Donald Trump are very similar in that they’re business guys who want to get deals done,” Christian Ziegler — a state committeeman who also served as a delegate for Trump to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio last July and as a presidential elector for President Trump in the electoral college — told Breitbart News in a Friday afternoon interview. Ziegler said:

They know how to negotiate. They sit around a table and want to accomplish stuff. They really don’t understand why there’s gridlock in Washington—it makes no sense to them, because they’re used to their businesses, being the CEO and just executing. That’s why they’ve been successful, they’ve both made a lot of money, they’ve hired a lot of people—both of them—and they know how to manage, they know how to pick good executives, which is really important in government especially being president because he’s got to pick all the agency heads and all that stuff. They really know how to negotiate, that’s really all Washington is—one big negotiation on Capitol Hill—so I think that’s a big strength both of them share. And I think they’re both frustrated that nothing can get done in Washington and we’re not looking after the consumer, the voter. So I think they kind of both share that too. I think it’s interesting because I’ve gotten to know Vern and the governor, Rick Scott—we have a governor too, which is great, that’s what we need. We need more business guys to get in. Actually, I’ve never thought of it—our congressman, our governor and our president are all successful business people. At least for Sarasota County, we can claim all our people here are not career politicians and all three of them, their first political office is what they’re in now.

Sarasota offers national politicians, especially Republicans, access to a network of centrally located donors with deep pockets. But it also has the potential for big crowds, as Trump saw in his many trips to the area during the primaries and general election.

Before launching his own political career, Ziegler served for six years as a senior staffer to Buchanan. He made a nearly successful bid for the Florida GOP chairmanship against current chair and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) ally Blaise Ingoglia this year, coming up just short of toppling the establishment on his own. His wife serves on the local school board, something Ziegler noted offers him a unique window into understanding how the left operates from a local level — and how that professionally organized approach from progressive activists seeps from the ground level up to state and eventually all the way to national politics in an interconnected fashion. His wife, he said, regularly faces down progressive protesters targeting her on matters relevant to the national cultural debate, like transgender bathroom policies. Ziegler said:

When they come out to protest the school board, they have all these printed signs and all these groups that are bussing people in. But I think the same thing is happening with Trump. You look at all these different organizations. There’s people from outside the district—people from downtown Tampa that have no connection to our district, that are organizing all these counter protests around the state. They’re doing a fairly good job for their cause, but it’s definitely an organized, paid, apparatus if you will and effort. So I think we’ll see that tomorrow as well.

The orchestration from the hard left is nearly identical and linked together at every level, he added. He went on to say:

That is occurring and we’re seeing that on the ground in Florida statewide—my colleagues in the Republican Party of Florida as well, they’re reporting the same thing as well. It’s happening all around the state, especially over on the east coast. People who have never really gotten involved or have never been able to turn out a crowd, all of a sudden busses are coming in and people are showing up outside of Mar-a-Lago pretty upset. So, it’s an opportunity for the left to generate support whatever you think of Trump but I don’t think it’s truly representative of the average Floridian if you will. I think it is an orchestrated effort by professional protesters and professional activists. You look at something like the women’s march—that was something that was organized by these groups and then they just blend because they say ‘let’s march for women, let’s march against Trump.’

For now, it does not appear the left is making headway — at least not here in Sarasota or specifically with Buchanan. In a statement, Buchanan told Breitbart News he plans to work with President Trump to accomplish the things both of them campaigned on.

“I promised my constituents I would work to repeal Obamacare, reduce federal spending and protect Americans against terrorists,” Buchanan said. “I’m looking forward to working with President Trump’s administration to accomplish these important goals and shake up Washington’s broken political system.”

What the leftists plan to do here on Saturday is very clearly stated in literature progressive organizers have been distributing on social media: Grind down President Trump in any way possible, by any means necessary. They want to force Buchanan to take positions and answer questions he may not want to, and put him in a tough spot by pitting him against the president.

A document that the same aforementioned Facebook group has been circulating openly online clearly states the group’s agenda at this town hall:

The document reads:

The overall strategy at these Town Hall meetings is to use them as a media opportunity for our side. So the goal is to ask questions, and elicit responses from Congressman Buchanan, that will push him to take stances closer to what we would prefer, to demonstrate how Buchanan is ‘out of touch’ with his district when he stands with Trump’s agenda, and to show how Republican policies are hurting everyday Americans. Although things like the AHCA can potentially hurt millions, statistics can be hard to comprehend and sometimes make people’s eyes glaze over. But stories of individuals really bring things home and dramatize issues in powerful ways. So the most effective thing you can do is tailor any of the following questions with a short personal story about how proposed or enacted legislation negatively affects yourself, family, or friends. But don’t force it, either — a simple, straightforward question that is easy to understand is absolutely terrific, too.

The document then proceeds to detail a number of suggested questions designed to put Buchanan on the defensive, and to pit him against the Trump administration. They range from inquiries on matters like the House GOP Obamacare replacement plan, to the Russia hacking story, to Trump’s taxes, to the border wall, to the president’s recent executive orders on immigration suspending travel from a variety of countries, and more. The five-page document literally writes out the wording of dozens of suggested questions for those who would attend Buchanan’s town hall, and links to the national organization “Indivisible” which is helping organize the efforts to resist Trump’s mandate and agenda across the country.

The efforts to target Buchanan professionally — and this certainly seems like a professional political hit, not grassroots bottom-up organization by concerned constituents — do not appear to be an accident. Sarasota has always been a battleground county in Florida, though it shades to the Republicans slightly. Florida is a battleground state with 29 electoral votes and was crucial to Trump’s win in both the primaries and the general election. Most importantly, though, is that Trump far outperformed recent GOP presidential candidates in the Sarasota area — something Ziegler suggests may be a sign the left is worried they are losing ground here for the future and are desperate to regain lost territory. In 2008, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) — then the GOP nominee — won Sarasota county over now-former President Barack Obama, but only by 237 votes. In 2012, then- GOP nominee Mitt Romney beat Obama by more than 15,000 votes here, but that still was not enough to win the state of Florida. Trump beat Clinton here by more than 26,000 votes, a much more substantial margin — something that helped him win statewide. Ziegler says that vote math has Democrats “scrambling” to regain relevancy. Ziegler said:

He [Trump] made a big statement and it’s not only [Sarasota County], it’s Florida as a whole. If you put yourself in the Democrats’ shoes, right, for the whole election they were told that Hillary is winning and this is her election to lose, right? There’s no way she’s losing it. Really, I think Democrats were really complacent and they just expected victory. What happened was was on election night you had Donald Trump and just like Florida that we’re in now right, he won these states that he wasn’t supposed to win and that he wasn’t expected to win and there’s no chance. The media said that, the left said that to their own allies. If you’re a Democrat, on election day you’re looking at the map and you see Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and you’re like ‘oh crap, what just happened to us?’ Now they’re fighting for relevance. So it’s almost like their last stand when you look at the Democratic Party. And they lose that historic election that they were expected to win, and I think now they’re scrambling. When you’re desperate, you scramble and you try every tactic you can and it energizes you. You throw Hail Mary’s, but it’s too bad so sad it’s a couple months late. But that’s what you’re seeing now. All that activity is being fueled by them being totally desperate and paranoid and freaking out that they could lose their relevance altogether.

Ziegler and other local Republicans are doing everything they can to get Trump voters to show up and back up the president and their GOP congressman — even running ads on social media promoting the town hall and blasting out invitations to email lists of Trump backers. And Trump’s silent majority army may just show up to support the president’s agenda in the face of the left — or they might not, as they have been active in other recent events, and Ziegler notes that the voters from the party that just won the election tend not to be as concerned as those who lost. But here in Sarasota on Saturday morning, it appears the first major outside-the-beltway battle over the Trump agenda will play itself out. If the right holds the line, and rallies around the president, the left may become further disillusioned. But if the left draws blood, expect more of this nationwide.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15adfb777f7:f1890:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Department of Justice is formally objecting to the March 15 claim by a District Court judge in Maryland that President Donald Trump’s violated the religious freedom clauses of the constitution with his March 6 Executive Order on immigration reform.

The objection goes to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, whose 15-judge panel includes ten judges nominated by Democratic presidents and only five nominated by GOP presidents. It will likely be sent to the Supreme Court later this year.

“President Trump’s Muslim ban has fared miserably in the courts, and for good reason — it violates fundamental provisions of our Constitution,” said a response from the plaintiff’s lawyer, Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “We look forward to defending this careful and well-reasoned decision in the appeals court.”

The Maryland decision targeted Trump’s March 6 E.O. 13780, titled “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States.”

Much of the judge’s 43-page decision is a complaint about the President’s political statements and promised policies, for which he was elected to implement. The judge declares:

[Plaintiff] John Doe No. 1 has stated that the travel ban has “created significant fear, anxiety, and insecurity” for him and his wife and that the “anti-Muslim views” underlying the Executive Orders have caused him “significant stress and anxiety” to the point that he “worr(ies] that I may not be safe in this country.” … John Doe NO.3 has stated that the “anti-Muslim attitudes that are driving” the Executive Orders cause him “stress and anxiety” and lead him to “question whether I even belong in this country.”

The judge developed his claim that Trump’s policy is an illicit restraint on the religious freedom of Muslims in the United States to get visas for their foreign co-religionists.

“Plaintiffs, comprised of six individuals and three organizations, assert that they will be harmed by the implementation of the Second Executive Order. Collectively, they assert that because the Individual Plaintiffs are Muslim and the Organizational Plaintiffs serve or represent Muslim clients or members, the anti-Muslim animus underlying the Second Executive Order inflicts stigmatizing injuries on them all. The Individual Plaintiffs, who each have one or more relatives who are nationals of one of the Designated Countries and are currently in the process of seeking permission to enter the United States, also claim that if the Second Executive Order is allowed to go into effect, their separation from their loved ones, many of whom live in dangerous conditions, will be unnecessarily prolonged …

The judge cited Trump’s campaign promise, plus cited leaks from the Department of Homeland Security, and claims from officials who were in former President Barack Obama’s administration, to justify his claim that:

In this highly unique case, the record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban… even if the Second Executive Order has a national security purpose, it is likely that its primary purpose remains the effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban. Accordingly, there is a likelihood that the travel ban violates the Establishment Clause.

The judge also revealed his proposal to reverse Trump’s reduction of refugee inflow, via a footnote in his March 15 decision where he denounced Trump’s reformist Executive Orders.

Trump’s E.O. cited Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, which gives the President near-complete power over who gets into the United States, according to a January 2017 report by Congress’ Congressional Research Service. The critical language declares, at 8 U.S.C. § 1182 (f) that:

Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate

Federal law also allows the president to exclude national-security threats, including communists and people who wish to overthrow the U.S. Constitution. For example, 212(f) section of the law says the president and his deputies can exclude:

-Any alien who a consular officer or the Attorney General knows, or has reasonable ground to believe, seeks to enter the United States to engage solely, principally, or incidentally in- (i) any activity (1) to violate any law of the United States relating to espionage or sabotage or (II) to violate or evade any law prohibiting the export from the United States of goods, technology, or sensitive information, (ii)any other unlawful activity, or (iii) any activity a purpose of which is the opposition to, or the control or overthrow of, the Government of the United States by force, violence, or other unlawful means, is inadmissible.

The blueprint for the Trump administration’s FY 2018 budget released on Thursday “allows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster, and refugee program funding” in the State Department.

“This would focus funding on the highest priority areas while asking the rest of the world to pay their fair share,” the blueprint states.

“Taken together with the executive order, it looks like the president will keep the refugee program with a lower annual number, like the 50,000 limit specified in Executive Order 13780, and when the annual determination is released, identify countries of concern in a way that excludes Somalia, and other countries of concern that are known to harbor terrorists,” a source familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News.

“As long as he keeps the refugee program going, we are going to get more people from countries related to real security issues and regardless, the program needs to be legislatively reformed and regulations that have caused Constitutional violations repealed before restarting in FY 2018,” the source adds.

The language of the blueprint, however, could be interpreted to suggest that the Trump administration’s “significant funding of . . . [the] refugee program” defines the program broadly to include safe zones in other parts of the world in addition to the federal refugee resettlement program. As such, a further reduction of refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2018 could be entirely possible.

President Trump supported the establishment of safe zones for refugees during the campaign.

Typically, the president releases an annual determination of the number of refugees to be allowed into the country in the month preceding the start of a new fiscal year, which begins on October 1.

Under the Refugee Act of 1980, that number is determined at the sole discretion of the president.

Subsequent to the president’s determination of that number, Congress has traditionally funded the refugee resettlement program at the level set by the president for the coming fiscal year.

FY 2017 has proceeded differently.

In September, President Obama announced a determination that he wanted Congress to fund the arrival of 110,000 refugees in the United States in FY 2017, an increase from 84,995 that arrived in FY 2016. Congress, caught up in an election year in which the number of refugees to be resettled, as well as their vetting and countries of origin, were key issues in the Presidential campaign, did not pass a budget for the full fiscal year prior to the beginning of FY 2017.

Instead, Congress passed a temporary continuing resolution that extended the FY 2016 budget through the first ten weeks of FY 2017, then renewed an additional continuing resolution in December that runs out at the end of April.

That budget funds refugee resettlement at the FY 2016 level of 84,995 annually for a little more than a month more. Come April 28, there will be no budget authority for any discretionary budget activities–including refugee resettlement–unless Congress passes funding authority for the balance of FY 2017.

Given the contentious current political environment of Washington, it is uncertain whether Congress will have such funding authority in place prior to that date.

During the three months and 20 days of FY 2017, the final days of the Obama administration, 30,122 refugees were resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 83,292.

In the subsequent 55 days since the start of the Trump administration, 7,989 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 53,018.

To date, 38,111 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which would leave room for a maximum of 11,899 over the remaining six months and fourteen days of FY 2017, under President Trump’s 50,000 level set in Executive Order 13769 signed on January 27, then set again in Executive Order 13780 signed on March 6.

On Wednesday, 9th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Derrick Watson, an Obama appointee and 1991 Harvard Law School classmate of the former president, struck down Executive Order 13780 hours before it was scheduled for implementation. He based his 43-page decision, issued just two hours after the hearing was concluded, on campaign statements made by President Trump prior to his election and a leaked “draft document” from the office of a Department of Homeland Security Obama holdover whom Breitbart News had identified as one of eight top Department of Homeland Security Obama holdovers President Trump could “fire or remove.”

In striking down Section 6, the portion of Executive Order 13780 in which President Trump limited the number of refugees to 50,000 annually, Judge Watson–for one of the first times in American history–asserted the supremacy of the judicial branch over the legislative and executive branches. Not even Judge James Robart, who stopped the first executive order of the same title (Executive Order 13769), went that far in his usurpations.

Robart notably excluded Section 5 d of Executive Order 13769, in which President Trump limited the number of refugees in FY 2017 to 50,000, from his temporary restraining order.

Also on Wednesday, 4th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Theodore Chuang, another Harvard Law School graduate Obama appointee and former bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, issued a similar ruling.

Though Chuang did not strike down President Trump’s statutory and Constitutional authority to limit the number of refugees on Wednesday, he did schedule a March 29 hearing on plaintiffs motion to enjoin the “specific provision of the First Executive Order [Section 5 d of Executive Order 13679]” in which the president set the annual refugee limit for FY 2017 at 50,000.

“The Court will resolve that Motion, which the parties have agreed should be construed to apply to the successor provision of the Second Executive Order [13780] , in accordance with the previously established schedule,” Chuang wrote in his decision.

HIAS, one of the nine major voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) paid more than $1 billion annually by the federal government to resettle refugees, is one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland case.

HIAS hopes to persuade Judge Chuang to double the number of refugees to 100,000 in FY 2017.

Should he rule in favor of HIAS on March 28, Chuang will accelerate the pending Constitutional crisis that may be set off by Judge Watson’s decision, as respected attorney Paul Mirengoff wrote at Powerline Blog and Rush Limbaugh suggested in his nationally syndicated radio program.

As to the number refugees who will be resettled in the United States during the balance of FY 2017, President Trump may take a page from President Andrew Jackson, whose tomb he honored during his visit to Nashville on Wednesday.

“John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it,” President Jackson said of an 1832 Supreme Court decision unfavorable to his policies issued by the Marshall Court.

President Trump’s attitude to the unfavorable decision issued by Judge Watson regarding a president’s Constitutional and statutory authority to limit the number of refugees arriving in the United States, a decision Judge Chuang may agree with on March 28, may well be something like this:

“Judge Watson has made his decision; now let him pay for it.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15adf806b0b:c3265:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Friday from the Oval Office at the White House after meeting with conservative GOP lawmakers, President Donald Trump declared Obamacare “dead.”

During those remarks, Trump took several shots at the media, who he said were trying to defend Obamacare.

“We are doing some incredible things,” Trump said. “I want everyone to know 100 percent behind this. I want everybody to know that the press has not been speaking properly about how great this is going to be. They have not been giving it a fair press. The press is — well in many cases, as you know, I call it the fake news. It’s fake news. This is going to be great for people.

“I also want people to know that Obamacare is dead,” Trump said. “It’s a dead health care plan. It’s not even a health care plan, frankly.”

“Only because everyone knows it’s on its last dying feet, the fake news is trying to say good things about it — the fake media,” he added. “There is no good news about Obamacare. Obamacare is dead.”

Amaal Elhaaj is fighting the same radical Islamic terrorism that threatens people around the globe, including in her home country of Libya. She is also a Muslim who agrees with President Donald Trump’s travel order and his effort to keep Americans safe.

In fact, Amaal and the eight other Libyans who were granted visas by the Trump State Department came to the United States to seek help from the United Nations and the United States to achieve stability in their country and to gain support for all Muslims in Libya, not just what Amaal calls “political Islam” in power there, including the Muslim Brotherhood.

Members of that delegation, made up of tribal leaders and women activists and organized by the National Movement of Libya (NML), believe that the political processes led by the United Nations in Libya have been more accommodating to Islamists than tribes that represent much larger areas and far more people, partly due to the influence of foreign powers, including the United States under the Obama administration.

“I believe Trump is not fighting Muslims just because they are Muslims,” Amaal told Breitbart News. “And the decision he made, I can accept it … because he has to make sure the people who enter America are not the wrong people.”

Amaal added that most Libyans are peaceful people who would not commit terrorists acts.

“They were trying to empower political Islam in Libya,” Amaal said. ”This is the truth.”

Amaal said NML isn’t advocating for the exclusion of Islamist groups, with the exception of terrorist groups, but that they want the U.N. to respect Libya’s demographics and strengthen cooperation with tribal groups and representatives of cities and civil society. NML consists of groups that both supported and did not support Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi during the 2011 revolution, with members reconciling with the help of facilitators.

During the delegation’s visit to New York City and Washington, D.C. this week, members met with officials from the U.N. Security Council, the U.S. State Department, the U.N. Development Program, the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom to the U.N. and the U.S. Institute for Peace.

Amaal, who fled her country in 2014 after being targeted for activism for women’s rights and human rights, including her efforts to be elected as the first female Libyan Prime Minister, said her countrymen who now live in the U.S. aren’t united about the future of Libya.

“There are some in the Libyan community in the United States that support the Muslim Brotherhood and are happy about what is happening in Libya,” Amaal said. “Many of those who support the Islamists have dual citizenship. But there are many American Muslims that work hard against terrorism, and we appreciate what they have done and are doing,” she added.

Libya has experienced years of violence and lawlessness since the NATO-backed ouster of Kadhafi, with rival parliaments and governments trading barbs and militias fighting over territory and the country’s vast oil wealth.

Militias loyal to former prime minister Khalifa Ghweil, whose administration was replaced by the UN-backed government last year, have stepped up a campaign of defiance against its authority.

For her part, Amaal plans to move back to a safe area in Libya and continue her activism.

“I want democracy,” Amaal said. “I want justice.”

The Libyan delegation was sponsored by the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers and the Libya Institute for Advanced Studies, with the support of Finn Church Aid.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15adf64df03:b90a1:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Hardball,” anchor Chris Matthews asked of President Trump, “Why does he hate Merkel? … She’s the best leader in the world right now. The public likes her, and she is functional.”

Matthews said, “Well, sometimes it feels like it’s Trump’s world, and we’re just living in it. Today, Trump world collided with the real world as president trump hosted German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the white house. The meeting, which was at times awkward, comes after candidate trump repeatedly criticized the chancellor, during the campaign.”

After playing a montage of Trump criticizing Merkel, Matthews asked, “Well, the joint press conference between the two was a stark contrast in leadership, and left you wondering who was the adult in the room, not wondering for long.”

Matthews further wondered, “Why does he hate Merkel? What is this about? She’s the best leader in the world right now. The public likes her, and she is functional.”

Sometimes big ideas get small coverage. Unfortunately, that was the case with President Trump’s March 15 trip to Michigan, in which he raised an important idea—arguably the most important economic-policy idea in U.S. history—and yet his words received almost no attention.

Perhaps that was inevitable, because, as we all know, White House reporters these days have been focused on the healthcare bill, and the new proposed budget, and various allegations about hacking and tapping.

Yet here’s a Virgilian prediction: Long after the sound and fury about those other controversies have passed away, Trump’s big point on the economy will be remembered. Indeed, it’s likely that the pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-profits alliance that Trump espouses will become permanently embedded in Republican thinking—and, quite possibly, Democratic thinking as well.

So what, exactly, did Trump say in his brief speech at Willow Run, the former factory site in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan? What was the larger message to the leaders of the Big Three automakers—Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors—as well as the head of the United Auto Workers, the governor, and other luminaries?

Trump started out by taking his listeners back to a time when America was at the zenith of its power. That was World War II. Back then, Americans were more confident and more united; they were all in this together, aiming to defeat Hitler abroad and, at the same time, defeat the Depression at home.

And no state better epitomized that “Can Do” ethos than Michigan. The Wolverine State was the manufacturing hub of the country, which meant that it was the manufacturing hub of the world. And it was that manufacturing strength, of course, that enabled us to defeat the Axis powers in less than four years. Trump recalled those years of American strength, and even included a wistful note about the manufacturing mojo that’s been lost in recent decades:

Great Americans of all backgrounds built the Arsenal of Democracy — including the legendary Rosie the Riveter, who worked here at Willow Run. . . . Seventy-five years ago, during the Second World War, thousands of American workers filled this very building to build the great new airplane: the B-24 Liberator. At peak production–listen to this, it’s not the country that we’ve been watching over the last 20 years—they were building one B-24 every single hour.

Without a doubt, Willow Run was an immense achievement. In June 1941, it was just a field, 30 miles outside of Detroit. And yet by September of the the following year, it was producing B-24 Liberator bombers, each with 488,193 parts, capable of delivering four tons of ordnance on a target nearly three thousand miles. By 1945, Willow Run had produced nearly 9,000 of these fearsome birds of war. And oh, by the way, it employed 42,000 men, and women, at its peak—including Rosie the Riveter (even if Rosie’s story is, shall we say, clouded by legend).

Yes, Willow Run is a stirring tale of get-up-and-go war production, and yet it is just one of many. In WWII, the overall American industrial war effort also produced, for example, more than 100,000 armored vehicles, 300,000 airplanes, and 41 billion rounds of ammunition. It takes nothing away from the courage of our fighting men in WWII to say that their job of victory was made infinitely easier by the typhoon of steel that they could unleash on the enemy.

So how did Uncle Sam achieve that miracle of production? The most obvious answer is that we had the industrial resources in place before the war, and so it was simply a case of ramping them up during the war. In 1939, for example, we produced twice as much steel as Hitler’s Germany, and our advantage grew during the war years, in no small part because B-24s, and other bombers, were smashing Nazi factories.

And yet as the complexity of the B-24 reminds us, effective production is more than just gross aggregates; each weapon, each airplane, must be designed and assembled properly. And so as we think about the nearly half-million components of a B-24, we can learn a lot from the 1956 memoir of Charles E. Sorenson, a top Ford Motor Company executive who became the chief of Willow Run. In that book, Sorenson outlines what it was like to build and operate what was then the largest shop floor in the world.

As an aside, we can note that the title of Sorenson’s tome, My Forty Years with Ford, takes us back to another facet of that bygone era, when a well-paid employee was loyal to a company and the company, in turn, was loyal to the employee. It’s in such a context—that is, a rich “corporate culture” that nurtures talent—that employees tend to do their best for their company, and for their country.

Of course, for every motivated white-collar executive, there were thousands of skilled blue-collar workers, and they were key, too. We can say: This is how quality manufacturing gets done—that is when employers and employees are so invested that they both work extra hard to improve the product.

The point here, to be sure, is not to sugarcoat that era; along the way, there were plenty of strikes, slowdowns, and other kinds of workplace trouble. And yet the proof is in the pudding: The B-24s got built, and we won the war.

So now we can see why Trump was smart to invoke the glory days of Willow Run.

Even seven decades later, the story of Detroit during WWII impresses and inspires.

In fact, that same productive spirit continued after the war, when Willow Run was converted to domestic auto production; that was the beginning of the post-war boom—that is, when factories for wartime production instantly becoming factories for peacetime production.

It’s been estimated that the U.S. government spent a trillion dollars, adjusted for inflation, to build all those defense plants during the war, and yet after VE Day and VJ Day, those now-surplus facilities were sold off to private manufacturers for just pennies on the dollar. Critics complained that it was a giant giveaway to corporate America, but consumers were just happy to have new cars, toasters, and TV sets.

Another decisive moment in the building of the post-war American Dream came in 1950, when the United Auto Workers settled a labor dispute with General Motors. It was a generous deal, setting a pattern of high wages for high productivity; it came to be known as the “Treaty of Detroit.”

History tells us that the Treaty, and others like it across the country, were a success. In those years, the American economy demonstrated that high wages, high growth, and high profits could go hand in hand. So perhaps it’s little wonder that Trump has cited the late 1940s and 1950s as one of his two favorite periods of U.S. history.

Indeed, as a look at historical data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve shows, in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, GDP growth was routinely three or four percent a year, or more.

By contrast, in the fourth quarter of 2016, growth was just 1.9 percent; as many observers have noted, Barack Obama was the first president in U.S. history never to have achieved three percent growth in a single year of his time in office. And according the Atlanta Fed, growth in the first quarter of 2017 could be just .9 percent.

So what happened? Where did our manufacturing mojo go? And what about our prosperity? As we survey the causes of damage, probably the biggest single culprit is globalization. It was globalization that broke up the old alliance of capital and labor.

To be sure, that alliance might not have always seemed like an alliance—it was uncomfortable at times, even hostile, on both sides. Yet it was always based on a blunt reality; the two sides were stuck with each other, and there was no other place else to go.

But then, with the coming of worldwide free trade and outsourcing, capital discovered, to its delight, that it had a new option: It could locate or relocate factories anywhere in the world. (And to its further delight, capital discovered that the U.S. military would likely protect its overseas investments, too.)

Thus it is that today, the U.S., having led the world in vehicle production for most of the 20th century, now finds itself ranked fourth in total passenger car production, producing less than 20 percent of the number of autos as China.

In the meantime, this data from the Economic Policy Institute underscores what happened to workers as a result: Whereas from 1948 to 1973, productivity and wages moved up rapidly in lockstep, since then, productivity has continued to grow, and yet wages have grown hardly at all. Thus we can see the result of globalization on the U.S.: slower economic growth, as value-adding manufacturing has fled, and yet for immobile workers, the impact was worse—a severe stagnation of wages.

Trump’s White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, nailed it in an interview last November: “The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia.”

So now comes President Trump, determined to undo the ill-effects of globalization by invoking, once again, the winning spirit of American nationalism. As he said in Willow Run:

You’ve heard me say the words, and I’ll repeat them, right now: Buy American and Hire American. It’s not just a motto, it’s a pledge. It’s a pledge to the working people of this country.

In fact, as we all know, even before entering the White House, Trump was deeply engaged in successful efforts to keep jobs in the U.S.

Yet of course, helping the economy, and workers, requires more than just ad hoc efforts, valuable as those might be. It also requires better policies, which the Trump administration is pushing, and important stakeholders are taking notice:

On March 17, the two largest motor-vehicle trade associations took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal, thanking Trump for ordering the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation to stop escalating the red tape on fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards. As the ad says, “7 Million Thanks to President Trump”—that being the number of American workers in the automotive sector.

In addition, Trump is working on the problem in ways that transcend the usual issues of taxes and regulation. Indeed, it’s fair to say that Trump seems to be moving toward a new philosophy for the economy. As he said in Michigan:

We must embrace a new economic model. Let’s call it the “American Model.”

Okay, maybe it’s not quite a new model; maybe it’s better to say it’s a classic model.

To Virgil’s ear, Trump’s use of the phrase “American Model” sounds a lot like an earlier expression of U.S. economic nationalism, “American System.” And that, of course, was the coinage of Henry Clay (1777-1852), who, after Alexander Hamilton, stands as the greatest champion of American industry in the 19th century.

Yet let’s let Trump himself describe what he has in mind:

Under this system, we will reduce burdens on our companies and on our businesses. But, in exchange, companies must hire and grow in America. They have to hire and grow in our country. That is how we will succeed and grow together–American workers and American industry side by side.

We can note immediately that the third word Trump used was “system”; it’s obvious that Clay’s American System is very much in the mix. Indeed, Trump’s idea of owners and workers joined together recalls a once-hugely influential 1851 book by the economist Henry Charles Carey, The Harmony of Interests: Agricultural, Manufacturing, and Commercial.

Of course, some might wonder if economic ideas from two centuries ago are still relevant. Yet in fact, they are very relevant.

Yes, the basics of the Hamilton-Clay-Carey vision are timeless. Why? Because a country needs manufacturing at home, not only for its prosperity, but also for its security. After all, in a time of crisis or war, the U.S. needs to be self-sufficient; that is, we wouldn’t be able to rely on imports for needed materiel.

Yet to have the needed manufacturing at home, a country needs all the basics: a good trade policy, yes, but also, a positive business climate, a strong workforce, and robust infrastructure.

Furthermore, as Trump suggested in Michigan, a country also needs a spirit of common purpose and patriotism that inspires owners and workers to pitch in to help each other. These were the lessons of WWII, and Trump deserves great credit for bringing them to the fore—even if the Main Stream Media didn’t seem to notice or care.

So yes, it’s true: Trump’s “American Model” has yet to be truly fleshed out, let alone implemented. And yet Virgil is optimistic about the idea’s future, because, as we have seen, it has such a glorious past.

Indeed, Virgil rather suspects that smarter Democrats will seek to grab hold of the same economic-nationalist idea; it’s in their political heritage, too: It was, after all, a great Democratic president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was on hand in 1942 to kick off the beginning of Willow Run’s production line.

In the meantime, to cite a pair of bad counter-examples, we might ask ourselves: Will any Democratic president in the future be as aloof as were Bill Clinton and Barack Obama on the issue of American jobs going overseas? Answer: Probably not. Virgil’s bet is that Trump has so demonstrated the political value of hands-on action for jobs that future Democrats in the White House will follow his precedent.

Yet whether the Democrats are on board or not, Republicans should think hard about the vision Trump is putting forth, even if it is at odds with the doctrinaire globo-libertarianism that has so long predominated.

For America, the stakes are high. Ultimately, both our prosperity and security as a country depend on our willingness to come together around the idea of revived domestic production.

To be sure, as a nation, we’re a long way from where we need to be. Yet in the meantime, if we need inspiration for the trek ahead, we can think about Willow Run, its leader, Charles Sorenson, and its most famous worker, Rosie the Riveter.

Back then, as a team, they knew how to work together to win.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15adf1218cf:58f42:36043a10</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

CEOs from leading tech companies such as Tumblr, Slack, Foursquare, and Reddit have sent a letter to House and Senate leaders, urging them to continue Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding.

We’re calling on the tech industry to join Tumblr in standing with @PPFA: https://t.co/CpJw00pqSP #TechStandsWithPP pic.twitter.com/yVGiF5Plxj — Tumblr (@tumblr) March 10, 2017

The letter, which is being promoted on a Planned Parenthood website, is addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and is signed by 74 tech leaders.

“We urge Congress not to pursue any legislation that blocks women from accessing critical preventive care – including well-woman exams, birth control, and cancer screenings – at Planned Parenthood health centers,” the CEOs write.

“One in five women in America has relied on Planned Parenthood for health care at some point in her lifetime,” the leaders say. “And of course, men and members of the LGBTQ community rely on Planned Parenthood for quality health care too.”

The CEOs go on to say the work Planned Parenthood does “so closely resembles what we stand for as leaders in technology: creating opportunity for everyone to chart their own path in life and pursue their own ingenuity – without barriers or fear.”

Tumblr CEO David Karp and Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards kicked off the #TechStandsWithPP campaign that supports the abortion chain on March 10 at SXSW, the conference and festivals held in Austin, Texas annually that “celebrate the convergence of the interactive, film, and music industries.”

“Corporate leaders need to recognize they are, in a way, political leaders,” Tinder CEO Sean Rad said during a panel at SXSW, NBC News reported. Last year Tinder also worked with LGBT activist group GLAAD to allow gender fluidity so that its users could identify as other genders in addition to male and female.

Planned Parenthood receives more than a half billion dollars in taxpayer funding annually and performs over 300,000 abortions per year.

Richards also recently tweeted that abortion is “vital” to Planned Parenthood’s mission, in response to a proposal from President Donald Trump that her business stop performing abortions in order to keep its taxpayer funding.

Planned Parenthood is proud to provide abortion—a necessary service that’s as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings. https://t.co/TWGOcVjBJ4 — Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 6, 2017

David Daleiden, producer of the undercover videos that alleged Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted babies for a profit, reacted to Richards’ tweet to Breitbart News, saying, “Abortion is equally ‘vital to our mission’ as birth control or cancer screening. So much for ‘only 3%,’” — referring to Planned Parenthood’s common claim that abortion is only three percent of its total activities.

California Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration is unhappy with President Donald Trump’s budget proposals and how they will potentially affect several programs and funding for some projects in the state.

“The president’s budget proposes a complete withdrawal of the federal government’s commitment to working with states to solve the critical issues of the country, from environmental protection and emergency preparedness to transportation and other infrastructure,” Brown’s budget director, Michael Cohen said, according to the Los Angeles Times.

President Trump has argued that many of the programs he seeks to slash funding for are ineffective or outdated. He has also noted that some of the programs to be eliminated or cut are repetitive. The National Endowment for the Arts, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Humanities are among 19 independent agencies being considered for elimination.

Brown’s administration is also concerned about limited grant funding for rail and transit projects. Last month the Federal Transit Administration delayed a decision on whether it would approve a $650 million federal grant meant to convert the Bay Area railway system, Caltrain, from diesel to electric.

That conversion is a key step for the completion of the plans laid out by the California High-Speed Rail Authority. California’s own Republican delegation opposes that plan (as do many Democrats). Gov. Brown made a specific appeal to President Trump not to block federal funding for that project.

However, as Breitbart News has reported, President Trump is enthusiastic about infrastructure, and could be interested in funding rail links that make more economic sense.

State budget writers are reportedly also concerned about $66.8 billion in federal healthcare funds that were included in Brown’s plan for the fiscal year starting on July 1. According to the Times, that figure represents “63% of the federal funds allocated under the state budget, while many of the other dollars are sent directly to local communities.” However, the Times also notes that “The allotment of healthcare dollars, found in the state’s Medi-Cal program, depend less on Trump’s budget and more on the fate of the congressional Republican healthcare plan.”

On Monday, Gov. Brown lashed out at Trump’s healthcare proposal on Twitter calling it a “harebrained scheme” and “a really dumb idea.”

Limbaugh pointed to the precedent set by the federal judiciary’s effort to deny Trump’s travel ban and argued it could lead to other limits on the president’s powers down the road.

Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh.com):

We are on the verge of a genuine constitutional crisis because of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opening the door for this Hawaii Obama-appointed judge to deny Trump’s travel ban the second time going, and I want to get into detail as to what this really means and what the left is really doing here.

It’s not a legal dispute. This is, as I said yesterday, is a silent coup that is taking place that I’m sure has been strategized since before Trump was inaugurated. But the profound, devastating possibilities that result from this in terms of a president losing all constitutional — do you realize with this judge’s ruling, I’ll tell you where this is going.

Let’s say that Donald Trump decides at any time in the near future that he needs to deploy troops, and so he does, and so a leftist activist goes to a court, shops and finds a judge, like the guy in Hawaii, and claims that Trump said during the campaign that he was gonna do X Y, or Z, whatever, and the deployment of troops is not really for the stated purpose, and the judge could shut it down!

This judge’s ruling has — if the guy’s not stopped, if the Supreme Court doesn’t overturn this, or if Trump doesn’t just ignore it like Andrew Jackson did, then we’re getting to the point where the president, because of the judiciary, will have totally lost constitutional authority to defend the country because of this little ruling in Hawaii that was made possible by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. And it’s all about this idiotic notion that a presidential candidate on the campaign trial making statements is the equivalent of an inaugurated president stating policy.

But even at that the judge doesn’t have the right to do what he did! He doesn’t have the congressional right, he doesn’t have the statutory right to do what he did, because basically this judge shut Trump down because, in this judge’s opinion, Trump is a bigot. And anti-Muslim means bigot, and we are not going to allow our president to represent us this way is essentially what this judge was saying.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15addfe74eb:3f1af:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump reacted to questions about his claims that the Obama administration had “wiretapped” Trump Tower.

After a German reporter asked if Trump regretted his tweets, he replied, “Very seldom.”

“As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,” Trump said as some of the media and the president’s staff laughed. Merkel looked at the president and then shuffled her note cards while looking at her podium.

Tim Allen opened up briefly about what it means to be a conservative in Hollywood in 2017 during an interview with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel Thursday night, explaining that one must be “real careful” in talking about President Donald Trump or else risk being beaten up.

“You’ve gotta be real careful around here. You get beat up if you don’t believe what everybody believes,” the 63-year-old Last Man Standing star told Kimmel when asked about his attendance at Trump’s inauguration in January.

“This is like ’30s Germany. I don’t know what happened,” he added. “If you’re not part of the group, ‘you know what we believe is right,’ I go, ‘Well, I might have a problem with that.&apos;”

Allen told Kimmel he had never been to anything like Trump’s inauguration before.

“This government does stuff big,” he said. “Just so many people, and when they show up, you know, the ex-president gets in a helicopter and there’s jets and marines taking him this way and there’s parades, but it looks like a Cadillac parade, everything was just rows of Cadillacs.”

“My kids were going, ‘Is this the parade?’ It’s like black Cadillac after black Cadillac and then a tractor,” he joked.

Allen was one of the few celebrities with positive things to say about Trump during the 2016 campaign. The comedian complimented Trump in January of last year, telling the Hollywood Reporter that Trump seemed like a candidate who “might be able to do the stuff that really needs fixing.”

“Give that guy the roads, bridges, infrastructure, power grid — just have him fix that sh*t for four years. He’s good at that,” the actor said at the time. “And he’s a businessman so he understands how debt load works.”

In an interview with Megyn Kelly after the election, Allen called out anti-Trump celebrities in Hollywood for being “hypocritical” during the 2016 campaign.

“What I find odd in Hollywood is that they didn’t like Trump because he was a bully,” Allen told Kelly. “But if you had any kind of inkling that you were for Trump, you got bullied for doing that. And it gets a little bit hypocritical to me.”

In his sit-down with Kimmel Thursday night, Allen also joked about how Americans are willing to embrace ever increasing surveillance as long as we recognize the brands associated with it.

“If the government drove down the street in a gray sedan with a camera on it, you’d be rioting, going to Washington,” he said. “But if it’s white, with emojis and ‘Google’ on it, hey, you’re waving at it! They’re taking pictures of your house!”

The president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) says President Donald Trump’s budget blueprint “takes a meat cleaver to public education.”

At a press conference Thursday, Randi Weingarten said to members of the media, “Budgets tell you priorities, and what you have here is a budget that tells you that President Trump’s priority is not public education. The budget takes a meat cleaver to public education.”

Trump’s budget hurts the working poor. From taking a meat cleaver to pub ed to job cuts,this is wrong. #SkinnyBudget https://t.co/01frtv4X5i — Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 16, 2017

Weingarten and public education advocates have condemned Trump’s push since the end of his campaign for school choice programs as a means to bring about social justice for families living in low-income areas. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos worked in her home state of Michigan to develop school voucher programs that allowed parents to use taxpayer funds to have their children attend public charter, private and religious schools. Trump’s nomination of DeVos signaled his pivot toward school choice as the primary theme of his education agenda.

Teachers’ unions especially say that school choice will draw taxpayer funding away from traditional public schools and toward public charter schools as well as private and religious schools.

Trump’s 2018 budget calls for an increase in federal spending on school choice programs by $1.4 billion, ultimately reaching an annual total of $20 billion. Additional spending in 2018 on school choice would include:

A $168 million increase for charter schools, $250 million for a new private school choice program, and a $1 billion increase for Title I, dedicated to encouraging districts to adopt a system of student- based budgeting and open enrollment that enables Federal, State, and local funding to follow the student to the public school of his or her choice.

“The budget also includes both back-door and front-door voucher programs that further an ideological crusade against public education,” Weingarten said during the press conference.

She continued:

What we have here is what we feared when Betsy DeVos was nominated for this job. That – just like she did in Michigan – she tried to defund public schools with the aim of destabilizing and destroying them, and then lifting up other things that had really shoddy…track records. That’s exactly what the Title I portability proposal does. It’s a back-door voucher scheme which, frankly, was expressly rejected in the recently enacted bipartisan federal education law.

Trump’s budget plan also calls for either eliminating or reducing “over 20 categorical programs that do not address national needs, duplicate other programs, or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds.” Among those programs mentioned are: Striving Readers, Teacher Quality Partnership, Impact Aid Support Payments for Federal Property, and International Education programs.

The plan also eliminates $3.6 billion in support for programs for instruction support, before and after-school and summer programs – all of which the blueprint observes, “lack evidence” of meeting the goals of improving student achievement.

Overall, Trump’s budget for next year offers $59 billion in discretionary funding for the federal Department of Education, an amount the plan says represents “a $9 billion or 13 percent reduction below the 2017 annualized CR level.”

More than $1.2B on vouchers &amp; backdoor vouchers, while $1.2B cut to after-school programs. This hurts working families #SkinnyBudget — Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 16, 2017

“The cuts to community schools mean that we are not going to take poverty on head on, we’re not going to meet children’s well-being needs,” Weingarten said. “The cuts in terms of lower class size mean that we are not going to be able to meet the needs of individual children, and cuts to professional development mean the things that teachers need to learn on an ongoing basis – there’s going to be fewer people for them to learn that.”

Breitbart News asked Weingarten if she had any comment about the fact that Trump’s budget blueprint maintains the current funding levels of $13 billion for students with disabilities under the IDEA program, and $492 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions.

“The funding for IDEA and the funding for Title I are not discretionary funding,” Weingarten responded. “It is required funding, and that is very important to have.”

“The HBCUs have asked for more funding,” she added. “They needed more funding, not less funding. And you can’t just have a photo-op with HBCUs and not create more funding for them. These schools have been under austerity for years, and if they’re going to compete with others, they definitely need more funding.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15add74d5f6:70c8ca:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump met with members of the Republican study committee at the White House today, endorsing the House effort to replace Obamacare.

“I want everyone to know, I’m 100 percent behind this,” Trump said after the meeting.

The president griped that the media was not reporting fairly on the bill.

“They have not been giving it a fair press. The press is — as you know, in many cases, I call it the fake news. It’s fake news,” he said. “This is gonna be great for people.”

Trump remarked that most of the members of the meeting were opposed to the bill, but that after the meeting they were ready to support the bill.

“These folks were noes — mostly noes yesterday, and now, every single one is yes,” he boasted.

But Trump still appeared open to some improvements to the bill, speaking in support of the ultimate product.

“This is a great plan. This is going to be fantastic,” he said.

The Republican Study Committee, once a collection of house upstart conservatives, has become more moderate in recent years as the more conservative members founded the “Freedom Caucus.”

But Trump appeared delighted that they were now in support of the bill.

“I just want to thank you folks and we’re gonna have a great, great health care plan,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15add5952c3:65fa79:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

CNN even assigned some poor reporter to cover the Commander-in-Chief’s selections of other people’s tweets. CNNMoney “Senior Writer” Chris Isidore appears to have drawn the short straw:

The Trump administration may have been forced to apologize to the U.K. for quoting a Fox News report. But that hasn’t stopped President Trump from retweeting more Fox reports Friday morning. The tweets, which cover everything from jobs to health care to terrorist threats, come the day after the Trump White House got into hot water with a key U.S. ally for quoting a Fox contributor.

Stop the presses, as they say.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15add5952c3:65fa78:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">On Friday’s broadcast of NBC’s “Today,” an interview given by Breitbart News editor-in-chief Alex Marlow to NBC News correspondent Stephanie Gosk aired featuring a number of different topics about Breitbart News.

Included among those topics were criticisms that Breitbart News is a “hate site,” the site’s relationship with White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, and the site’s mission.

Transcript as follows:

GOSK: You know, Breitbart is one of President Trump’s favorite news sources, once run by his top adviser, Steve Bannon. They see themselves as provocateurs, poking a finger in the eye of the mainstream media. But critics call them racists, anti-Semites and white supremacists. We sat down with Alex Marlow, the 31-year-old editor-in-chief, who pushes back against critics and the labels, defending the news site he’s worked at since it started in 2007.

MARLOW: We’re not a hate site.

GOSK: Do you think you’ve been unfairly demonized?

MARLOW: Oh, absolutely. Without a doubt.

GOSK: Breitbart has seen a meteoric rise, from a fringe start-up once run by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, the right-wing news site explode exploded during the course of the presidential campaign with 240 million views a month.

There was a former employee of yours, who called Breitbart “Trumpbart.”

MARLOW: Yes.

GOSK: Was that a fair criticism during the election?

MARLOW: Absolutely unfair criticism.

GOSK: He insists they will criticize the president if he breaks his promises.

MARLOW: If he makes good on those promises, he is going to get a lot of favorable coverage. When we feel like the president is not honoring the pledges he made to the public, he’s going to get critical coverage.

GOSK: Do you talk to the president?

MARLOW: I’ve spoken to the president on air, I believe, four times — twice when he was a candidate, twice before he was a candidate. And I have not spoken to him other than … since he’s been elected.

GOSK: How about Steve Bannon? Does he reach out?

MARLOW: Every so often. Not as often as I would have expected. I think Steve is a very busy man these days.

GOSK: Still, the White House and Breitbart seem to be in lockstep on most issues. President Trump’s unsubstantiated tweets that President Obama wiretapped him during the campaign, echoed an idea laid out in a Breitbart article published the day before.

Was the wiretap tweet because of a Breitbart article?

MARLOW: That I don’t know. I’ve heard things, probably similar things to you. And I heard that a Breitbart article played a big factor in it.

GOSK: The article never goes as far as Trump does, directly accusing his predecessor. But it argues that steps taken to investigate the Trump campaign’s links with Russia are purely political.

MARLOW: We’ve learned very little about any sort of nefarious connection between Trump and Russia. But what we have learned is there’s these incredible amount of leaks flooding out of Washington, specifically to undermine the president of the United States. And the media is gleefully reporting all of them.

GOSK: Who should the American public believe? Mainstream media? The federal government? Breitbart?

MARLOW: Oh, I would say believe Breitbart. I think Breitbart is —

GOSK: But why? Why should we believe Breitbart over what the federal government tells us about possible connections with Russia trying to tamper with the election?

MARLOW: Well, possible connections and actual connections are different.

GOSK: Yes, but when you have the federal government come out and say, we are investigating Russia, potentially tampering with the election, why as an American citizen should you not step back and go, “I should be worried about that”?

MARLOW: I’m not saying you shouldn’t be worried about it. But there’s been ample reporting, ample investigation. The entire world has been focused on this story. And I’m just asking for one piece of hard evidence.

GOSK: Marlow describes his staff as a mix of both reporters and activists — the site often blurring lines between news and opinion.

What is your mission?

MARLOW: First of all, is to be a great news site, covering hard-hitting, fast-pace, accurate, always accurate, information. Now, where we differ is that we’re admittedly right of center. We’re a populist, nationalist, grassroots conservative website.

GOSK: What is Breitbart’s position on immigration?

MARLOW: We don’t have a party line position on it. But I’ll tell you a few things that are pretty consistent. We believe that border security and national security is a serious issue. And we think that there is an American value system that’s worth being preserved.

GOSK: Do you think that American value system is in jeopardy because of immigration?

MARLOW: It depends. It’s in jeopardy because of immigration if people who are coming into the country do not understand the American values and don’t want to assimilate into American society.

GOSK: Its brand of conservatism has come under intense fire, frequently called, among other things, racist, because of headlines like this one from two years ago.

“Hoist It High and Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims a Glorious Heritage”

Would Breitbart print that headline today?

MARLOW: I don’t know the answer to that. It’s a good question. But, probably yes. And to be honest with you, I disagree with the article. I don’t disagree with us running it because it makes arguments that the — that flag doesn’t just symbolize racism to certain people. It symbolizes southern pride, southern heritage and states’ rights. Now, my personal view is I think we’ve moved on from that symbol. But, that doesn’t mean we can’t have a debate and discussion about it.

GOSK: Regardless of who it may offend.

Do you compromise civility in the defense of free speech?

MARLOW: In some cases that’s acceptable because of the fact that it’s proving a point about freedom of speech in that we used to raise a society that was supposed to be resilient emotionally. And now, everyone is looking for their safe space. And I think that’s a dangerous thing.

GOSK: One thing he doesn’t think is dangerous — President Trump calling the, quote, “fake news media,” the enemy of the American people.

That kind of extreme language, is that not damaging to our democracy?

MARLOW: I don’t think it is because I think in a lot of ways, as Steve Bannon put it, the press is the opposition party. That’s 100 percent the worldview that I have.

GOSK: Breitbart made its first significant break with the White House recently over the new health care bill. One of its concerns that tax cut for the wealthy. But, it’s worth pointing out, they lay the blame squarely at the feet of House Speaker Paul Ryan, not President Trump.

GUTHRIE: Alright, Stephanie, interesting interview. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15add5952c3:65fa77:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters in Seoul on Friday that the Trump administration is open to military action against North Korea as a last resort, and that the Obama-era policy of “strategic patience has ended.”

“The policy of strategic patience has ended. We are exploring a new range of diplomatic, security and economic measures. All options are on the table,” Tillerson told reporters at a press conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se. “If North Korea takes actions that threaten South Korean forces or our own forces, that will be met with an appropriate response.”

“If they elevate the threats of their weapons program to the level that we believe requires action, that option is on the table,” Tillerson added. He emphasized that the United States would attempt to avoid to the extent possible any military actions against North Korea, particularly those that may put North Korean civilian lives in danger. “We hope that that will persuade North Korea to take a different course of action. That’s our desire,” Tillerson concluded.

Tillerson also took the opportunity to once again call for China to take on a larger role in containing North Korea’s escalating belligerence and objected to China cutting economic ties with South Korea over the deployment of the America Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. “While we acknowledge Chinese opposition, its economic retaliation against South Korea is inappropriate and troubling. We ask China to refrain from such actions. Instead, we urge China to address the threat that makes that necessary,” Tillerson said.

Tillerson is currently in the middle of a three-nation trip to Asia, having left Japan on Thursday and scheduled to meet with leaders in China on Saturday.

The Secretary of State’s remarks regarding potential military action against North Korea follow remarks in Japan that emphasized a “different approach” to the rogue government in Pyongyang. “Part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach,” Tillerson noted on Friday in a press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.

The Trump administration has hinted at a change in America’s approach towards Pyongyang in other venues, as well. Earlier this month, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley told reporters in New York that the White House is “not ruling anything out” to keep North Korea from developing and using nuclear weapons. Haley described the THAAD system as a necessary response to Pyongyang’s insistence on violating UN sanctions with missile launches that could threaten Japan and South Korea. “We are not going to leave South Korea standing there with the threat of North Korea facing them and not help. The reason for THAAD is because of the actions of North Korea,” she said in response to Chinese and Russian opposition.

Following Tillerson’s remarks Friday, President Trump himself issued a warning to North Korea on Twitter:

North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been “playing” the United States for years. China has done little to help! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2017

Tillerson’s message towards China was also similar in Japan: as its largest trading partner, take a more prominent role in containing North Korea. “We look to China to fulfill its obligations and fully implement the sanctions called for,” he said. Anticipating Tillerson’s visit, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters Wednesday he was “optimistic about the future of China-US relations” and anticipated a positive outcome from Tillerson’s visit. President Donald Trump is reportedly working with Chinese officials to plan a U.S. visit by President Xi Jinping next month.

These statements represent a nearly complete shift away from what former Secretary of State and twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton described as “strategic patience“: a policy of waiting for the North Korean economy to implode and Pyongyang finding itself no longer able to afford to ignore UN sanctions and the rejection of the international community. This policy largely failed because China continued to trade with North Korea, providing the fellow communist regime a vital lifeline.

The response in Seoul to the new, robust U.S. policy is largely divided along partisan lines, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. Conservative leaders have expressed gratitude for Tillerson’s strong support for their country. “We highly appreciate his comments as he expressed a strong willingness to respond to North Korea’s reckless behavior,” Liberty Korea Party spokesman Rep. Choung Tae-ok told Yonhap.

One left-wing leader, in contrast, told Yonhap: “We are supporting the U.S.’s move to strengthen the effectiveness of sanctions against the North through cooperation with relevant countries, but we cannot help expressing concerns about the U.S. stance that there will be no dialogue until North Korea gives up (nuclear weapons).”

North Korea appears to have responded to Tillerson’s presence in the region with the publication of a “human rights white paper” condemning the United States as a serial violator of human rights, condemning the presidential election itself as a human rights violation against the American people and labeling the nation a “human rights desert.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15adccf5a4e:60cfc0:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Friday on CNN’s “New Day,” Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, doubled down on remarks he had made earlier in the week in Austin, TX at the South by Southwest music festival regarding the possibility of a U.S. nuclear war with Russia.

Moulton argued Russia had violated the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty and criticized President Donald Trump for not acting more forcefully against Russia for the violation. That he said raised the possibility of nuclear war with Russia should Russia use nuclear weapons against U.S. allies in Europe.

“Russia has not only violated this treaty, they have also changed their doctrine,” Moulton said. “For a long time, Russia and the United States had this sort of mutual agreement, mutually assured destruction, that if they shot their weapons at us, we’d shoot our weapons at them and therefore a nuclear war was unlikely to happen. But what Russia now says is that they will quote, ‘escalate to deescalate.’ They are willing to use nuclear weapons to deescalate a conventional attack.”

“And I think that the problem here is that we don’t really have a plan to deal with that,” he continued. “If Russia starts using nukes against our allies in Europe, we may well use nukes in retaliation. What if they target American troops — like the American troops who are training right now in Poland — with a nuclear attack? What are we going to do and how quickly can that get out of control? That is why this is such a serious threat and why the Trump administration has got to take this more seriously.”

Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), chair of the U.S. House Foreign Relations Committee, was forced to postpone his annual Women’s Conference at California State University Fullerton after anti-Trump protesters harassed and intimidated the speakers.

Members of the so-called “Indivisible” movement, a nationwide anti-Trump effort, said that they had not intended to do anything violent, and that they were not responsible for intimidating social media messages sent by some of their activists, the Orange County Register reports.

Still, Royce and the other participants in the conference felt that it was best to cancel, or at least postpone, the conference because of the potential for disruption and other problems.

In a statement, Royce described the reasons for canceling the CSU Fullerton event. The Register reports:

“A vocal and disruptive group of political activists has repeatedly harassed this year’s speakers in an effort to intimidate them and stop them from speaking,” Royce said in an emailed statement. “As my first priority is the safety and comfort of all involved, I have decided to postpone the 2017 conference.”

Organizers from Indivisible seemed somewhat embarrassed to have caused the cancellation of an event devoted to women’s issues. One told the Register that she would be willing to apologize if they felt intimidated.

Royce has been broadly supportive of President Donald Trump, though also critical on occasion. Recently, Royce voiced his concerns about proposed budget cuts to the State Department.

“I am very concerned by reports of deep cuts that could damage efforts to combat terrorism, save lives, and create opportunities for American workers,” he said earlier this month. “The committee will thoroughly review the administration’s foreign affairs budget request when it’s made available to Congress.”

Last month, a CSU Fullerton professor allegedly assaulted a pro-Trump student during a protest.

Kentucky Republican congressman Hal Rogers, who has spent more than three decades on the House Appropriations Committee, including six years as the chairman, rejected President Donald Trump’s fiscal year 2018 budget as Congress begins consideration of the president’s rearrangement of priorities.

“While we have a responsibility to reduce our federal deficit, I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed in the President’s skinny budget are draconian, careless and counterproductive,” said Rogers, one of the so-called “cardinals,” the nickname for the lawmakers controlling how federal money is spent.

Rogers said he was concerned about cuts to programs in Kentucky.

“In particular, the Appalachian Regional Commission has a long-standing history of bipartisan support in Congress because of its proven ability to help reduce poverty rates and extend basic necessities to communities across the Appalachian region,” he said. “Today, nearly everyone in the region has access to clean water and sewer, the workforce is diversifying, educational opportunities are improving, and rural technology is finally advancing to 21st Century standards.

“We will certainly review this budget proposal, but Congress ultimately has the power of the purse. As the full budget picture emerges in the coming weeks, I am optimistic that we can work with the Administration to responsibly fund the federal government, including those agencies which serve as vital economic lifelines in rural parts of the country that are still working to overcome substantial challenges.

“As the full budget picture emerges in the coming weeks, I am optimistic that we can work with the Administration to responsibly fund the federal government, including those agencies which serve as vital economic lifelines in rural parts of the country that are still working to overcome substantial challenges.”

Another top House Republican and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Mike Conaway, took shots at the president’s cuts to the agriculture programs.

“At first blush, I am pleased that the administration is working to restore the strength of our nation’s armed forces to make sure that our men and women in uniform have the equipment that they need to defend our country and our interests around the world,” said Conaway, a Texas Republican who also sits on both the Intelligence and Armed Services Committee.

“On the USDA budget, I am concerned that the cuts, while relatively small in the context of the total federal budget, could hamper some vital work of the department,” he said. “I think it is very important to remember that net farm income is down 50 percent from where it stood just four years ago. America’s farmers and ranchers are struggling, and we need to be extremely careful not to exacerbate these conditions. In fact, we need to do all we can to be there to help our farmers and ranchers. The work they do is critical.

America’s farmers and ranchers are struggling, and we need to be extremely careful not to exacerbate these conditions. In fact, we need to do all we can to be there to help our farmers and ranchers.”

Another Republican taking on the president’s budget cuts is Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio).

“The Great Lakes are an invaluable resource to Ohio, and The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a successful public-private partnership that helps protect both our environment and our economy,” Portman said.

“The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has been a critical tool in our efforts to help protect and restore Lake Erie, and when the Obama administration proposed cuts to the program, I helped lead the effort to restore full funding,” he said. “I have long championed this program, and I’m committed to continuing to do everything I can to protect and preserve Lake Erie, including preserving this critical program and its funding.”

When he announced the president’s budget, Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, explained that his budget request was based on Trump’s own speeches and campaign promises.

“Knowing what you know about the President, you could imagine what that budget would look like before you even see it, which is that there will be more money on defense – $54 billion,” Mulvaney said.

“There’s more money for enforcing security at the border. There’s more money for enforcing laws on the books just generally. Then, there’s more money for things like private and public school choice,” he said.

“Conversely, since the President wanted to do that without adding to the already-projected $488 billion deficit in fiscal year 2018, there were reductions elsewhere to offset dollar for dollar, all of those increases,” he said.

Taking the opposite tact was Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he was willing to accept cuts to the State Department and other projects under his jurisdiction as long as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is comfortable with the loss of budget funds.

“Secretary Tillerson has said he willingly accepts this challenge, and I look forward to sitting down with him soon to discuss this proposal and how he believes he can accomplish his work at these budget levels,” he said.

“At the end of the day, while the administration proposes a budget, ultimately it is the role of Congress to dispose it and fund government,” he said. I believe we can strike an appropriate balance that recognizes the critical role of diplomacy in keeping our military out of harm’s way and appropriately advancing our nation’s interests while ensuring taxpayer dollars are used in the most efficient and effective manner.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and several other Democrats sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Monday threatening a government shutdown in April if Congress approves funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall.

However, in 2006, Schumer, along with 25 other Democrats, voted for President George W. Bush’s Secure Fence Act, which built 700 miles (1,000 km) of a protective barrier between the United States-Mexico border.

Part of the letter Schumer and other Democrats sent to McConnell read, “We believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of (wall) funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump’s administration.”

A copy of the letter was provided to the Associated Press.

The letter also made clear that including any “poison pill riders” — also known as wrecking amendments — in the bill would result in severe blowback.

“If Republicans insist on inserting poison pill riders such as defunding Planned Parenthood, building a border wall, or starting a deportation force, they will be shutting down the government and delivering a severe blow to our economy,” the letter continued.

The federal government is slated to run out of funding on April 28 — a scenario that can only be avoided if Congress passes a spending bill.

In 2013, the government shut down for the first time in 17 years for 16 days after Congress was unable to agree on a budget for the 2014 fiscal year. Republicans sought to block funding for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).

According to Standards &amp; Poor’s, the shutdown cost the United States $24 billion. Now, Democrats are threatening to similarly shut the government down.

Monday’s letter also stated that the Democrats were “committed” to working with Republicans. “Rather than pursuing this partisan path, we hope both sides can work together to ensure the government remains funded going forward,” Schumer and the Democrats wrote.

Earlier this month, Schumer publicly declared that he does not see “any place” where he and the Democrats in the Senate can work with President Trump.

While Republicans would be able to pass a budget with 60 votes, or a simple majority, they would need at least eight Democratic votes as well.

On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that President Trump’s proposed budget is “dead on arrival.”

Krauthammer stated [relevant remarks begin around 4:35] that the budget proposal is “dead on arrival on Capitol Hill.”

He then turned to the substance of the budget proposal, arguing that the defense increases “had to be done” after the “destruction” of the defense budget under Obama.

Krauthammer added that the problem with the budget proposal is that it doesn’t touch entitlements, which are huge drivers of government spending. He continued that the lack of entitlement reforms forced huge cuts in domestic discretionary spending, that “are never going to happen.”

The fake news establishment media at CNN is at it again. Now they are attacking Fox News host Sean Hannity, smearing his reputation with a phony story about him allegedly pointing a gun at liberal Fox News contributor Juan Williams.

Dylan Byers, one of the media writers at CNN who works for media industry defender Brian Stelter, printed a story on Thursday alleging: “Last year, after ending one of his many spirited on-air arguments with liberal contributor Juan Williams, Hannity pulled out a gun and pointed it directly at Williams.” Byers cited “three sources with knowledge of the incident” to make the claim.

“He even turned on the laser sight, causing a red dot to bob around on Williams’ body,” Byers wrote, adding in parentheses: “Hannity was just showing off, the sources said, but the unforeseen off-camera antic clearly disturbed Williams and others on set.”

Byers added in the next paragraph that the alleged incident was investigated, and it was determined nothing bad happened.

“For the record: Hannity’s colleagues brought the Williams incident to the attention of Fox News executives, though it’s not clear whether anything came of it,” Byers wrote. “The sources said it went to Bill Shine, the network’s co-president and longtime Fox News executive, who is Hannity’s longtime friend and a former producer. A Fox News spokesperson said the incident was referred to the legal and human resources departments.”

Byers buried deep in the story the actual quotes from Fox News itself, and Hannity and Williams themselves. All of them say are saying the incident is being way overblown by CNN, which is one of Fox’s competitors, is lagging behind Fox in the ratings, and is constantly under fire for printing fake news stories like this one.

“Sean Hannity has been trained in firearm safety since he was 11 years old and has a license to carry a gun in five states, including New York,” Fox News said in its statement. “The situation was thoroughly investigated and it was found that no one was put in any danger.”

Hannity himself says that CNN’s interpretation of events is “outright false reporting.”

“While discussing the issue of firearms, I showed my good friend Juan Williams my unloaded firearm in a professional and safe manner for educational purposes only,” Hannity said. “Every precautionary procedure that I have been trained in since the age of 11 was followed. I’ve had a conceal carry permit in five states for all of my adult life. Any other interpretation of this is outright false reporting.”

The kicker is Williams himself says the whole thing is being blown way out of proportion.

“This incident is being sensationalized — everything was under total control throughout and I never felt like I was put in harm’s way,” Williams said, according to the CNN report. “It was clear that Sean put my safety and security above all else and we continue to be great friends.”

Williams even took to Twitter to defend Hannity:

(1/2) This incident is being sensationalized – everything was under total control throughout and I never felt like I was put in harm’s way. — Juan Williams (@TheJuanWilliams) March 17, 2017

(2/2) It was clear that Sean put my safety and security above all else and we continue to be great friends. — Juan Williams (@TheJuanWilliams) March 17, 2017

In response to Williams’ Tweets, Hannity called the CNN hit piece “fake news lies.”

@CNN fake news lies. Juan is one of my best friends. Love u my friend. https://t.co/ZqXsRXWHDw — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 17, 2017

@CNN is as hysterical and insane as Rachael Maddow. https://t.co/ZqXsRXWHDw — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 17, 2017

If Williams really had a problem with Hannity, and really did not feel safe, would he have said that? Probably not. In addition, Byers continued in his story by alleging that Hannity’s recent studies of Mixed Martial Arts — something the Fox News host and nationally syndicated radio host has been doing in his spare time — means he is “spoiling for a fight.”

“Off camera, he has become an avid student of Mixed Martial Arts,” Byers wrote. “He has a brown belt in Karate. He even has a personal sensei (martial arts teacher) who travels with him. Last year, Hannity and his sensei paid a visit to UFC champion Chuck Liddell to learn some new techniques. The visit was featured as a segment on Hannity’s show, which provides some insight into his passion for the hobby.”

But Hannity debunked Byers’ bogus Karate claim in another Tweet:

Oh and by the way. I never did &quot;Karate&quot;

In my life. Another lie https://t.co/eztXMHCHQE — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 17, 2017

Excuse me. I NEVER DID https://t.co/MBTvHQsrEX — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 17, 2017

So, naturally, according to CNN — the network President Donald Trump has called “very fake news” — learning self defense and properly and safely handling a firearm in a way that makes nobody feel unsafe is now somehow a bad thing.

Even though both of the subjects of his story — Hannity and Williams — have challenged the report, Byers is publicly standing by his report.

I stand by my reporting, Juan. Every word. 110%. https://t.co/vvYMdWCs4E https://t.co/Um7dZfIqnq — Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) March 17, 2017

I stand by my reporting, Sean. https://t.co/co72KuLxtx — Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) March 17, 2017

Hannity mocked Byers for standing by the fake news report.

Fake news hack. Of course u do. Lol. It&apos;s not true. Unless u r calling me and Juan liars. Shocking from &quot;White Lash&quot; network. https://t.co/1ueCKtPirX — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 17, 2017

And he noted that he has “years” of tapes of him discussing gun safety on television.

@CNN I have YEARS OF TAPE talking about gun safety. Years. https://t.co/f7MLVNTpy8 — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 17, 2017

It’s all too interesting that this latest hit from CNN comes as Hannity makes headway in exposing the media establishment that Stelter and Byers regularly defend. On Wednesday night on his Fox News program, Hannity detailed how NBC News is on a “corporate jihad against President Donald Trump.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ada715fa3:20066d:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

58 technology companies have signed an amicus curiae brief against President Trump’s latest immigration order, filed in a challenge brought upon the order in the state of Hawaii. However, tech giants such as Apple, Google and Facebook have not joined them.

The new brief focuses mainly on the impact that the companies claim the order will have on the technology industry, claiming that employees of their company refused to return home for fear of not being allowed back into the United States, and having to cancel an event for Syrian refugees who had become technology-based entrepreneurs.

A section of the brief details exactly why they are against the order:

President Trump’s new travel ban is no different. It will inflict the same substantial and irreparable harm upon U.S. companies and their employees. And in implementing the promise of a “Muslim ban,” the new travel ban suffers from many of the same defects as the first travel ban. It violates the prohibition against nationality-based discrimination that Congress established through the Immigration and Nationality Act. It exceeds the authority granted to the Executive. It is arbitrary and overbroad in scope. And it impermissibly discriminates on the basis of religion and deprives individuals of Due Process rights, thus violating the U.S. Constitution. In sum, President Trump’s new travel ban has not overcome the constitutional and legal deficiencies that led courts to enjoin his first travel ban. Accordingly, the new travel ban should meet the same fate as the first travel ban— it should be enjoined nationwide.

The brief currently has less than half of the 127 signatories who opposed the President’s initial executive order on immigration last month. Airbnb, Lyft, Patreon, and Kickstarter were some of the names still on the list. Notably absent however were companies who had signed on to the earlier effort, including eBay, Intel, Netflix, Twitter, and as mentioned, Apple, Alphabet, and Facebook. The absence of Twitter is particularly curious, since their CEO is also the CEO of Square, one of the current 58 signatories.

Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief said that companies could still join the fight against the order. “We do expect the group to expand,” he said. A spokesman for Uber Technologies Inc told Reuters that they were currently part-way through the process to add their name to the brief.

An estimated 41 percent of likely American voters believe the United States and its allies are losing the war against Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) jihadists, according to a new poll.

Only about one-third say the U.S.-led coalition is winning the war against the jihadist group, and nearly 1 in 4 are uncertain whether the United States and its allies are winning or losing.

The survey, conducted by U.S. polling firm McLaughlin &amp; Associates, also revealed that nearly 70 percent of Americans “fear catastrophic terrorist attacks by ISIS are coming to the U.S. homeland, possibly involving chemical or biological weapons,” notes a press release announcing the results.

When broken down by political ideology, more than half (about 52 percent) of respondents who identify as conservatives and a substantial portion of moderates (about 39 percent) believe the U.S. is losing the war, while almost half (about 46 percent) of self-professed liberals say we are winning.

“The challenge facing the new administration is not simply one of military strategies, tactics and resources. It is also important that the administration and Congress develop a new strategic communications plan for the war,” said Joel Rosenberg, a Middle East expert and New York Times bestselling author. “Washington has both the need and the opportunity to explain to the American people the magnitude of the threat we face, the true nature of the enemy, and the urgency of taking decisive action to win the war and protect the homeland and our allies.”

“Policy-makers would be wise to begin their strategic communications planning by taking a fresh look at just how the American people currently see the war with ISIS and identifying critical information gaps where more education would be helpful,” added Rosenberg, author of the newly released political thriller, Without Warning.

Conducted on February 20 on behalf of various U.S. and foreign clients, including the Trump campaign and Rosenberg, the survey polled 1,000 likely U.S. voters about their view of the anti-ISIS war.

The survey comes nearly a week before the U.S.-led 68-nation coalition fighting ISIS meets in Washington D.C. March 22-23.

President Trump has vowed to defeat ISIS and the overall threat of radical Islamic terrorism across the world.

“Today we deliver a message in one very unified voice to these forces of death and destruction. America and its allies will defeat you,” the U.S. President said in early February. “We will defeat them. We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. And we will not allow it to take root in our country. Not going to allow it.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ada715fa3:20066a:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Immigrants are canceling their food stamps over fears they could be deported.

Food banks and hunger advocates around the country from Tuscon to Baltimore have noticed a decline in the number of eligible immigrants applying for food stamps and a rise in the number of immigrants seeking to cancel their food stamps since President Trump’s inauguration two months ago, the Washington Post reported.

Advocates on behalf of these immigrants say that their fear stems from the possibility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would notice their participation in the food stamp program and deny them U.S. citizenship or deport them.

These immigrants are now going to food pantries and soup kitchens so that they can feed themselves and their families.

“They’re making these decisions based on what they hear in the news or information they’re getting from other people,” Miguelina Diaz, food support connections program manager for Hunger Free America, said. “People started asking questions right after Trump took office.”

Diaz said she recently helped two legal resident families from Queens remove themselves from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). One of the women, a mother of two, asked for help erasing her name from a local food pantry, as well.

Spanish-language SNAP applications to the Maryland Food Bank have fallen from 20 a month to zero, the Post reports.

According to the Department of Agriculture, 1.5 million non-citizens and 3.9 million children living with non-citizen adults received food stamps for the 2015 fiscal year.

Adults have to live in the U.S. for five years, be a refugee, or be disabled before they qualify to receive food stamps. Children who entered legally qualify sooner.

Illegal immigrants who live in a “mixed eligibility” household can apply for food stamps on behalf of their children who are U.S. citizens.

The Department of Agriculture says in its formal guidance for non-citizens that there are no immigration consequences for legal immigrants who participate in SNAP.

But a draft executive order from the Trump administration from January sought to make receiving public benefits, such as SNAP, a reason for deporting or denying citizenship to legal immigrants.

Advocates for reforming the welfare system say that immigrants, both illegal and legal, have too much access to public benefits and take more out of the system than they pay into it.

“I don’t think it’s proper to increase the burden on U.S. taxpayers for people whose only claim to them is that they broke our law,” said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. “These children receive a large amount of benefits because their parents came here illegally.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ada715fa3:200668:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer squared off Wednesday against members of the White House Press Corps who questioned him about the Senate Intelligence Committee’s statement that it had not found evidence of any government surveillance of Trump Tower “[b]ased on the information available to us.”

ABC News’ Jonathan Karl asked whether President Donald Trump still stood by his claims that President Barack Obama had wiretapped his phones (or, more broadly, that the Obama administration eavesdropped on his campaign aides).

Spicer pushed back, challenging Karl about why members of the mainstream media had ignored reports that were unfavorable to the “narrative” of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, such as statements by past and present intelligence officials that there was no evidence of any such coordination.

He then read a full version of the “wiretapping” case, citing the various mainstream media reports describing surveillance of Trump Tower and of individuals close to the Trump campaign.

He also noted that the congressional committees investigating the president’s concerns had not yet received all of the evidence available — such as evidence at the Department of Justice, for example.

CNN’s Jim Acosta then claimed that Spicer had not answered the question Karl had asked. Spicer argued back vehemently. He did, however, enjoy a laugh at his own expense when he committed an inadvertent gaffe — or perhaps a Freudian slip — when he challenged Acosta to prove how he knew there had been no surveillance, and told him: “You have no intelligence.”

Spicer also cited Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), chair of the House Intelligence Committee, who said Wednesday that some surveillance of Trump Tower could have been swept up inadvertently.

Much of the media reporting of those comments had focused on Nunes saying that the president was wrong if his tweets — about Obama tapping his phones — were taken literally.

Conservatives have alleged that the surveillance of the Trump campaign — and the leaks of that intelligence to the media — could be evidence of a “deep state” effort to undermine the Trump administration.

Some opponents of the Trump administration have openly defended such alleged behavior by the intelligence agencies, claiming that Trump is a threat to the country and the Constitution.

On Thursday the U.S. House voted to repeal the gun ban for military veterans via the passage of the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act.

This is the second major gun control bill that the House has voted to repeal since Barack Obama left office. They voted to repeal the Social Security gun ban on February 2, the Senate follow suit on February 15, and President Trump signed the repeal on February 28.

The Social Security gun ban was egregious because it portended a loss of Second Amendment rights without due process. The gun ban for military veterans is more of the same. It is structured so that military veterans receiving disability benefits can be investigated if their benefit check is sent to a third party to help manage finances; the premise is that if they need help managing finances they may be mentally unfit for gun ownership. But House Republicans and Second Amendment supporters have pointed out that requiring help balancing a checkbook or managing finances is a far cry from being dangerous with a firearm.

USA Today quoted NRA-ILA’s Chris Cox saying, “Receiving assistance to handle personal finances does not mean an individual is unable to safely own a firearm. Our brave men and women in the military should not be stripped of their constitutional rights without due process of law.”

The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act is sponsored by House Committee on Veteran Affairs chairman Phil Roe (R-Tenn.). It passed by a vote of 240-175 and is designed to guard Second Amendment rights and the due process rights of military veterans. The NRA-ILA explained, saying, “The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act would ensure that going forward, veterans who use a fiduciary would not be stripped of their constitutional rights unless a judicial authority first finds they pose a danger to themselves or others. This ensures due process rights for all veterans.”

Retired General David Petraeus and others are working with Gabby Giffords’ gun control group, Veterans Coalition for Common Sense, to pressure Republicans into preserve the gun ban for military veterans.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has arrived in Tokyo, Japan, for the first leg of his three-nation tour of Asia, emphasizing the need for a new approach to curbing North Korea and pressuring China to take a stronger economic stand against the rogue regime in Pyongyang.

Tillerson’s first public engagement in Japan was a joint press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. Tillerson branded the approach to Pyongyang by both the Obama and Bush administrations a failure, noting that “the United States provided $1.35 billion in assistance to North Korea as an encouragement to take a different pathway” and got no results on moderating the communist Kim regime.

He directed the government of China, North Korea’s closest and most formidable ally, to pressure North Korea into adhering to international legal standards. “We look to China to fulfill its obligations and fully implement the sanctions called for,” he told reporters.

“In the face of this ever-escalating threat, it is clear that a different approach is required,” Tillerson told reporters. “The purpose of – part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach.”

Tillerson also emphasized the need for “trilateral cooperation” with an increasingly unstable South Korea, which just impeached pro-American president Park Geun-hye and is set to elect leftist rival Moon Jae-in in a special May presidential election. “Trilateral cooperation allows our three nations to coordinate actions on major regional and global problems, and more effectively counter the threats posed by North Korea,” Tillerson said. President Donald Trump has personally emphasized the need for strengthening bilateral ties and rejected the use of multilateral talks as a diplomatic device.

On his end, Kishida emphasized that, during talks with Tillerson, the two chief diplomats were “in sync” on how to approach the region’s most complicated problems.

“On North Korean question, we shared the position that we absolutely cannot condone nuclear as well as missile development by North Korea,” Kishida said, adding that both sides “discussed on [sic] the important role that China can play in this regard.” Kishida also thanked Tillerson and the U.S. government generally for their support in the East China Sea where Beijing has claimed the Japanese Senkaku Islands.

Tillerson will meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday before flying to South Korea.

Tillerson will arrive in China on Saturday, March 18, and meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He is expected to bring the same message of responsibility for the North Korean regime to Beijing as he did to Japan.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry, however, is attempting to convince reporters that they expect minimal conflict during Tillerson’s visit. During a press event on Wednesday, Premier Li Keqiang said he was “optimistic about the future of China-US relations” and insisted China is committed to enforcing United Nations resolutions against North Korea.

“It is true that recently the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia more generally has become tense,” Li said, urging “all the parties concerned will work together to de-escalate the situation, get issues back on the track of dialogue and try to find lasting solutions. It’s common sense that no one wants to see turbulence at his doorstep.”

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying was clearer in condemning both North Korea and South Korea – and, by proxy, the United States – for escalating tensions in the region. “The current situation on the Korean Peninsula is highly sensitive and complex. If relevant sides truly hope to see peace and stability in this region, they should apply the brake and put out the fire, instead of adding fuel to the flame,” she told reporters Tuesday, clearly intending to exclude China from her list of “relevant parties.”

As usual, Chinese state media outlets went further in claiming China has only a small role to play in controlling North Korea. “Some Western media outlets blamed the current chaos on China’s friendly policy toward North Korea, arguing that Beijing should impose tougher sanctions on Pyongyang to curb the latter’s nuclear ambitions.

This is unfair and groundless,” the Global Times protested this week. “By shifting the full responsibility on Beijing, the Western countries, especially the US, attempt to exploit the nuclear issue to strategically contain China in the region. This makes the already chaotic situation more sensitive and complicated.”

“The US cares more about its strategic aims than regional peace, and has failed to play an active role that it is supposed to as a major power in promoting peace and stability on the peninsula,” the Times concludes.

China provides North Korea with “90 percent of its fuel and 80 percent of its general use goods,” according to recent reports. Beijing recently halted all shipments of coal from North Korea for the rest of the year, claiming it a necessary move to adhere to UN sanctions. The announcement followed the assassination of Kim Jong-nam, dictator Kim Jong-un’s brother, in Malaysia using VX agent, a weapon of mass destruction. Malaysian authorities have traced the killers’ ties back to North Korea.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ada3a35b3:1c8dd9:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget requests $69 billion for the Health Department, a $15.1 billion reduction from last year’s budget.

The president’s budget contains cuts while mainlining vital health services. The budget proposal reduces the National Institutes for Health’s (NIH) spending by $5.8 billion to $25.9 billion. Trump’s budget eliminates the NIH’s Fogarty International Center, consolidates the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality within NIG, and reduces administrative costs and rebalances federal contributions to research funding.

The budget eliminates $403 million in health professions and nursing training programs, which the president’s budget proposal argues does not show any evidence of significantly helping the nation’s workforce. The proposal eliminates discretionary programs within the Office of Community Services, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIGHEAP) and the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG), providing a savings of $4.2 billion.

The budget proposal reforms the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through a $500 million block grant to increase state flexibility and focus on specific problems facing each state.

The proposal not only cuts, but also invests in mental health activities for high-performing service centers designed to focus on priority areas such as suicide prevention, serious mental illness, and children’s mental health. The budget includes a $500 million increase to expand opioid misuse prevention efforts and to increase access to treatment and recovery services to help Americans who are misusing opioids to help those in need receive help.

President Trump, in his message to Congress, said, “We are going to do more with less, and make the Government lean and accountable to the people.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ada3a35b3:1c8dd8:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Actor and activist Jesse Williams accused President Donald Trump of intentionally dividing the country along racial lines and called him “a pig” in an impromptu interview this week.

Asked by TMZ “how Trump is doing with racial injustice” in America, the Grey’s Anatomy actor replied: “He’s not.”

“He’s a pig who’s trying to make sure that he galvanizes as much fear as possible, particularly against black, brown immigrants, and Muslims,” Williams told TMZ.

Concerning Trump’s law enforcement policy agenda, Williams cited a series of police-involved shooting statistics.

“There were more killings at the hands of police this February than January and February of last year, 211 murders at the hands of police this year so far,” the actor said.

Williams has spoken out against Trump before.

In September, the actor and activist appeared in Joss Whedon’s “Important” political PSA alongside Avengers stars Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson to urge people to vote for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Last year, the actor was the subject of a petition calling for his firing from Grey’s Anatomy following his racially-charged acceptance speech at the BET Awards, during which he vilified police officers and accused white people of appropriating and then profiting from black culture.

Williams also protested in Ferguson, Missouri after the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. He later said on CNN’s State of the Union that “there’s a complete double standard and a complete different experience that a certain element of this country has the privilege of being treated like human beings, and the rest of us are not treated like human beings, period.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Monday, the National Iranian American Council (NIAC) hosted a panel discussion about President Donald Trump’s temporary visa ban, where the group’s policy director suggested the commander-in-chief’s executive order was a “white nationalist effort to change the trajectory of immigration” in the United States.

“Maybe a year ago it would have been crazy to say this,” Jamal Abdi said during the questions and answers segment of the panel. “But we’re in crazy times. This really looks like a Steve Bannon, Breitbart, you know, white nationalist effort to change the trajectory of immigration in this country.” He added:

And so, if you look at how this ban is constructed, it’s not just blocking new people from coming here. It’s ensuring that the people who are already here eventually have to leave. And Iranian-Americans, Muslim-Americans who can remain here, feel like second-class citizens and feel like they’re not welcome. And at the heart of it, I think that’s what this is about. This isn’t about some security argument or even some of the promises on the campaign trail. It’s this idea of changing America’s demographics because of this nationalism.

Factual analyses have dismantled this false narrative put forth by some in the mainstream media. While Trump’s efforts include a strengthening of American nationalism, he recognizes that immigration has played a key role in American history and he supports immigration through a legal means. The type of nationalism Trump envisions is not based on culture or ethnicity. In fact, Trump has rejected cultural or ethnic nationalism and has instead opted for a nationalism based on shared political ideals epitomized by the Constitution and the land those laws apply to.

The panel discussion, titled “Trump’s Ban 2.0: Justified or Discriminatory” also included David Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute’s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity; Amanda Frost, a law professor at American University’s Washington College of Law; and Barbara Slavin, who is the director of the Atlantic Council’s Future of Iran Initiative.

All of them were vocally against Trump’s executive order.

“Your risk of being killed by a refugee over the last 40-year period is one in 3.6 billion,” Bier said. “I would note that, furthermore, you don’t need to ban certain countries or certain nationalities to enforce screening procedures in the United States.”

Frost argued that while the temporary ban “violated the due process rights of the people who were affected,” the revised version of the ban, put in place March 6, is “from a due process perspective, much more acceptable.” She attempted to frame the temporary visa ban as a Muslim ban, using “context” from several statements Trump had made while he was still a candidate to make this claim.

However, the executive order is not a Muslim ban. The first order did not mention Islam or any other religion. However, the second order mentions Islam. Specifically, the word “Islam” is explicitly mentioned to note that the ban is not a Muslim ban. It reads:

While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities — whoever they are and wherever they reside — to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.

Indonesia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia – the largest Muslim countries in the world – are not included in the 90-day ban. The seven nations initially named in the first version of the executive order were drawn from President Barack Obama’s Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015.

One of the primary goals of the Trump administration’s temporary ban is to push for greater information sharing between the United States and Middle Eastern nations whose nationals are seeking visas to enter the United States. The order is a direct reaction to the rise in Muslim-led extremism throughout much of the Western world. Iran appears on the list due to its status as one of the leading abusers of human rights and sponsors of terrorism in the world.

The White House offered a brief description of Iran, taken in part from the Department of State’s Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016):

Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa’ida and has permitted al-Qa’ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.

NIAC is suing the Trump administration over the temporary ban along with three other groups: the Iranian-American Bar Association, the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA) and the PARS Equality Center.

“We are, indeed, continuing our legal efforts,” Abdi said. He added the second draft of the executive order weakened their legal claims but suggested, “we still have plenty, plenty of instances” and “the cases actually keep growing.”

He also suggested the ban on Iran would become permanent. “It is in the text of the ban that there is envisioned to be a permanent ban,” he said. He added, “additional countries may be added to the list.” Iraq was removed from the list, which he said was a result of the Iraqi government lobbying the Trump administration.

In the newly-revised version of Trump’s executive order, the White House notes, “In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal.” It is not clear whether Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen have agreed to similar arrangements.

Abdi said of Iraq’s removal from the list, “We don’t foresee that same type of connection happening between Iran and any Trump officials. At least, not as far as we know.”

At the end of the panel, Breitbart News asked Slavin if she had spoken with any Iranians who supported the temporary visa ban. “Apart from Saghar, who always comes to my events and says something about the Islamic Republic and how bad they are, no. Because it hurts ordinary people.”

During the questions and answers segment, a concerned Iranian-American activist Saghar Kasraei asked, “why are we supporting the Islamic Republic of Iran right now?” She suggested the focus of conversation should, instead, be on “a genocide of the Syrian people right now because of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”

Echoing NIAC’s Abdi, Slavin told Breitbart News, “this thing is just a propaganda gift to the regime. I don’t see how anyone in their right minds would support it.”

The majority of individuals who support Iran’s inclusion on the temporary ban say they do so on the basis that the regime is the world’s leading exporter of terrorism, particularly throughout the Middle East, Latin and Central America.

Hossein Khorram, an Iranian-American who “escaped tyranny like most of the 1 million Iranians who came to the United States,” is one of these people. He told Breitbart News he supports Iran’s placement on Trump’s executive order.

Khorram is a Republican activist and a former Trump delegate at the Republican National Convention. He told Breitbart News, “Trump won on the promise to strengthen the security of the American people” and “the Iranian regime poses an existential threat to the United States because they have been able to reach and penetrate the other five nations listed on the temporary ban. They have already dominated their own people, and they are now using the vehicle of terror to carry out the domination of surrounding countries using the nuclear option to carry this forward.”

He extended his criticism to NIAC, which he said “does not represent this community of Iranian expats. They have not reached out to serve the needs of this community. They haven’t tried to reach out to our community. They instead reach to those who think about normalizing relation between the United States and Iran.” He added that the regime has “violated the rights of women, minorities, and children and has blood on their hands.”

Khorram added, “I would say more than 95 percent of Iranian-Americans feel the same way as I do. This group is getting paid to serve a particular agenda. This agenda is serving the Iranian regime’s needs. It’s helping the regime survive. And the only people who don’t know this are the people on Capitol Hill and those in the Iranian government. They have an agenda and their agenda is not an American agenda, unfortunately.”

President Donald Trump’s much-anticipated 2018 budget proposal would eliminate discretionary spending on a wide range of arts and public radio and television programs, including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

Additional cuts would be made to the Smithsonian Institute and the National Gallery of Art.

Trump’s budget would zero out the $445 million budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a relatively small source of funding for programming and broadcast operations on public TV stations and NPR radio stations nationwide, according to the Washington Post.

The budget would also eliminate the budgets for both national arts endowments, which stood at $148 million each in 2016, as well as $230 million for the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which supports libraries and museums, the Post reported.

When asked about the budget cuts at the Conversations with Conservatives event on the Hill on Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, said he liked the “direction” of the Trump’s budget.

“We’re conservatives,” Jordan said. “We think you should plus up the defense budget and we think we should offset that with reductions to non-defense discretionary.

“That’s exactly what President Trump and the White House are putting forward. We really like the trend and the direction they’re headed and look forward to accomplishing those kind of goals.”

Public Broadcasting Service President and CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement that the PBS programming should be credited with “increasing school readiness for kids aged 2 to 8, support for teachers and homeschoolers, lifelong learning, public safety communications and civil discourse.”

The Budget also proposes to eliminate funding for other independent agencies, including: the African Development Foundation; the Appalachian Regional Commission; the Chemical Safety Board; the Corporation for National and Community Service; the Delta Regional Authority; the Denali Commission; the Inter-American Foundation; the U.S. Trade and Development Agency; the Legal Services Corporation; the National Endowment for the Humanities; the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation; the Northern Border Regional Commission; the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; the United States Institute of Peace; the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness; and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ada032bd0:174f16:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Trump’s proposed budget would boost spending on the military and veterans services in 2018, while cutting back on non-defense spending.

It would boost defense spending by 10 percent over the current 2017 enacted level, and veterans affairs spending by 5.9 percent, according to a White House blueprint released Thursday.

“The budget for [the Department of Defense] ends the depletion of our military and pursues peace through strength, honoring the Federal Government’s first responsibility: to protect the Nation,” it said.

Specifically, the president has proposed $603 billion in total defense spending, which includes funding for the Pentagon and defense funding in other agencies, such as the Department of Energy.

It proposes $574 billion for the Pentagon’s base budget — $19 billion more than what President Obama projected for 2018.

In addition to the $603 billion, the administration has proposed $65 billion in war costs — the same as the current 2017 amount.

The blueprint notes that instead of spending more on war — which it says consumes resources — the administration will “invest in a stronger military.”

The budget emphasizes rebuilding warfighting readiness, after 15 years of war.

Specifically it mentions rebuilding stocks of critical munitions, and dealing with personnel gaps, deferred maintenance and modernization, cyber vulnerabilities, and degraded facilities.

It also mentions spending more on training, equipment and infrastructure.

Those things highlight the budget’s emphasis on rebuilding the military versus just expanding it.

Indeed, the blueprint states: “The military must reset war losses, address recapitalization and maintenance requirements, and recover from years of deferred investment forced by budget cuts.”

“Those are really aimed at improving the current readiness of the military — so making sure the forces that we have today are actually prepared to go out and fight if they’re called upon,” said Todd Harrison, director of the Aerospace Security Project and Defense Budget at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The budget plan also pledges to grow the military — or at least reverse trends in reductions of forces begun under the Obama administration.

Specifically, it would reverse troop cuts in the Army and increase the total number of ships in the Navy.

It also pledges to spend more on training and equipment for the Marine Corps, and on future superiority for the Air Force.

Harrison says there is a risk in growing the size of the military without a long-term budget agreement, since it will only cost more to maintain.

He said with more forces, the budget will need to grow, but that “doesn’t necessarily mean that Congress will have the political ability to continue increasing the budget.”

“To quote ‘Top Gun,’ we’re writing checks that we won’t be necessarily able to cash,” he said.

The balance between restoring readiness and growing more forces won’t be clear until the administration formally releases its 2018 budget proposal, expected in May.

And it’s also not clear if Trump’s proposal will survive contact with Congress.

Defense hawks on the Hill want a larger defense budget, and Democrats are angered by $54 billion in proposed cuts to non-defense spending.

Any 2018 defense budget would need 60 votes in the Senate — including all Republicans and eight Democrats.

It’s also $54 billion more than what is allowed under budget caps set by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which kicked in when lawmakers failed to reach tax and spending reform. Congress would need to lift those caps.

“It’s a long way from being a done deal…there’s going to be a big fight in Congress over this,” said Harrison. “They need a compromise, and this proposal is not a compromise.”

For the Department of Veterans Affairs, Trump’s budget requests $4.4 billion above the current 2017 level, or a six percent increase.

The blueprint says it would extend and fund the Veterans Choice Program, which allows veterans to seek care through a private provider closer to home.

It also says it would support VA programs for homeless and at-risk veterans and their families; provide access to education benefits, enhanced services, and other programs to assist veterans’ transition to civilian life; and continue critical investments in improving the VA’s claims processes.

It will also invest in information technology to improve the efficiency and efficacy of VA services, and provides “sufficient funding” for initiatives for modernizing the VA and avoids the costs of “maintaining outdated, inefficient systems.”

The plan got an early endorsement from Veterans of Foreign Wars, the nation’s largest and oldest major war veterans organization. VFW Commander-in-Chief Brian Duffy said:</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ada032bd0:174f13:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The American Health Care Act cleared another hurdle Thursday when congressmen on the House Budget Committee approved the RyanCare bill 19-17 after more than six hours of testimony and debate with Rep. Dave Brat (R.-Va.), Rep. Mark Sanford (R.-S.C.), and Rep. Gary Palmer (R.-Ala.) joining the 14 committee Democrats opposed to the bill.

“I am proud of the work done by this committee. Our role in this process is to combine the work of the authorizing committees and report the full bill to the House and we have dutifully completed that responsibility,” said Rep. Diane Black (R.-Tenn.), who took over the committee’s gavel from Rep. Tom Price (R.-Ga.), now President Donald Trump’s secretary of Health and Human Services.

Palmer said there was no way he could vote for the RyanCare bill because it wastes the opportunity to seriously return the health care industry to a freer market.

“I voted against the American Health Care Act in the Budget Committee because the promises of changes in the future are insufficient,” he said. “Now that the bill has been reported out of committee, I will continue to work for the changes that are necessary to ensure Medicaid is a viable and affordable program to provide healthcare to the people who need it most.”

Palmer said he does support pieces of the RyanCare bill, such as reforms to the Medicaid program, which is block granted to the states in the bill, but even those reforms do not go far enough.

The American Health Care Act was crafted by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wis.) in private working groups that included congressmen, staffers, and business representatives. Capitol Hill sources have confirmed to Breitbart News that the bill was written precisely to bail out the insurance companies, who miscalculated their support of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

The source told Breitbart News that Republican lawmakers have all been told that nothing in the RyanCare bill can be changed or amended, lest it throw off the conditions that the insurance companies need to continue participating in the Obamacare exchanges and other programs that the RyanCare bill preserves. There have been no successful amendments to the American Health Care Act as it passed through the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Budget committees. Today the bill stands as it was originally written.

After the House Budget Committee, the RyanCare bill goes to the House Rules Committee, also known as the “Speaker’s Committee.” The Rules Committee does not approve bills, so much as they approve the “rule” governing how congressmen will debate and vote on the bill. Without a rule, the bill cannot come to the floor, except under a formal suspension of the House rules. Because Ryan stocked the committee with his allies, there is no way the bill does not come to the floor. The only question is whether the rule will allow amendments onto the House floor before the vote.

When the House votes on the RyanCare bill, the entire body will be converted into the Committee of the Whole House as if every member is a member of the Budget Committee, and Black as the chairman of the committee will be the bill’s floor manager.

This is critical because the bill stays under the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee through the vote on the House floor and Black does have the privilege of making manager amendments. These amendments are not subject to an addition vote and are used to make technical corrections, but they are also handy for making significant changes in a bill that reflect compromises struck after it has cleared the committee of jurisdiction.

To pass his health care bill, Ryan needs 216 votes, because there are five vacant House seats. There are 237 Republicans and the leading GOP bloc opposing the bill, the House Freedom Caucus, should be good for 30 votes. In the past, Republican leaders, including Ryan, have reached out to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D.-Calif.) to form a coalition or ruling majority to box out conservatives, but this time Pelosi wants RyanCare to fail, too.

There are changes that Ryan can encourage Black to make to the bill in order to pick off conservatives, but too many changes would jeopardize the true purpose of the bill, which is the stabilize the health insurance markets in a way that protects the dominant insurance companies.

The president is not the only one to point out that Republicans are stepping into a mess created by the Democrats.

Black, who is rumored to be considering a run for Tennesee governor, said Republicans had no choice but to act.

“There is always debate and disagreement during the legislative process, but I firmly believe that the result is a better piece of legislation,” she said.

“Obamacare is collapsing and we made a promise to the American people that we would save them from this disastrous law,” she said. “We have now taken yet another step toward our goal of bringing our patient-centered, free-market reforms to the American people.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ada032bd0:174f12:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Celebrities took to Twitter Thursday to bemoan President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget proposal, which, among other items, eliminates the budgets for the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

While the stars’ criticism focused on the broad nature of the proposed budget cuts, including deep cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, the bulk of the criticism appeared to center on the elimination of the arts budgets, which fund public media including PBS and NPR.

Some, including Billy on the Street host Billy Eichner and The Wire creator David Simon, lamented that the elimination of the NEA would cut funding to Sesame Street, though the long-running kids television program was picked up by HBO last year.

Thursday at the White House press briefing while answering questions about President Donald Trump’s “America First Budget,” Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney called climate change research “a waste of your money” regarding proposed cuts in that area.

Mulvaney said “A couple of different messages, when we talk about science and climate change — let’s deal with them separately. On science, we’re going to focus on the core function. There are reductions in the NIH, National Institutes of Health. Why? Because we think there’s been mission creep, we think there are things outside their core function. We think there’s tremendous opportunity for savings. We recommend a couple of facilities can be combined and there is cost savings from that.”

“Again, this comes back to the President’s business person view of government, which is if you took over this as a CEO and you look at this on a spreadsheet, and you go, ‘Why do we have all of these facilities? Why do we have seven when we can do the same job with three? Won’t that save money?&apos;” he continued. “The answer is yes. So the part of your answer is focusing on efficiencies and focusing on doing what we do better. As to climate change, I think the President was fairly straightforward saying we’re not spending money on that anymore. We consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that. So that is a specific tie to his campaign.”

Outspoken Trump critic Glenn Beck praised President Trump’s proposed federal budget on his radio show Thursday, declaring himself “pro-Trump” after highlighting the president’s proposed spending cuts.

The radio host gleefully read out a list of some of the agencies and programs Trump’s budget would cut, including the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, and so on.

“And my favorite: The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars,” he said, concluding the list.

Beck, who has written and spoken extensively about his dislike of President Woodrow Wilson, joked with his co-hosts that the inclusion of the center named after the progressive president was “an olive branch” to him from the Trump administration.

“Clearly, that was an outreach to you, Glenn,” show guest John Ziegler said.

“It was,” Beck agreed. “That was the olive branch, and I’ll take that olive branch. I am so pro-Trump right now.”

This is a dramatic change for Beck, who has been unrivaled in his invective against Trump. During the 2016 campaign, he regularly described the New York builder as a Hitler-like psychopath with supporters he compared to Nazi Brownshirts.

“It tells you a lot about this president. You can’t have the local mayor do that, but the president of the U.S. went out of his way to do that. I’m very glad my fiancée and I voted for him. In fact, I’m extremely happy,” Macias, who works as real estate broker, told the Los Angeles Daily News.

Macias’s fiancee, Sandra Duran, was killed by Estuardo Alvarado, 45, on Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles in a high-speed crash as he attempted to flee another crime scene. The pair had been together for 13 years and had a 12-year-old son together.

Police confirmed Alvarado had been known to them for years and had been deported from the U.S. on five separate occasions.

“Department of Homeland Security databases indicate Mr. Alvarado has been removed to Mexico five times since 1998, most recently in 2011,” Immigration and Customers Enforcement spokesperson Virginia Kice said.

Talking to the media, Macias criticized L.A.’s recently reelected mayor, Democrat Eric Garcetti, for his lack of response to the incident.

“I said [on the show] that the possibility of the president of the U.S. calling me first are probably better than the mayor or chief [of police] reaching out to me at this point, and that’s exactly what happened,” Macias continued.

Garcetti finally responded to the incident on Wednesday morning, offering the family his condolences, but failed to comment on the criminal nature of the incident. “Nothing compares to the pain of losing a loved one. My thoughts and prayers are with Sandra Duran’s family at this agonizing time,” Garcetti said.

Since taking office, Garcetti has vowed to resist Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts, and has set up a “justice fund” to help illegal aliens fight deportation orders.

Alvarado, who is currently being held at the Los Angeles Men’s Central Jail, has had his bail set at $2.18 million. On April 18, he will appear in court on charges of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.

Coming off a jobs report that figured higher than analysts expected, the Trump jobs boom is continuing with big-box retailer Home Depot announcing that it plans to add up to 80,000 new employees nationwide, perhaps by spring.

After revamping its online application process, the hardware and home improvement supply company announced plans to expand this year, the Staten Island Advance reported.

“Applying for a job at the world’s largest home improvement retailer now takes about 15 minutes using any device, thanks to a shorter application and mobile-optimized ‘careers’ site at careers.homedepot.com,” Home deport said in a statement.

Job openings will include customer service and sales, lot associates, receiving, store support, cashier positions, as well as jobs in the Merchandising Execution Team — those responsible for setting up store displays.

The announcement came as part of the company’s new “Behind The Apron” series aimed at telling the stories of employees.

The announcement by Home Depot comes on the heels of a higher than expected jobs report as hiring across the country measures in at its highest level in three years.

On Wednesday the federal government reported that the number of private payrolls increased by 298,000 in February, well above the original forecast of 187,000. January also saw levels of hiring revised upward to 261,000 jobs created.

The country has experienced higher growth since Trump took office. Only a day ago, for instance, President Trump praised Exxon Mobil for its plans to hire up to 45,000 new employees in facilities in Texas and Louisiana.

Wednesday on CBS’s “The Late Show,” host Stephen Colbert mocked MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow for her lengthy tease a night earlier that led up to the release of President Donald Trump’s 2005 tax forms.

“I hold in my hand something very significant,” Colbert said. “It is a joke — a joke that we have confirmed has been heard by Donald Trump. We believe this is the first time any joke dealing with Donald Trump has been released.”

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Germany’s finance minister is denouncing trade protectionism ahead of a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and a summit where global finance officials are expected to tussle over how strongly to support free trade.

Wolfgang Schaeuble said in a speech Thursday that “protectionism and nationalism are never the right answers.” He noted that countries are “more connected and dependent on each other than at any other point in history.”

“We cannot turn back the clock and reverse globalization… but we can shape it,” he told a forum hosted by the Institute of International Finance.

Schaeuble’s meeting with Mnuchin comes after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration criticized Germany’s trade surplus. Members of the Group of 20, a gathering of the world’s most powerful economies, will debate whether to confirm their rejection of trade barriers when they meet Friday and Saturday in southern Germany.

Last year’s gathering of the G-20 finance ministers issued a statement opposing “all forms of protectionism.” This time, early drafts of the ministers’ statement have omitted such unequivocal language, which in the final version could be softened to refer to trade that is “open” and “fair,” without the absolute opposition to import restrictions to benefit domestic workers.

Trump has repeatedly emphasized that the U.S. needs a tougher approach to trade that would put American workers and companies first. He has already pulled the U.S. out of a proposed trade deal with Pacific Rim countries and has started the process to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada.

His trade adviser Peter Navarro has accused Germany of benefiting from a weak euro that boosts its exports. Germany rejects the charge, saying it sells more abroad because its companies make competitive products and that it can’t do much to influence the euro’s exchange rate since eurozone monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank.

Ahead of his meeting with Schaeuble, Mnuchin visited his British counterpart, Philip Hammond, in London. The two underscored the importance of their countries’ close relations and their “desire to work closely, including through institutions like the G-20,” the Treasury said in a statement.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad90b29d2:1bf4e:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump’s newly released 2018 budget calls for an increase in federal spending on school choice programs by $1.4 billion, ultimately reaching an annual total of $20 billion.

According to the budget, state and local matching funds for public and private school choice could mean $100 billion total would be spent on such programs.

Additional spending in 2018 on school choice would include:

A $168 million increase for charter schools, $250 million for a new private school choice program, and a $1 billion increase for Title I, dedicated to encouraging districts to adopt a system of student- based budgeting and open enrollment that enables Federal, State, and local funding to follow the student to the public school of his or her choice.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES):

A public charter school is a publicly funded school that is typically governed by a group or organization under a legislative contract (or charter) with the state or jurisdiction. The charter exempts the school from certain state or local rules and regulations. In return for flexibility and autonomy, the charter school must meet the accountability standards outlined in its charter. A school’s charter is reviewed periodically (typically every 3 to 5 years) by the group or jurisdiction that granted it and can be revoked if guidelines on curriculum and management are not followed or if the accountability standards are not met.

The plan calls for continuing $13 billion in funding for students with disabilities under the IDEA program and $492 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions. However, Trump’s proposed budget would eliminate $3.6 billion in support for programs for instruction support, before and after-school and summer programs – all of which the plan observes, “lack evidence” of meeting the goals of improving student achievement.

Trump’s budget plan also calls for either eliminating or reducing “over 20 categorical programs that do not address national needs, duplicate other programs, or are more appropriately supported with State, local, or private funds.” Among those programs mentioned are: Striving Readers, Teacher Quality Partnership, Impact Aid Support Payments for Federal Property, and International Education programs.

Overall, Trump’s budget for next year offers $59 billion in discretionary funding for the federal Department of Education, an amount the plan says represents “a $9 billion or 13 percent reduction below the 2017 annualized CR level.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad8ef9def:8f964e:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Appearing in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, President Donald Trump said he would not be where he was if it wasn’t for his ability to speak directly to Americans through Twitter.

“Well, let me tell you about Twitter,” Trump said to Carlson. “I think that maybe I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Twitter, because I get such a fake press, such a dishonest press.”

The president also stated that he utilizes his “own form of media” and noted his massive following on the social network. “The news is not honest,” said President Trump. “Much of the news. It’s not honest. And when I have close to 100 million people watching me on Twitter, including Facebook, including all of the Instagram, including POTUS, including lots of things — but we have — I guess pretty close to 100 million people. I have my own form of media.”

President Trump also clarified his opinion of reporters in the media, saying, “Some of the press — by the way, some of the finest people I know are reporters. Reporters are wonderful. I’m talking about the fake media, the fake news. And there’s a lot of fake news. So if I’m not going to — if they’re not going to do me the honor and the public the honor of spreading my word accurately as it was meant, and you know exactly what I’m talking about, because there’s been nobody in history that got more dishonest media than I’ve gotten.”

“You look at some of the stories in The New York Times,” said Trump, “You look at some of the stories in The Washington Post. Take a look at what’s going on with CBS and NBC in particular and ABC — take a look at CNN. It’s a complete hit job. No matter what you do, no matter how good — no matter how great it is, they don’t report it in a positive fashion.”

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts published a study in December that examined how through Trump’s use of social media, “Twitter became news”:

“He knew that he would get attention and it would go beyond Twitter – it would be reported on the news and in late-night comedy [shows],” said Professor Gross. Those 140-character messages, which could be pulled up on screen by news programmes, served as “a mini press release”, he added. The medium “made it easier to spread whatever he was thinking very quickly”.

“In some sense Twitter made it easier to digest these and push them through the bloodstream of the American public,” said University of Massachusetts Assistant Professor of Political Science Justin Gross.

Bloomberg also noted following the presidential election Trump’s successful use of Twitter in spreading his message, allowing him to “reach American voters constantly and without an editor.”

Hannity categorized Maddow’s effort as being part of what he called “the alt-left propaganda media” and offered other examples in addition to Maddow of attacks on Trump.

Partial transcript as follows:

NBC’s corporate jihad against President Donald Trump continues. Plus, a new report from Circa News shows the investigation into a server connected to Donald Trump was, in fact, a politically motivated hit job pushed by a big-time Hillary Clinton donor. By the way, that’s tonight’s “Opening Monologue.”

All right, NBC has now hit a new low by releasing the president’s tax returns, or a small portion of them, last night. But what we’re seeing from the alt left propaganda destroy Donald Trump media — it’s not new.

Now that Donald Trump occupies the Oval Office, the opposition party press is going to new extremes and lows to try and take down his presidency, and they won’t stop until he’s out of office. Now, I’ve been saying since 2008 right here on this program journalism is dead. Now it’s in the ground, buried, flowers on top. And last night’s political hit job by NBC is just the latest example in the media’s long list of attacks against the president. Here’s just a small sampling.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here you have a deranged president, or a pathologically lying president, lying about the operations of the American government and lying about the previous president of the United States. That’s enough to invoke the 25th Amendment, but Mike Pence and the cabinet are not there yet.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he said today “America first,” it was not just a racial — I mean, I shouldn’t say racial, the Hitlerian background to it…

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I understand why so many people voted for him. I understand where you were coming from. I understand why you liked him. But this man is lying to you.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump’s critics, those who are worried about this president and this White House, saw a live special television event brought to you by narcissism, thin skin, chaos and deeply personal grievances.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was a whitelash. This was a whitelash against a changing country. It was a whitelash against a black president in part. And that’s the part where the pain comes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a really sad night. I’m just going to say it. This is a very sad night for the country. You can’t polish this turd.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don’t know — are you using the word lie or falsehood? What are you — what are you…

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, I think you have use — the word — the word — you have to call it what it is.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was interesting because I saw Sean Spicer on FOX News, and he said that you were rude. And I thought…

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What if you had called him a fake president?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HANNITY: Beyond awful. And when the alt left propaganda media isn’t doing what you just saw and attacking the integrity and mental health of the president, well, they’re running wild all kinds of bizarre conspiracy theories about the Trump campaign colluding with the Russians. Now, what the biased press refuses to tell you — there is zero — no evidence whatsoever that shows any kind of collusion.

Well, that didn’t stop the leader of the alt-left propaganda media, Rachel Maddow herself, from going off the deep end last night, claiming that in 2005, a Russian oligarch knew that Donald Trump was going to be president, so he bought a property from him in Florida and Trump made a huge profit, more than two times what he paid for it!

And as I said last night, Maddow thinks that somehow, maybe Russia knew in 2005 that Donald Trump would be elected president in 2016. Unfortunately, NBC News didn’t think that was possible even on election night. Now, that’s pretty pathetic, and the media should know better, but they’d rather put their radical left-wing agenda than telling the truth to the American people. That’s why they never vetted Obama. That’s why they colluded with Hillary.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad8b86585:89c48e:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Attorney Robert Barnes joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss his latest Breitbart News column, “Hawaii Obama Judge Rules Muslim Imam Has Special Constitutional Rights to Bring Anyone from Terror Countries into America.”

Marlow asked Barnes to begin by explaining why Trump’s temporary ban on various terror countries was blocked.

LISTEN:

“The district court judge in Hawaii, who was a fellow law graduate of Harvard law school with former President Obama – and, in fact, Obama was in Hawaii yesterday before the decision was issued, so some people have speculated on the coincidence of that. But he issued a decision that blocks the ability of anybody to enforce the order anywhere,” Barnes said. “So he went beyond just the district of Hawaii. He said no state can enforce it. Nobody in any part of the country can enforce it. Nobody anywhere in the administration can enforce it. He issued what’s called a nationwide injunction, and it precludes any application of the order, pretty much, on any aspect of the order, pretty much, until there’s further review.”

“His basis for doing so was an extraordinary interpretation of the right to travel and the freedom of association, which before, has only been associated with U.S. citizens,” Barnes continued. “Every court decision in the 200 years prior to this has said that people who are not citizens of the United States, who are not present within the United States, have no First Amendment constitutional rights. The Constitution doesn’t extend internationally to anybody, anywhere, anyplace, at any time. Instead, this judge said it did, as long as you had a university here who wanted to assert, quote-unquote, the foreigner’s rights, or you had some physical person here. In this case, it was one of the leading Muslim imams in Hawaii; he wants to bring over various family and friends from the Middle East.”

“The Hawaii judge’s decision says he has a First Amendment constitutional right to do so because he’s Muslim. It was one of the most extraordinary interpretations of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ever given, which is that because these are Muslim countries that were banned where the issue of terror arises from that that meant they had a special right to access the country and visit the country,” he said.

“As long as there is somebody here that wants them here, no president can ever preclude them from coming here. He basically gave First Amendment rights to everybody around the world and gave special preferences to people who are Muslim under his interpretation of the First Amendment,” Barnes summarized.

“So it’s an extraordinarily broad order. Its legal doctrine has no limits. If you keep extending this, it means people from around the world have a special right to access the United States, visit the United States, emigrate to the United States, get visas to the United States. There wouldn’t be any limit, and the president would never be able to control our own borders. It would be up solely to the whim of a federal judge who effectively delegated it, in this case, to a Muslim imam in Hawaii,” he contended.

Barnes noted that the judge did not “cite any prior decision” that has ever established this astonishing new quirk of the Constitution.

“Just last year, the Supreme Court implicitly said the opposite, when they said your right to association does not include a right to bring foreigners into the United States, in the Din decision,” he pointed out. “Now, there were several concurrences, so the binding precedent of that has been left open, but he does not even reference or mention or discuss the decision. He doesn’t even mention the statute, the main statute that gives the president the right to ban any alien from the country, for any reason the president deems appropriate, for any temporary time period, that the president yesterday cited in his national speech. Like the prior Ninth Circuit decision, the Hawaii judge never mentions the decision at all.”

“So there’s no real legal precedent. He’s taking three or four different concepts that have been applied in completely different areas of law, that only ever have historically applied to U.S. citizens, and he’s magically adding it to foreigners and acting like that’s always been the case when it’s never been the case,” he said.

“It is a product of what I call liberal law school education that was happening when I was in law school, which is they’re increasingly teaching lawyers to replace objective analysis with their subjective preference, but to pretend their subjective bias was really objective reality, even when it wasn’t,” Barnes said. “They basically taught you to lie to yourself about what the law really was and what it really stood for.”

“Obama reflects that, and this judge deeply reflects that,” Barnes asserted. “He’s someone whose opinion would be taken apart. If it was a first-year law school exam, he would get an ‘F’ because of how badly he misapplied the law. Unfortunately, in the liberal law school mentality, it’s what they’ve taught people to do. This judge, who’s a relatively recent judge, he’s been on the bench a few years, extended it in that way.”

“To give you an idea of how bad it is, yesterday, five Ninth Circuit judges dissented from reviewing the decision about the prior Ninth Circuit decision,” he pointed out. “The prior Ninth Circuit decision effectively became moot when President Trump replace his old executive order with the new one, and these five judges said that prior decision was so bad that they needed to vacate the decision and should vacate the prior decision, even though that’s very rare under those circumstances. They referred to the obligation to correct the ‘manifest many, obvious, fundamental errors’ that went against all the precedent the guy overlooked or neglected in the prior panel decision.”

“It was one of the harshest condemnations ever issued, and one of its authors was former chief judge of the Ninth Circuit Alex Kozinsky, who is regarded as one of the best and brightest judges from anywhere in the country, even though he’s usually more on the liberal side of the spectrum,” he noted. “What they all pointed out is it doesn’t matter what your politics are, the law is clear. There was no basis for the prior Ninth Circuit decision. Well, this Hawaii decision goes further than any court had ever gone before. Hopefully, it will get reviewed and reversed, but in the interim, the country’s safety is put into jeopardy because one federal judge decided to anoint himself the one Supreme Court of the country.”

Marlow asked if President Trump had any recourse, other than waiting for a higher court to overturn the Hawaii decision. Barnes suggested he could “always do a true Andrew Jackson, since he was there yesterday,” referring to Trump’s visit to Andrew Jackson’s grave.

“When the Supreme Court issued a decision, Andrew Jackson’s famous comments were, ‘Well, they’ve issued their decision; now, they can enforce it,’” Barnes recalled. “He was the last president to really challenge a Supreme Court usurping authority they did not have.”

“In this particular context, because it’s a district court decision – Professor Dershowitz even argued this, earlier in the cycle, when the Ninth Circuit even issued its decision – was that because there was a conflict between the courts, because you have a court in Boston that actually approved of the original Trump order, a great detailed order, 21-page order, cited by the five Ninth Circuit judges yesterday – the president would be in his legal rights to say: ‘There’s a conflict between the courts. Until the Supreme Court addresses this, I’m going to do what’s appropriate to keep the country safe,’” he suggested.

“The flip side is if he did that, the media would go on a field day and say the president thinks he’s above the law and is refusing to honor a court order,” he acknowledged. “He’s more likely to wait for this issue to get adjudicated. It ties his hands, unfortunately, and endangers the country in the interim, but politically speaking, he’s sort of put between a rock and a hard place. His only real alternative is to either go full Andrew Jackson or let it play out in the courts, and in the interim, the order is not enforced.”

“You definitely can do impeachment proceedings,” Barnes said when Marlow asked if there was any course of action that could be taken against the Hawaii judge for abusing his authority.

“I do think that all the political pressure put on the courts and all the public criticism by legal scholars and everybody else publicly about these decisions, and how reckless they are, and how dangerous they are to the well-being and safety of the country, and how anti-democratic they are, and how they mirror and reflect the aspects of Obama’s shadow government undermining the government through its Deep State connections and its undemocratically elected officials has real value,” he said.

“That’s even reflected in the decision of the five judges yesterday who were so harsh in the criticism of their former colleagues,” he pointed out. “They mention that the attention drawn to the court is a particular concern to them in jeopardizing the credibility of the court – because, at the end of the day, America’s courts only have power as long as people respect and believe and have confidence in the independence and integrity of those courts.”

“As that gets sacrificed, courts lose power, and we may return back to a time and place where someone like President Trump needs to go back to Andrew Jackson and invoke his tradition and legacy in order to challenge judicial usurpation of the safety and security of the country. At the current time, there’s not a lot we can do without being willing to go full Andrew Jackson against the court system,” he judged.

“Impeachment is always an option in the House. Some congressmen could pursue it because of these judges usurping their authority and invading the security and safety of the country, and violating the tripartite branches of power, where the judiciary is always supposed to have respected the president in this area. But right now, there’s not a lot we can do under the current political and legal environment,” Barnes concluded.

He agreed with President Trump’s contention that this level of judicial overreach was unprecedented.

“When you have law professors like Jonathan Turley or Alan Dershowitz or Jeffrey Toobin saying that the prior Ninth Circuit decision – which did not go as far as this case did, as the Hawaii judge did – saying it basically is bad law, then you know how bad the law actually is,” Barnes said. “It’s law that has no precedent, that has no historical application. For example, the Supreme Court and our Congress banned anarchists from coming into the country. It banned people that were Communists from coming into the country. We have always been able to use just mere ideology as a test.”

“We’ve also favored several religious groups, disfavored other religious groups,” he added, agreeing with Marlow’s example of how the Obama administration treated Christian refugees.

“This Hawaii judge is close friends with Obama, may have met with Obama before the decision was issued, is here condemning President Trump from just trying to keep the country safe as to who can come in. Well, if you apply his doctrine legally, how was Obama drone-bombing Americans and all kinds of people overseas? So you don’t have a right not to be drone-bombed, but you have a right to live next to somebody in the state of Hawaii or anywhere else in the country?” he asked sarcastically.

“There’s no logic. If you start to apply logically all of the consequences of this judge’s ideas, it goes to places that would destroy the whole concept of borders, destroy the whole concept of nationhood sovereignty, destroy the presidential prerogative to destroy our borders. There’s just no limit to where this judge’s decision could go,” Barnes warned.

He said there is no question executive power has been used in a discriminatory fashion against Christians “for almost the entire Obama tenure, particularly the Syrian Christians and others who were being actually harassed and persecuted.”

Barnes said the judicial action against Trump’s revised executive order dispelled the notion his first order was merely worded poorly or rolled out in a clumsy manner. “No, the problem is you have Deep State saboteurs, and you have unelected officials who think they’re above the law try to create the law, try to change the law, try to rewrite the law.”

“The problem wasn’t how he rolled out the prior order. The problem is, the opposition are people who don’t respect democratic elections and don’t respect the limits of their office,” he charged. “This problem is now right center with the way this judge issued his decision and particularly applying it nationally. He prevented every other federal judge, every other federal circuit, from weighing in on the decision because he unilaterally opposed it across the whole country – which both the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have said you’re not supposed to do, in cases just like this,” Barnes said.

“Judges think they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, wherever they want, however they want. The media will celebrate them. Nobody will do anything negative or adverse to them. And the only person pushing back on it is President Trump,” he said.

“It is clearly open season on prominent Trump supporters,” talk radio star Michael Savage told Breitbart News one day after he was reportedly allegedly assaulted at a restaurant in Tiburon, California.

Savage, who has been credited with aiding President Donald Trump’s election, said that he was not able to comment on the specific alleged incident. His attorney told the news media that Savage was verbally taunted and then assaulted by a restaurant patron.

Speaking generally, Savage told Breitbart News on Thursday:

It is clearly open season on prominent Trump supporters. The fascist left has been empowered by their own false narrative that those who support borders, language and culture – my motto – are evil fascists! This is how Hitler came to power. He used his brown shirts to beat any opponents. The media and police are almost wholly driven by this lie.

The Daily Mail reported on the alleged incident, citing Savage’s attorney, Daniel Horowitz:

Michael Savage, the 74-year-old host of the nationally syndicated talk radio show Savage Nation, was dining solo at Servino Ristorante in Tiburon, with his toy poodle, Teddy, keeping him company, when another patron allegedly began taunting him by saying, ‘weener, weener.’

The heckler was apparently referring to Savage’s legal name, Michael Alan Weiner.

As Savage was heading out the door, the verbal abuse allegedly turned physical when the jeerer knocked the septuagenarian to the ground, according to the talk show host’s attorney, Daniel Horowitz.

Mercury News further reported:

A Tiburon police spokeswoman said officers arrived on the scene on Tiburon’s Main Street at about 8:25 p.m. Both men involved in the fight claimed the other started it, according to an incident log. Spokeswoman Laurie Nilsen said the two men placed each other under citizen’s arrest and were released at the scene. A follow-up police report will be sent to the District Attorney’s Office for review to see if any charges will be filed.

Horowitz suggested it’s unlikely his client was the aggressor, given that he’s 5 feet 6 inches tall and 75 years old.

According to Horowitz, the incident started after Savage had finished dinner and was leaving the restaurant. The lawyer said the alleged assailant, who stood at about six feet five inches, approached the talk radio host “yelling insults.”

Mercury News continued:

After Savage told the man to “go away,” he started to turn. Horowitz said it appears that the man knocked Savage to the ground while also pushing his dog out of the way.

At that point, another customer from the restaurant intervened, and Savage’s alleged assailant punched him in the face, Horowitz said. Savage was somehow able to get back up and help the good Samaritan while also calling police.

“He called me from the scene,” Horowitz told Mercury Nes. “Truthfully, I think he was more furious than anything. He was saying he had just wanted to go out and have a nice dinner. He said, ‘This guy can’t get away with that.’”

On Tuesday, Savage’s latest nonfiction book, titled Trump’s War: His Battle for America, was released.

Salon.com recently labeled Savage the “talk-radio godfather of Trumpamania.”

Savage, a top-rated radio host and bestselling author of numerous books, is known for helping to define the nationalist themes of borders, language and culture. His daily three-hour syndicated radio program, “The Michael Savage Show,” is reportedly heard by 10 million listeners per week.

Trump was a fixture on Savage’s program throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and even called into the show the day of the election.

While President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts just $2.6 billion from the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency, the benefits for the American economy will likely be much larger.

The biggest economic benefits from Trump’s EPA budget would come from the complete elimination of funding for implementing the “Clean Power Plan,” the Obama administration’s scheme to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity generating sector. The plan would have cost consumers hundreds of billions of dollars in increased energy costs and inflicted even further damage on America’s coal mining sector.

Estimates of the costs of the Clean Power Plan vary, with the EPA itself claiming it would cost virtually nothing while industry estimates say it would cost consumers as much as $214 billion in higher energy costs by 2030. Energy Ventures Analysis, a consultant group that receives much of its income from the energy industry, has said that replacing otherwise perfectly good electricity generating capacity with Clean Power Plan compliant capacity would cost as much as $64 billion.

But even if the costs are smaller, stopping the Clean Power Plan will mean consumers have more money to spend, save and invest in America’s growing economy. And billions of dollars that would have gone to replace existing power generating facilities, can be invested in expansionary economic activity.

Defunding the Clean Power Plan puts into action the idea of “deconstructing the administrative state.” The Clean Power Plan’s demands for a radical reshaping of America’s power industry weren’t included in any legislation passed by Congress or signed by the President. They were the creation of career bureaucrats and Obama administration political appointees.

The Supreme Court went so far as to issue a stay of the plan pending judicial review, blocking the EPA from implementing the scheme pending judicial review. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard arguments over challenges to the plan in September of 2016.

Cutting the EPA staff by 20% may also benefit the American economy if it forces the EPA to backdown from its aggressive regulatory and enforcement agenda. Last year, The American Action Forum, a center-right policy Institute, estimated that EPA now imposes nearly 200 million hours of paperwork to comply with its regulations. It estimated that it would take more than 94,000 employees working full-time to complete one year of EPA paperwork.

“The agency’s burden has surged 23 percent since 2009 and 34 percent since 2002,” the American Action Forum reported.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad8131c05:77aa9a:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Trump and former National Security editor for Breitbart News, addressed the judicial injunction against President Trump’s revised executive order on immigration. The judge blocked Trump’s order on the grounds that it constituted unfair discrimination against Muslims.

“It’s very simple,” Gorka told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. “There is absolutely no way on God’s earth that they can make that case, that this is something to do with xenophobia or a religious group.”

“There is not one instance on the campaign trail or after the president took office in which the travel suspension was mentioned without reference to national security,” he pointed out. “It was never mentioned that we’re doing this because of a certain religious group. In every single instance, every campaign speech, every statement out of the White House after January 20, this measure was linked to the security of the United States. National security is the prerogative of the commander-in-chief, and immigration – including immigration standards and the issuance of visas – is not a local, is not a federal, is not a judicial function. It is a function of the White House and the executive arm.”

“This attempt to block a national security executive order will fail,” he declared.

Gorka said this interference with the president’s order illustrates “the depth of the problem” with judicial activism.

“If we truly believe in a republic, if we believe in checks and balances, and if we believe in separations of power, then the executive cannot bring constitutional decisions. That’s the job of the Supreme Court. Judges cannot behave as if they are the executive and determine what is good for the national security of the United States,” he said. “When they proceed to do so, they have stepped out of their mandate. They have stepped out of the way we constructed this country originally.”

“This is a perfect case study of just how much politics has intruded into the judicial sphere,” Gorka said. “As such, we have to welcome it because this is when the scales fall from the eyes of many, many Americans, and we understand that this isn’t about the law. This isn’t about the judicial process. This is about politics.”

Marlow turned the conversation to the release of President Trump’s budget and its basic theme of “raise military spending, cut spending from the various agencies.”

“If there’s one thing in the meetings I’ve been a party to with the president over the last eight weeks, one of the most trying issues for him, again and again and again, is waste – the gargantuan amounts of waste we have inside the federal government,” Gorka said.

“That’s why we have our rule that you can’t bring a new regulation unless two are rescinded in its place. That’s why we’re concentrating on what really matters to national security after eight years of cuts, after eight years of undermining our armed forces, and saving money where we can,” he explained.

“When you are as successful as Donald J. Trump was in the private sector, the bottom line really matters,” Gorka said. “This is a man who cares about national security but also cares about your pocketbook. Whether you voted for him or not, he is driven by saving money for the U.S. taxpayer, and that’s what you’re going to see in the budget.”

Gorka said the biggest military budget issue at the moment is combat readiness.

“The Marine Corps, for example, is having to cannibalize not old aircraft, but cannibalize current aircraft, that are in current use, to keep other aircraft flying. That is just untenable. This is the United States of America. We don’t do that. One of the key priorities is going to be making sure that our warfighters have what they need to prosecute their missions,” he vowed.

Marlow described President Trump’s $1.2 billion infrastructure plan that could be difficult to sell to budget-conscious voters and challenging to execute in a manner that provides good return on the taxpayers’ investment.

“As somebody who travels a fair bit, you just have to understand that if you go around other parts of the world – whether it’s Europe, whether it’s Asia, or elsewhere – we have lagged behind,” Gorka contended. “We have seen our infrastructure not looked after in recent decades. It simply is not at the standard that would match our role in the world.”

“So number one, there is a problem. Number two, when the president first announced this initiative, he chose his words very, very carefully. He didn’t say it’s one trillion dollars’ worth of taxpayer money. He said there will be this initiative, but it’s not all going to come out of your pocket. That’s very important to understand. We are looking at more than just the federal budget to fund these kinds of measures,” he noted.

“Lastly, it’s not pork barrel. It’s not simply projects, bridges to nowhere. It’s about getting America back on track, and infrastructure is essential to that. You can concentrate on jobs for Americans, you can concentrate on the automotive industry, you can concentrate on manufacturing – but if you can’t move those people, if you can’t move those materials, then it’s only one small part of the national economy,” he argued.

“Infrastructure is the veins, it’s the system, it is the lifeblood of the economy,” he stated, agreeing with Marlow’s proposition that effective execution of the president’s infrastructure plan would leave a “great legacy” for Trump.

Marlow asked if there was any progress to report on President Trump’s allegation that the Obama administration “wiretapped” his campaign.

“I’m not going to speak for the president, but as somebody who works in the national security sphere, I’m really concerned with this issue in general,” Gorka replied. “We have now had for months and months and months and months this absurd obsession, this talk, this insinuation of the Russian connection. Where’s the smoking gun? What is the former administration and their lackeys in the media actually positing?”

“There’s no ‘there’ there,” he said. “A phone call was made to an ambassador. Okay, but what else is there? There’s nothing. So that’s why the president said, ‘Okay, you want to open this can of worms? Let’s look at the whole issue.’ Let’s go right back to Russian involvement on Left and Right, as far back as the beginning of the Obama administration. Let’s shine light on this issue.”

Gorka said there was a deeper issue: “When we know that sensitive, highest-level sensitive intelligence, transcripts of conversations with U.S. individuals are being given lock, stock, and barrel to the mainstream media, that is what we call the political exploitation of intelligence. That’s not what happens in banana republics, that’s what happens in authoritarian nations. That is something that we must look into. When you start to use the intelligence community’s assets or their product for partisan political purposes, you undermine the whole democratic system. That’s why we want to shed light on all of these issues, to finally stop this kind of perverted exploitation.”

Marlow said Democrats seem determined to provoke hostility between Trump and Russia by pushing the narrative of Trump as either a sympathizer of Russian President Vladimir Putin or his pawn. He noted that Breitbart News was strongly critical of Russia during Gorka’s tenure as National Security editor and remains so under editor Frances Martel.

Gorka suggested asking Obama and Clinton hands like Ben Rhodes and John Podesta why the Democrats are pursuing this strategy. He chuckled as Marlow promptly issued instructions to invite them as guests for the next edition of Breitbart News Daily.

“I think there’s a couple of potential explanations,” Gorka speculated, to tide the audience over until such time as Rhodes and Podesta swing by the studio to explain themselves. “With regards to Syria, I think some personal animus was built up between Moscow and the last administration. Beyond that, I think it’s laziness. I think it’s scapegoating.”

“I take umbrage at your saying Frances takes a stronger line than I did, but we can talk about that later,” he added humorously. “My family history is very clear, what my parents went through under communism and et cetera.”

“The bottom line is they need an explanation for why they lost,” Gorka said of the Democrats. “If you cannot admit that your candidate was an appalling candidate who lost because she had no message except ‘I’m a woman and I deserve to be president,’ you’re going to have to find an answer as to why she was trounced. The easiest one is Russia, WikiLeaks, the KGB, the SVR, everything else. I think it’s handy, it’s easy, it’s lazy, it’s scapegoating.”

Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.

Former Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael Oren argues in Newsweek that President Donald Trump should pull the U.S. out of the United Nations Human Rights Council, saying the body has become a “racist” organization that coddles tyrants and attacks Israel.

Oren writes:

Over the past nine years, the UNHRC has condemned Israel 61 times, as opposed to its 16 resolutions on Syria and five on Iran. Denunciations of Israel outnumber those of all other countries combined. … Repelled by this bigotry, as well by the rights-violating regimes that often chaired its sessions, the Bush Administration refrained from appointing an ambassador to the council. That decision was reversed by President Obama, however, who believed that a U.S. presence on the body could redress some of its injustices, including that toward Israel. The decision disheartened Israelis who believed that America’s involvement would only legitimize the council’s prejudice. Unfortunately, our concern proved justified. Throughout the Obama years, UNHRC denouncements of Israel only multiplied.

Earlier this week, Foreign Policy reported that U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson had told non-profit organizations that the U.S. would withdraw from the UNHRC if significant reforms were not made.

That revelation was hailed by critics of the UN — but it was also applauded by fans of the UN, who saw Tillerson’s remarks as a sign that the Trump administration was, in fact, committed in principle to staying on the UNHRC.

Oren, who is also a celebrated historian of the U.S.-Israel relationship, served during the early years of the Obama administration and was deeply involved in trying to reduce tensions between Obama and Netanyahu over issues such as settlements and the Iran deal.

He is now active in Israeli politics as a member of the Knesset.

Obama holdovers are filling four of those positions: Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work remains in his position; Robert Speer is serving as Acting Army Secretary; Sean Stackley is serving as Acting Navy Secretary; and Lisa Disbrow as Acting Air Force Secretary.

The Pentagon said there are 10 other Obama holdovers still serving, but has declined to name who they are or what positions they are filling.

Trump has filled an additional 32 slots for non-Senate confirmed positions, for a total of 33 hires, including Mattis. That number is less than a fourth of the 163 political appointees at the Pentagon on election day.

The White House was expected to announce a handful of names for top political positions at the Pentagon as soon as this week, a defense official told Breitbart News. The White House declined to give a time frame for the announcement.

Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis on Monday brushed off suggestions it was taking longer than usual to get appointees in:

“You have to remember, eight years ago, we kept our secretary — Secretary [Robert] Gates at the time, so a lot of people stayed on with him, and you didn’t have as abrupt of a transition. For those of us who were around 16 years ago, it was pretty abrupt and we saw positions that went unfilled for many months. It takes time to interview, to find the most qualified candidates, to vet them, to get agreement on them, to send them to the Senate for confirmation.”

Trump has also named picks for Pentagon general counsel and Air Force Secretary, but the Senate has not yet confirmed them.

“There will be more to come. It’s a process,” Davis said. He said Mattis has “put a lot of names forward that are currently going through the final stages of vetting. We think that there will be multiple announcements coming very soon.”

Civil servants and former defense officials say the lack of political appointees has had an effect on Pentagon’s operations.

One civil servant complained privately that the Joint Staff — military staff who support a body of senior military leaders who advise the president — is running “roughshod” over the Office of Secretary of Defense, according to a former defense official.

The former official said civil servants who are filling leadership roles temporarily don’t want to formulate new policies that get ahead of Trump appointees who may change or disagree with them, and either sit silent in meetings or advocate for previous policies.

It’s not clear how that might be affecting several reviews the Pentagon is currently undergoing, including on the strategy to destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), on how to rebuild readiness of the armed forces, and on its nuclear missile defense posture.

Former Obama administration defense official Loren DeJonge Schulman said without a trusted agent from the Trump political team in the building to lead those reviews, it may be a more military-led process.

“There are fewer politicals, there are civilians who are not in power, and President Trump trusts the military more…the [elements] are there to have a more military-led process,” said Schulman, currently deputy director of studies and the Leon E. Panetta Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

“It’s hard to run a strategy review when you don’t have your political leader in place,” she said.

Another official at the Pentagon said it is possible the military is having more influence in policy discussions, but pointed out that at the end of the day, policy decisions go to Mattis, who despite being a retired-four star Marine general, is a civilian.

A spokesman from the Joint Staff said in an email to Breitbart News: “From our perspective, the Joint Staff is being participating, contributing and working collaboratively with OSD fully when, where and how asked,” he said.

Schulman, who first served as a special assistant to former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, said that what is more worrisome is that the lack of appointees is preventing important work from being done, particularly with foreign partners.

She said, for example, the prime minister of a small country who is visiting the U.S. may not meet with the president but will often meet with senior defense officials instead.

Now, she said, there is rarely anyone to meet with. Some defense officials have gone overseas to meet with foreign counterparts, but could only sit and listen, not participate or negotiate since they lack policy guidance, she said.

“Any meeting they go to which requires them to have a position or be a part of a negotiation, it either requires them to stay silent, or to rely on the old administration’s policy, or to have to go to Mattis and say, ‘Hey what’s our position on X, Y, and Z,’ and that’s simply not possible for him to weigh in on everything DOD does. That’s why we have political appointees,” said Schulman.

There has also been grumbling from Capitol Hill, with lawmakers complaining there is no one to talk to at the Department.

Schulman said it has always taken awhile for administration to get top appointees in place, such as under secretaries. However, she said under the Obama administration, deputy assistant secretaries put almost immediately in place in priority areas, she said.

“We’re not seeing that here,” she said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad7a4b0a4:7187a4:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump released his budget blueprint on Thursday, an effort to prioritize safety and security for the American people while dramatically cutting other agencies considered sacred cows by the left.

“To keep Americans safe, we have made tough choices that have been put off for too long,” Trump wrote in a message to Congress. “But we have also made necessary investments that are long overdue.”

The outline increases defense spending by $54 billion and increases funding for immigration enforcement as well as $4.1 billion investment for his promised wall on the southern border.

“We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight, do only one thing: Win.” Trump wrote.

The budget includes Trump’s promises to veterans, as the Department of Veterans Affairs gets a 10 percent increase in spending.

Trump cut funding for several agencies, including a 28 percent cut in the State Department, mostly because of cuts in foreign aid programs. The EPA also experiences a 31 percent cut, the biggest loser in the budget. The Department of Agriculture gets a 29 percent cut and the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor are also cut by over 20 percent.

Although there are over 13 percent cuts in the Department of Education, Trump’s budget proposes $168 million for charter school programs and $250 million for a private-school choice program, according to the Washington Post.

The Budget calls for the elimination of funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the endowments for the Arts and the Humanities.

“We are going to do more with less, and make the Government lean and accountable to the people,” read Trump’s message to Congress.

The budget outlines Trump’s spending priorities, but a more detailed document is expected to be released by the White House in May.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad789254f:6eeba6:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON, D.C. — On Wednesday Director Mick Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget gave some insight into the shift in department funding of President Donald Trump’s “America First Budget” ahead of its Thursday release.

“This is the America First Budget,” Mulvaney told reporters at a White House briefing. “In fact we wrote it using the President’s own words. We went through his speeches. We went through articles that have been written about his policies. We talked to him and we wanted to know what his policies were and we turned those policies into numbers.”

Mulvaney said increases like the $54 billion increase to the Defense Department would be offset in other areas of the budget blueprint to prevent any further increases in the budget deficit. The Director made clear that this does not mean that the budget is balanced.

“There’s more money for enforcing security at the border. There’s more money for enforcing laws on the books just generally. There’s more money for things like private and public school choice.”

The State Department and and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will also see cuts according to Mulvaney. He went on to say that reductions in the State Department were not a reflection of the President’s support, but rather that areas like foreign aid that face cuts, simply fall under the State Department portion of the budget. The State Department reductions will be around 28 percent according to Mulvaney.

Mulvaney went on to state that the budget being released is not a full budget, but rather a blueprint and only deals with the portion of the budget that makes up discretionary spending. He said that those who oversee the various departments are being given great flexibility in managing funds within their own departments. He also stated that the core functions and beyond of the EPA can be satisfied with the dollars included in this budget.

Asked if the budget assumes passage of the House Republican Leadership’s American Health Care Act, Mulvaney said generally no, adding that will be dealt with in a budget to be released in May.

The budget to be released on Thursday morning will also show suggestion for ending funding for public broadcasting according to Mulvaney.

NASA will see a very slight reduction in funding around one percent, but Mulvaney was clear that some areas within that area of the budget will see increases. He said space exploration remains among the President’s priorities.

This budget will not be a line-by-line spreadsheet.

Mulvaney said that the budget will show money allocated for moving forward with building a wall along the U.S. southern border. He said that the budget in May will show more, but that this budget includes allocation for pilot cases to find most cost efficient, safest and most effective ways to complete the wall.

Director Mulvaney said that the budget will be available online starting at 7 a.m.

The leaders of the House intelligence committee are giving the NSA, FBI, and the CIA until Friday to reveal how many Americans’ private conversations were improperly ‘unmasked’ amid legal surveillance activities in the last six months, which they believe happened to President Donald Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

The demand comes as the committee is trying to figure out who revealed Flynn’s identity during his phone calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December and who illegally leaked the classified contents of those calls to the news media.

“Masking” refers to the protection of identities of Americans who are inadvertently caught up in surveillance — for example, of foreign individuals in the U.S. — and is referred to as a “minimization” procedure.

Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-WA) made the request in a letter dated Mar. 15 addressed to Director of the National Security Agency Adm. Michael Rogers, FBI Director James Comey, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo.

“As you know, the Committee has been very concerned regarding the purported unauthorized disclosures of classified information, particularly when they pertain to intelligence collection on, or related to, U.S. persons (USP). To take a prominent example, a January 12, 2017 article in a major newspaper was the first to claim that ‘Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, [then President-Elect] Trump’s choice for national security adviser …. phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29.”

“Such stories would appear to contain the unauthorized disclosure of USP identities. This potential misuse is a key reason why the Intelligence Community (IC) has developed robust ‘minimization procedures’ for the protection of USP information, including requiring the ‘masking’ of USP identities in most circumstances,” they wrote.

“However, as recent news stories seem to illustrate, individuals talking to the media would appear to have wantonly disregarded these procedures,” they added.

Thus, the leaders have requested all policies and/or procedures each agency uses to determine when to unmask and disseminate the identity of an American and the number of individuals who can approve an unmasking.

They are also asking for the total number of times any unmasked American identity was disseminated between June 2016 and January 2017. They are also asking for the names of those unmasked Americans who had their identities disseminated in response to requests from intelligence community agencies, law enforcement, or any senior Executive Branch officials during that timeframe, in relation to either Trump or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

They also want to know who requested any unmasking and dissemination of individuals related to Trump or Clinton and why.

If those answers are not produced by Friday, Nunes and Schiff will issue a subpoena for them, they said.

The committee is scheduled to question Rogers and Comey at a public hearing on Monday.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad57da4d0:347dd1:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

King Salman of Saudi Arabia has departed Japan and arrived in Beijing where he and President Xi Jinping are expected to discuss expanding economic ties between their two nations, shortly after Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman completed his visit to the White House Tuesday.

King Salman will stay in Beijing for three days, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, and meet with Xi as well as Premier Li Keqiang and National People’s Congress (NPC) Chairman Zhang Dejiang. “China attaches great importance to the friendship and cooperation with Saudi Arabia,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Tuesday. “We stand ready to take King Salman’s visit as an opportunity to take China-Saudi Arabia comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level.”

While King Salman’s visit to Tokyo involved an honorific meeting with Emperor Akihito, the Chinese hope to use his presence to strengthen their foothold in the Middle East. Chinese state media outlets are heralding the visit as a chance for China to take over what was once considered America’s market to exploit.

Xinhua calls the visit an attempt to silence anti-globalization voices around the world. “As some scapegoat globalization for their sluggish economy, others remain open and cooperative to explore business opportunities and reap win-win fruits,” a Xinhua column on the visit reads, a clear reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s opposition to globalist forces. Xinhua credits China for having “helped build 56 economic and trade cooperation zones in 20 countries along the routes with a combined investment surpassing 18.5 billion U.S. dollars, generating nearly 1.1 billion dollars in tax revenue and 180,000 jobs in those countries.” Saudi Arabia, the outlet concludes, is seeking to be a part of that development.

The Global Times, often the more combative alternative to Xinhua, suggests Salman’s presence in Beijing means he “puts Beijing ahead of Washington in his diplomatic visits.”

“This reflects Riyadh’s tendency to ‘Look East,&apos;” the Times suggests. “The country is willing to develop a friendly relationship with Beijing on the premise that its ties with Washington remain intact. Saudi Arabia wants China’s support in regional and international affairs.”

The king’s visit has some competition, however, as Saudi officials celebrate the deputy crown prince’s visit with President Trump on Tuesday. The Gulf news organization Al-Arabiya cites Saudi officials calling the Trump meeting “a historic turning point” for bilateral relations. Al-Arabiya cites Bloomberg, which quotes a senior adviser to Mohammed bin Salman claiming the meeting “put things on the right track, and marked a significant shift in relations, across all political, military, security and economic fields.”

Among the most prominent points of agreement is the mutual distrust of Iran, newly emboldened by the Obama administration’s concessions package to Tehran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), or the Iran nuclear deal.

Trump had already discussed other Middle East hotspots, including Yemen and Syria, with King Salman in a phone conversation.

Unlike relations with the White House, regional rival Iran is not a subject that Saudi Arabia and China appear to agree on. China has historically supported Russia in the UN Security Council, which has developed a particularly strong alliance with Iran in Syria. Neither China nor Saudi Arabia have entered the fray in Syria, though both have expressed concerns that the six-year-old civil war appears nowhere near its conclusion.

China will also have to overcome Saudi distrust as it ramps up an internal war on Islam. While Chinese Communist Party officials have been permissive of Islamic practices, particularly among its Hui minority, it has taken the opposite position in western Xinjiang, home to the nation’s Turkic Uighur minority. Uighurs are a majority-Muslim people; in their region, the Communist Party has banned Islamic garb on public transportation, forced shops to sell anti-Islamic items like alcohol and cigarettes, and banned children from religious observance.

This attitude appears to be trickling east into Hui-populated regions. This week, the Communist Party secretary in Ningxia province, Li Jianguo, warned that the Islamic State was attempting to recruit Chinese people to engage in “jihad, terror, violence,” urging more vigilance over Muslim populations. The result of the government’s warnings over Islam has been a growing popular distaste for the religion, according to a social media overview by the South China Morning Post.

Such a policy is anathema to the Saudi government, which sees itself as the preeminent defender of Islam globally. “We confirm that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stands with all its might behind the Islamic causes in general and we are fully ready for assistance and cooperation with your sisterly country as regards any effort or movement that serves Muslims’ issues,” King Salman asserted in Malaysia last month.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad57da4d0:347dd0:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

NASHVILLE, Tennessee–“We’ve got to get the health care done,” President Donald Trump told an enthusiastic crowd of 8,000 Tennesseans at the beginning of his address to a rally in the Nashville Municipal Auditorium on Monday night.

He turned to the theme of health care toward the very end of his speech.

“The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address,” the president said.

“Let me tell you, we’re going to arbitrate, we’re going to all get together, we’re going to get something done,” he added.

The president also blasted the culture of Washington and Democratic recalcitrance.

“Remember this–if we didn’t do it the way we’re doing it … we need 60 votes. So we have to get the Democrats involved. They won’t vote, no matter what we do,” he said.

“We’re doing it a different way, a complex way, it’s fine. The end result is — when you have Phase One, Phase Two, Phase Three, it’s going to be great,” the president added.

“And then we get on to tax reduction,” he concluded.

While he heaped praise on a number of Tennessee Republican politicians in his speech, another name was noticeable for its absence in his talk: Speaker Paul Ryan.

Ryan’s healthcare reform bill, referred to as Obamacare-Lite by some, has been panned by Democrats and conservatives alike.

The president’s remarks in Nashville on Monday did little to suggest he is committed to the specifics of the Ryan proposal.

In addition to his use of the term “arbitrate” he used another term to describe how he would approach getting a health care bill through Congress: “negotiate.”

While he firmly stood behind his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the president made it clear that the healthcare bill currently on the table may be substantially different from the bill he finally signs.

“The bill I will ultimately sign will repeal and replace Obamacare,” the president told the cheering crowd.

Trump focused more on the failures of Obamacare than the specifics of the current proposals under consideration.

“Remember all of the broken promises? You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan? Remember the wise guy that essentially said … the so-called architect … the American people are stupid?” he asked.

“Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever,” he told the cheering crowd.

Trump also criticized “the level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians” in Washington.

“If we submitted the Democrats’ plan … we wouldn’t get one vote from the Democrats. That’s how much divisiveness and other things there are,” he added.

“But we’re going to get it by,” Trump said of a revised health care bill.

“I’ve talked to so many victims of Obamacare. At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw. The government forcing people to buy a government-approved product,” he added.

Trump said that when health care has been fixed, Americans “will be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad562181e:344f18:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A federal judge in Hawaii says Muslims in America are unfairly and illegally discriminated against by Donald Trump’s effort to curb the immigration of violent Muslim refugees from war-torn Muslim countries.

Another judge in Wisconsin says a Syrian who recently was given asylum — and who is not even a citizen — has the right to ask a fellow judge for visas to fly his relatives into the United States, regardless of opposition from the U.S. government’s border, police and intelligence, and immigration agencies.

Three California judges and a judge in Washington State say the President’s sole right and solemn duty to guard the borders ends when a state suffers financial harm because its universities can’t import more fee-paying customers from restricted countries.

These left-wing judges are competing with each other to throw invented legalistic roadblocks in front of Trump’s legal and proper defense of the nation’s borders, said Hans Von Spakovsky, a former lawyer at the Department of Justice who is now working for the Heritage Foundation.

“I don’t think the [various judges] have any professional shame about it — in fact, they’re being applauded by newspaper editors for actually ignoring the [Congress’] law and [Supreme Court] rulings based on their own personal policy preferences,” he told Breitbart.

The judges’ grab for power, despite the plain text of the Congress’ law and despite prior Supreme Court decisions, “is destructive of the rule of law, which is the entire basis of our Republic,” he said.

“It is a very bad development that threatens our democracy … [and] it looks like it is going to get worse [because] we’re going to have more and more litigation, and it is very clear that the progressive left wants to use the courts to fight way our democracy works,” he said, adding “I think what they doing is very anti-democratic.”

The only fix, he said, is for Trump to aggressively push the Senate to confirm good judges for the 110 empty judicial seats around the nation.

Trump will be aided in this push because the Senate’s former Majority Leader, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, changed the Senate rules to lower the 60-vote thresholds to end filibusters of judicial confirmation debates.

“The Trump administration has to remember that Harry Reid ended the [60-vote] filibuster for judges except for the Supreme Court [so] all they need are 51 votes to get any judge confirmed … They were given a gift by Harry Reid and they need to take it,” he said.

Trump must also disregard the Senate’s traditional “blue slip” process, which gives Senators a quiet veto over nominees to judicial seats in their states. Democrats used that process to push President George W. Bush to nominate progressive judges to Democratic-run states during his eight years in the White House. One of Bush’s “blue slip” progressives judges blocked Trump’s Executive Order in Washington State by declaring that universities and companies can ask judges to override Presidents’ curbs on immigration.

Trump and the GOP Senators “have to override that” blue-slip veto, Spakovsky said.

The judge in Washington State, James Robart, declared Feb. 3 that “the [president’s] executive order adversely effects the State’s residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel. These harms extend to the States by virtue of their roles as parens patriae of the residents living within their borders.”

That judge was backed up by three judges in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who cherry-picked court decisions from domestic cases to declare that the danger of jihadism is less urgent than universities’ foreign revenues:

the University of Washington was in the process of sponsoring three prospective employees from countries covered by the Executive Order for visas; it had made plans for their arrival beginning in February 2017, but they have been unable to enter the United States. The University of Washington also sponsored two medicine and science interns who have been prevented by the Executive Order from coming to the University of Washington … Under the “third party standing” doctrine, these injuries to the state universities give the States standing to assert the rights of the [foreign] students, scholars, and faculty affected by the Executive Order. … the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies. And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination. We need not characterize the public interest more definitely than this; when considered alongside the hardships discussed above, these competing public interests do not justify a stay [upholding Trump’s policy]

The Wisconsin decision was announced March 10 by Judge William Conley of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, who went several steps further by saying an individual, who is not even a citizen, has the right to overrule the president if he or she can get a judge to agree. According to the Wisconsin judge’s order:

Plaintiff is a Sunni Muslim who, after being fully vetted by U.S. immigration authorities, was granted asylum status because of the torture and religious persecution he had suffered in Syria. he thereafter filed derivative asylum petitions to reunite with his wife and his only surviving child….. President Trump’s efforts to impose an immigration ban by executive order are threatening to stop Plaintiff’s derivative asylum petitions in their tracks.

From 2o13 to 2015, government data shows that 25,565 foreigners got asylum status — and according to Judge Conley — the right to bring their families into the United States regardless of Congres’ laws and the policy that an elected president promised to implement if he was democratically voted into the White House.

In Hawaii, Judge Derrick Watson decided that the elected President’s policy of defending Americans from Muslim jihadis who emerged from Muslim culture in Muslim countries might hurt Hawaii’s tourism industry, saying in his order that:

The State points to preliminary data from the Hawaii Tourism Authority, which suggests that during the interval of time that the first Executive Order was in place, the number of visitors to Hawai‘i from the Middle East dropped (data including visitors from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen) … Because there is preliminary evidence that losses of current and future revenue are traceable to the Executive Order, this injury to the State’s proprietary interest also appears sufficient to confer standing.

The judge also opposed the President’s national defense against Islam’s violent doctrines by quoting the Muslim cleric’s testimony about”ethnicity” and children’s worries, saying:

[“My children] are deeply affected by the knowledge that the United States—their own country—would discriminate against individuals who are of the same ethnicity as them, including members of their own family, and who hold the same religious beliefs. They do not fully understand why this is happening, but they feel hurt, confused, and sad.”

Alongside the judges’ escalating and expanding claims of their judicial power over elected presidents, the written law is entirely clear that the written Constitution and the elected Congress give only the elected president and his Senate-confirmed deputies the legal power to accept or deny entry of alien foreigners into the United States. Here’s the relevant statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1182 (f):

(f) Suspension of Entry or Imposition of Restrictions by President Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.

The Supreme Court has accepted and validated this “plenary power” of the elected president. For example, the court declared in its 1950 judgment lawsuit, titled Knauff v. Shaughnessy, that “It is not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by [congressional] law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a given alien.”

In 2015, the Court reasserted that judgment in Kerry v. Din, saying:

The state action of which Din complains is the denial of [spouse] Berashk’s visa application. Naturally, one would expect him—not Din—to bring this suit. But because Berashk is an unadmitted and nonresident alien, he has no right of entry into the United States, and no cause of action to press in furtherance of his claim for admission … So, Din attempts to bring suit on his behalf, alleging that the Government’s denial of her husband’s visa application violated her constitutional rights… In particular, she claims that the Government denied her due process of law when, without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial, it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse. There is no such constitutional right.

And

Here, a long practice of regulating spousal immigration precludes Din’s claim that the denial of Berashk’s visa application has deprived her of a fundamental liberty interest. Although immigration was effectively unregulated prior to 1875, as soon as Congress began legislating in this area it enacted a complicated web of regulations that erected serious impediments to a person’s ability to bring a spouse into the United States… This Court has consistently recognized that these various distinctions are “policy questions entrusted exclusively to the political branches of our Government, and we have no judicial authority to substitute our political judgment for that of the Congress.”

But that case was decided by 5 to 4, with former Justice Antonin Scalia providing the critical fifth vote against the block of four progressives who would have granted foreigners a conditional right to immigrate into the United States, regardless of government or voter preferences. Scalia is dead, and the Senate has yet to vote on his nominated successor, Judge Neil Gorsuch.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad562181e:344f17:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON D.C. – Amaal Alhaaj is visiting the United States to meet with officials at the United Nations and in Washington D.C. to share how she and others in her delegation are suffering under a reign of terror by radical Islamists in her home country.

“I want the American government to give us the space to explain the reality of Libya and what is happening in Libya,” Amaal told Breitbart News.

She and nine of her colleagues came despite the fact — and because of the fact — that their home country is Libya, one of the six countries included in President Donald Trump’s executive order to temporarily halt the entry of certain people from terror-torn states into the U.S.

As part of the National Movement of Libya (NML), made up of women and tribal leaders from that country, the delegation is representative of those who would be able to enter the country under Trump’s immigration policy: people coming to the United States — visitors and refugees alike — who must face strict vetting to ensure the safety of the American people.

In fact, 2,466 refugees from those six countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — have entered the United States since Donald Trump took office, a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. State Department data revealed this week.

“The number of refugees from the six travel-restricted countries represents 32 percent of all refugees who have entered the U.S. since Trump took office,” the Pew report states.

“Among the six countries identified in the order, Syria (5,585), Somalia (4,703) and Iran (1,893) are the leading nationalities of refugees who have entered the U.S. so far in fiscal 2017 (which begins Oct. 1, 2016). A total of 595 refugees from Sudan have entered the U.S. during this time, while 18 refugees are from Yemen and three are from Libya,” the Pew report states.

The Pew report states:

Before entering the U.S., refugees must be approved by the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, a process that includes screening by the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services and other federal agencies. Once approved by the bureau, refugees undergo a health screening, and most also go through cultural orientations prior to entering the U.S. The entire process can take 18 to 24 months.

The Pew report does not include the fact that the refugees screened by the U.S. are those referred to by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) — a process many consider controversial.

The Pew report may intend to reveal that refugees are coming from these six terror-torn counties despite Trump’s efforts to stop them. But, in fact, the new executive order — like the first one issued in January that faced legal challenges — allows waivers on a case-by-case consideration for foreign nationals who want to come to the U.S. to visit or to live.

Those waivers include people like Amaal and the others in her delegation, who are here to seek help in defeating the radical Islamic terrorism that caused her to flee her homeland.

“The tribal and women leaders and their communities have formed a national movement to address the acute need for reconciliation, stability and the prevention of radicalization and violent extremism in rural regions, where tribal governance remains the primary source of authority and security,” the press release announcing Amaal’s delegation’s visit states. “The women leaders are working in collaboration to advance women’s rights in Libya and will bring a powerful perspective to the Libyan peace process.”

“The meetings will present a rare opportunity for Libyan tribal and women leaders to present their unique insights and pursue new ways of overcoming obstacles hindering their nation’s progress toward peace and stability,” the press release said. “Their goal is to open a path to national unity that has been underrepresented in the peace process.”

Amaal’s delegation is sponsored by the Network for Religious and Traditional Peacemakers and the Libya Institute for Advanced Studies, with the support of Finn Church Aid.

Here is the text about waivers in the new travel executive order, which goes into effect on Thursday:</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad562181e:344f16:5d3506ae</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump fumed against a federal judge in Hawaii who blocked his second Executive Order limiting immigration into the United States from six Middle Eastern countries.

“This new order was tailored to the dictates of the Ninth Circuit’s, in my opinion, flawed ruling,” he said. “This is the opinion of many — an unprecedented judicial overreach.”

Trump referred to his second attempt at an executive order as the “watered down” version, vowing to take his case to the Supreme Court if necessary.

“We are going to win,” he said. “We are going to keep our citizens safe.”

Trump admitted that he didn’t want to replace his first executive order in the first place, suggesting that perhaps he would go back to the original.

“The best way to keep foreign terrorists or, as some people would say, in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists, from attacking our country, is to stop them from entering our country in the first place,” he said as the crowd cheered.

The crowd booed the ruling, which Trump said, “makes us look weak.”

Trump made his remarks during a political rally in Nashville, admitting to his fans that he had to be careful about his rhetoric or the “dishonest” media would accuse him of attacking the courts.

He read the text of the prevailing law, which notes that the president can suspend immigration when “he or she” deems it necessary.

“Fortunately it won’t be Hillary-she,” he quipped, prompting a roar of applause from the crowd followed by chants of “Lock her up!”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad4d83780:26d521:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Open borders are the only path to defeating President Donald Trump, a Salon writer claims.

In a piece titled “Everyone’s wrong on immigration: Open borders are the only way to defeat Trump and build a better world”, Salon writer Anis Shivani claims that there is no distinction between a legal and illegal immigrant; immigration law is “racist”; and “open borders are the only way to go.” Shivani adds:

We are in a situation of chaos, breeding technical illegality, because federal regulations have become too complex. Comprehensive immigration reform of any type would make these laws even more cumbersome by drastically curtailing family unification (our quotas, even after the 1965 liberalization, have always been vastly insufficient to the needs) and thus inviting more illegality. I don’t want to rest my case for open borders on the economic justification, but studies in the 1980s noted that world economic output would double if open borders prevailed everywhere, and studies in the 2000s showed even greater gains for the world economy. Americans often compare the nation to a house, arguing that immigrants who enter without inspection or overstay their visas are like robbers whom we have every right to detain and expel. But a country or even a state or a city or a neighborhood is not a house (just as it is simplistic to compare a country’s budget to a household’s). The nation is dynamic and includes all of us. The nation is an abstraction is only as good as the operation of freedom within it. The same is even truer of the world. If the world cannot be put inside a border, then a country trying to do the same is foolish.

The Salon writer also claims that Trump’s border wall is “a fantasy, not a reality” and argues that “national sovereignty” is nothing more than a “knee-jerk” reaction.

When it comes to illegal immigrants who commit crimes, Shivani contends that those individuals should be treated like American-born criminals.

“The only solution to this anomaly is to cease treating immigration violations as crimes and to completely end detention for immigration,” the Salon writer argues. “If an immigrant commits a crime, he or she should be prosecuted under normal laws, as a criminal defendant not as a ‘criminal alien’.”

Shivani also claims that the mere action of deporting illegal immigrants by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) out of the U.S. is one of the “world’s major human rights calamities”:

Countless numbers of immigrants, even legal permanent residents, have been hauled away from their families, their communities, everything they know and love, based on some minor misdemeanor they may have committed decades ago, which has suddenly been reclassified as an “aggravated felony,” and is cause for their deportation to places they have no memory of. Such immigrants do not have the right to be heard by a judge except in a perfunctory manner, with little room for clemency based on individual circumstances. We do not call our immigrant detention facilities concentration camps, but at any given time we have about 34,000 immigrants serving time in prisons far from home, waiting to be deported. Is this any different than the prison regimes of the most brutal governments we have protested?

The right to free speech is made entirely synonymous with the “right to migrate,” which Shivani writes that “If we do not recognize migration as an inviolable human right, and if we do not give up the idea of the wall, we are bound to lose human rights for all of us.”

Shivani likewise champions the idea that in an open borders U.S., American citizenship “ultimately will be so cheapened as to be worth nothing.”

The Salon writer admits that he wants to see a nationwide “sanctuary” system where criminal illegal immigrants are protected from federal immigration law, writing that it would “become a constructive, constitutional, universal concept.”

The immigration issue has defined the rise of Trump, as Americans continue to be on his side.

Some 80 percent of Americans said they disapproved of sanctuary city policies, as Breitbart Texas reported, with 52 percent of voters saying they supported Trump’s border wall plan.

Even when it comes to other immigration issues, like the number of refugees entering the U.S. every year, some 52 percent of likely voters said they supported Trump’s ban on refugees for a few months, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Similarly, a small minority of 30 percent of Americans said foreign worker guest programs, like the H-1B visa, was necessary, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Shivani closes with a mandate for the courts as they continue to hear challenges to the Trump Administration’s policies:

For the courts, as they face the Trump assault, the challenge is clear: Do away with the plenary power doctrine and extend full constitutional rights to immigrants. Rights should depend on personhood not citizenship, as some of our best legal minds have recognized throughout our history.

President Donald Trump honored former President Andrew Jackson, celebrating his 250th birthday by visiting Hermitage, Jackson’s home in Nashville, Tennessee.

“Look what he was able to do, look what he was able to build,” Trump marveled as he told the story of Jackson, who was orphaned as a young boy before fighting in the Revolutionary War.

“Andrew Jackson was a military hero and genius and a beloved president, but he was also a flawed and imperfect man, the product of his time,” Trump said.

Trump told the story of Jackson being captured by the British during the Revolutionary War as a boy and being slashed with a saber when he refused to shine an officer’s boots.

“It was during the revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite,” Trump said. “Does that sound familiar to you?”

“Oh, I know the feeling, Andrew,” Trump smiled as he shook his head.

Trump explained that since the event, Jackson defied elites and authority figures throughout his life.

“Jackson’s victories shook the establishment like an earthquake,” Trump said. He quoted Henry Clay calling Jackson’s victory as president “mortifying” and “sickening.”

“Oh boy, does this sound familiar,” Trump grinned, as the audience laughed loudly.

Trump told the audience that Jackson removed ten percent of the federal workforce, expanded veterans benefits, rooted out corruption, imposed tariffs to protect American workers — something he was also committed to doing.

“Wait till you see what’s happening pretty soon folks,” he said.

The president reminded the spectators that he brought the Andrew Jackson portrait into the Oval Office, adding that he can see the Magnolia tree planted on the South Lawn by Jackson.

“Now we must work in our time … to expand the blessings of America to every citizen in our land and when we do, watch us grow,” Trump said. “We will truly be one nation.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad44e232c:19f426:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A Politico/Morning Consult poll released on Wednesday shows 52 percent of voters approve of President Donald Trump’s job performance, but that statistic is in the second-to-last paragraph of the Politico article about the poll.

The article states:

Public opinion of the new health care proposal is limited thus far, though the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll does show less fervent opposition to the bill than a SurveyMonkey poll of adult Americans released on Tuesday. Similarly, the Politico/Morning Consult survey also shows more positive opinions of the job Trump is doing as president. In the new poll, 52 percent of voters approve of Trump’s job performance, more than the 43 percent who disapprove. But, on balance, most polls show more disapprove than approve of the job Trump is doing.

Politico chose instead for its article, entitled “Poll: Voters Wary of GOP Health Care Bill,” to lead with the divide among voters on approval of the GOP’s American Health Care Act:

Nearly half of voters support the new Republican health care bill but the elements they like best are holdovers from the Affordable Care Act, according to a new Politico/Morning Consult poll. The new survey — conducted in the days following release of the bill by House GOP leaders — underscores the political thicket that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans face in taking on the issue. While Americans are open to the GOP proposal, there is pessimism that rolling back Obamacare will improve quality, price and coverage. Overall, 46 percent of voters approve of the GOP health care proposal, more than the 35 percent who disapprove. Nineteen percent of voters say they don’t have an opinion of the bill. But any support is shallow: Only 4-in-10 voters say they either ‘strongly approve’ or ‘strongly disapprove’ of the bill, with strong disapproval (22 percent) slightly outpacing strong approval (18 percent).

“Given the wave of criticism from both parties following the rollout of the bill, this is a relatively strong starting point for GOP leaders and the White House,” Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult’s co-founder and chief research officer, is quoted as saying in the article. “However, it will be important to track how public opinion stands up as more information is released in the coming weeks.”

The article notes that the poll was conducted before the Congressional Budget Office released its score of the GOP bill, “but voters were already leaning toward doubt that the House GOP bill would increase the number of Americans on the rolls: Only a quarter thought more Americans would have insurance, fewer than the 38 percent who thought fewer Americans would be enrolled.”

The Politico/Morning Consult poll surveyed 1,983 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.

“Morning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy,” the article’s tag states.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad44e232c:19f422:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

So much for the idea that the Federal Reserve will stand in the way of a Trump economic boom.

President Donald Trump’s promises to cut taxes, increase infrastructure spending, and reduce regulatory burdens on businesses have boosted optimism of everyone from CEOs to small businesses to consumers, sent the financial markets soaring, and boosted job creation. But many skeptics view the post-election moves in sentiment and markets as evidence of a “sugar high” and warned that the Fed might undermine Trump’s attempts to spur faster economic growth.

Fed chair Janet Yellen shot that idea down in her press conference on Wednesday.

“We would certainly welcome stronger economic growth in the context of price stability,” Yellen said. “I certainly urge Congress and the administration to consider policies that would boost productivity growth and raise the economy’s so-called ‘speed limit’ or potential grow. I think those would be welcome changes we would like to see.”

The stock market rallied during the press conference.

The Fed has said that it expects the economy to grow at 2.1% this year and next, with growth falling off to 1.9% the following year. Its long term view is that the economy will grow around 1.8%. Some Fed watchers had speculated that the Fed might view this as the maximum sustainable pace, so that any attempts to drive faster growth would generate unwanted levels of inflation. That, in theory, could lead to the Fed raising rates more quickly, counteracting fiscal stimulus created by tax cuts or infrastructure spending.

Yellen also made it clear that the Fed’s current economic projections do not reflect potential tax cuts or other policy changes. That means that even though the economy is performing at or near where the Fed thinks it can with current fiscal policies, changes to those policies could raise the Fed’s expectations for potential non-inflationary growth.

That is a signal from the Fed to Capitol Hill and the White House to proceed with tax cuts and expansionary policies full speed ahead.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad44e232c:19f421:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s broadcast of PBS’ “Washington Week,” Washington Post reporter Ed O’Keefe said of President Trump’s press conferences, “I don’t think any of us here should fault the guy for taking questions from 17 different news organizations. That’s a good thing. We want that.”

O’Keefe said, “I don’t think any of us here should fault the guy for taking questions from 17 different news organizations. That’s a good thing. We want that. But it was different and it was very much a departure from what we’ve seen before. People who work at the White House are exhausted. We know that. Everyone in this town, frankly, I think is a bit exhausted. But this is what he promised. He promised to shake it up. He promised it would be different and chaotic, and it’s certainly been that way.”

A group of Senate critics of the House-led effort to replace Obamacare met with senior White House aides on Tuesday to warn of the bill’s uncertain future in the Senate.

Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee were at the meeting as well as Senators Ben Sasse, Ron Johnson, Pat Toomey, James Risch, and Luther Strange (the Alabama Senator replacing Jeff Sessions).

Senators Paul and Lee have vocally opposed Ryan’s bill, while other senators in the group continue to signal their concerns behind closed doors.

The meeting was described as a “constructive discussion” by a Senate aide, but described the White House as still in “selling mode” on the bill.

Senior White House aides were clear that the bill could not simply be a Obamacare repeal without some kind of replacement element, according to a Senate aide familiar with the details of the meeting.

Some senators were skeptical that Ryan’s bill, as written, could survive the reconciliation process in the Senate, and would require big changes if it passed the House.

“In all likelihood, Majority Leader McConnell will have to totally rewrite the bill,” a Senate aide predicted to Breitbart News.

Some elements of Ryan’s bill — such as the 30% surcharge for failing to maintain insurance coverage, changing insurance regulations, and the effort to defund Planned Parenthood — face a tough hurdle in the Senate because of the Byrd Rule.

The Byrd Rule allows the Senate Parliamentarian to decide what elements of the budget reconciliation bill can be considered “budget related.” But the parliamentarian can be overruled by the Vice President or the Senate majority, a rare occurrence. Some Senators critics believe that if they do act to overrule the parliamentarian, they might as well have a bill that includes more of what conservatives want.

Cruz detailed the process in a Politico op-ed, but many senators would likely be uncomfortable with that option.

Sen. James Lankford said in a statement after the meeting that he wanted the plan to comply with the Senate rules.

“Today’s meeting at the White House focused on the repeal and replacement of Obamacare in a way that provides a smooth transition to lower costs and better coverage options for everyone,” Lankford said in a statement after the meeting. “We also discussed how a replacement plan can comply with complicated, but necessary, Senate rules.”

President Trump was not at the meeting, but Vice President Mike Pence made an appearance. The White House declined to comment on any details of the meeting.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad3c4381b:b9765:513a0cfd</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump met with automaker CEOs and workers in Detroit, promising to work with them to keep more jobs and factories in the United States.

“We’re going to do some wonderful work with you, but you’re going to have to help us with jobs,” Trump told the CEOs during a roundtable meeting.

Trump promised to revisit the Obama-era CAFE milage standards and cut regulations to make it easier for auto companies to bring back jobs.

“We want you to make great cars, but if it takes an extra thimble of fuel, we want you to do it,” Trump said to the CEOs during the meeting. Trump met with over a dozen executives including the CEOs of Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler. Other executives from Hyundai, Volvo, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Kia, and Volkswagen also attended.

The president toured the American Center for Mobility facility which featured eleven vehicle models that were built in the United States. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt also joined Trump on his trip.

After the meeting Trump delivered a speech to a crowd of auto workers, with a backdrop sign that read “Buy American, Hire American.”

“It’s not just a motto, it’s a pledge,” Trump told the applauding crowd. “It’s a pledge to the working people of this country. The era of economic surrender for the United States is over.”

He praised the auto industry CEOs for providing tens of thousands of jobs for American workers.

“The assault on the American auto industry, believe me, is over,” he said during his speech.

He even praised industry leaders from foreign car companies that were building factories and creating jobs in the United States.

“We love them, too,” he said. “Right?”

The president reminded them that he stopped the unfair Transpacific Partnership trade deal, and started working with auto CEOs to bring more jobs back to the United States. He promised to continue fighting to keep manufacturing in the United States.

“No country can long lead the free world if it does not protect its industries and care for its people and protect its borders,” Trump said, vowing to create a new industrial revolution. “America will be respected again.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad3a89b81:9bef5:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily journalist Diana West , author of American Betrayal : The Secret Assault on Our Nation’s Character, responded to CNN”s weird attempt to manufacture a scandal out of something former Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon said to her four years ago.

“This was yet another attempt by CNN to play ‘gotcha,’” West said. “In this case, it was with a 2013 interview that I did on Breitbart News radio with Steve Bannon. It’s about a 30-plus minute interview about American Betrayal – which, in modern parlance, I like to think of as the map of The Swamp, just to give you a general gist of it.”

LISTEN:

She said CNN listened to this entire discussion, which was “a very historical-based, fact-based, and to me quite fascinating discussion I had with Steve,” who was hosting the Breitbart News radio show at the time.

“In the concluding moments, he gives a passing nod to Joseph McCarthy, correctly stating that Joseph McCarthy was right about so much of what he was looking at,” West recalled. “And they write an entire story about that one line, because in their world of not just Fake News but fake history, this is an outrage that is supposed to then engender wails and shrieks and fainting among their friends in Media Land, and be more reason to find Stephen Bannon a frightening character.”

“I’ve been a journalist literally for 30 years now, and what really bothers me, even to this day – I know I should know better about these things given the situation – but what really bothers me is the absolute lack of any sort of professional curiosity, which really should be the basis of anybody going into journalism, right?” she said. “Curiosity, finding out the facts. In order to set that story up, in order to say ‘Why would Steve Bannon say such a thing? That seems outrageous to us!’, let’s look at the facts. Let’s look at that conversation again, 30 minutes of discussion.”

“No, this was just a gotcha story,” she sighed. “It’s desperate, it’s pathetic, but it also becomes another opportunity to get the truth out, which is why I’m so happy we’re having this conversation.”

“It’s a very, very signal part of our history, especially today as people are so fecklessly throwing around this concept of Russian influence, Russian subversion, in the most ignorant terms. Whereas we have a history, certainly including very much in the forefront of that Joseph McCarthy’s history, and many other investigators, many other defectors, many other historians and journalists and so on,” said West.

She found a sinister political purpose in the demonization campaigns directed at anyone who questions the Left’s historical narrative of the McCarthy years.

“The overall effect of this drumbeat, that has not stopped for – oh, my gosh, we’re talking 60-some years or more – it prevents people from taking that important look. It prevents academics from going back and re-reading the records. It prevents people from having the kinds of conversations we’re having right now. That is the purpose, because once you pull the plug on Joseph McCarthy and understand the extent to which America was subverted, our government and institutions were subverted, and you put it together into our general history, which is what I start to do in American Betrayal – there’s much more to do – it overturns our entire conception of ourselves as a nation, and our own history,” West said.

She applauded Breitbart News for spotlighting a story by the late M. Stanton Evans, author of Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight Against America’s Enemies, in which he counted “how many cases that came before McCarthy and his committee had been proven to be indeed assets, agents, ideological Communists inside the federal government.”

“He came up with fifty, and he stopped counting,” West said. “He could have continued, but he stopped at fifty, it’s a nice big number. That’s incredible in such a short career, that was going on in the Senate as McCarthy was being continually investigated himself, one after another investigation. The man was dead at age 48. So we’re looking at an extraordinary person with an extraordinary career. We have not been allowed to reckon with what it means, and what this history means.”

“And then today, when we come across all the Russia news, it’s as if we’re in an alternate universe, because the kinds of charges that are going around, with people being called Russian agents, Russian stooges and so on… Joseph McCarthy would never have made such reckless allegations without evidence,” she said with a laugh.

Marlow referred to Evan’s article to point out that McCarthy had evidence of active Communists rising very high in the federal government, whereas six months of intensive research with vastly more sophisticated Information Age tools has yet to uncover any proof of nefarious Russian influence in the current administration.

“That’s a really important point, in terms of how far up these people were able to rise, and there were so many of them that before World War II was really under way, you had Rep. Martin Dies of the House Un-American Activities Committee – a Democrat from Texas – who was able to put together, using the kinds of Communist front groups that had been identified by the Attorney General as subversive groups, he was able to put together a list of 1,124 federal employees who were members of these Communist front groups,” West noted.

“This was an incredible thing in terms of the fact that on that list, which I actually possess a copy of, there are the names of Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, many other of the most important and dangerous Soviet agents who essentially restyled the world after World War II,” she revealed. “Alger Hiss was the first acting Secretary-General of the United Nations. That was really his baby, this idea of world government. Harry Dexter White headed up the International Monetary Fund. The whole global monetary system was formed under this Communist agent. These were the kinds of people who were identified before they had done their worst treachery.”

“And yet, it was squelched. This is why the title was American Betrayal,” she said of her book. “This was a betrayal of America that was coming out of our government. When we see the Deep State ideas today, these two have been prevalent, and these two have been kind of denied to us, because our history does not go into them, does not allow us to go into them.”

West said the mechanism for this denial tends to be McCarthy.

“If you are afraid of being called a McCarthyite, then you tend not to step on that tripwire and look into this incredibly important part of our history and understand it,” she explained. “There is continuity here that we must understand if we are going to be able to destroy it, destroy that Deep State, the Swamp that we hear so much about. It’s not just a privileged bureaucracy. It’s the place where the secrets lie. I think of the creatures in historical terms – the Swamp creatures are the people who want to keep those secrets hidden from us.”

“They belong to us. These are all government enterprises, government secrets. They belong to the American people, particularly now, as we’re looking 50, 60, 70 years down the line,” she contended. “These things should be broken out of those archives and presented to us, so that we can understand who we are, and what has been done to us. A lot of this really is ugly, ugly treachery against the American people.”

West said she thought part of the animus against Donald Trump was due to the possibility that he might dig into these long-buried secrets.

“It is so important that we get this information out of the darkness and into the light. That’s where you go back to the importance of not allowing yourself to be stopped by this concept of McCarthyism,” she urged.

Marlow noted that public revulsion for “witch hunts” has grown far out of proportion to any careful historical analysis of how much Joseph McCarthy got right or wrong. Witch hunting has become a buzzword that will likely be deployed to thwart any serious investigation of the Deep State, which West described as an “existential threat to the Trump administration.”

She said the Deep State has “a lot to do with what law professor Jonathan Turley has spoken of as an existential threat to the Constitution, in terms of being the ‘fourth branch of government.’”

West went further and drew a comparison between America’s “unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy” and the “old Soviet-style nomenklatura,” who were essential to imposing the will of the socialist state.

“I actually went back to one of my old Soviet history books this week on nomenklatura,” she said. “Low and behold, it was something that was denied in terms of official Soviet government documents or admissions. It was something that was hidden, and people who talked about it were essentially looked at and tried to be marginalized, because this was not something that really existed. Well of course it did, and we’re looking at the same thing here. We’re supposed to not talk about it, and not believe that it exists, but of course it does.”

“In terms of its power, I can’t even begin to overestimate the importance of opening up these kinds of archival secrets, because I think they are the source of the power today of the Deep State, of the manipulation of not just news, but as we were talking earlier, of history,” she said. “Fake history becomes a way of powering that bureaucracy to continue doing what it’s doing. Once you pull out the underpinnings, and once you actually expose what’s going on, I think their foundations get knocked out from under them,” she anticipated.

“It really is incumbent on President Trump to consider this idea of an American Truth Commission that would be designed to bring these papers into the public eye,” West urged. “I’m talking about, for example, 60-year-old FBI documents that have been ‘declassified’ but the redactions, or censoring black lines, are so heavy that you can’t read them. They’re basically unreadable.”

She referenced demands for access to other, more recent documents, including U.S. intelligence about Russian bombings in Chechnya, which helped propel Russian President Vladimir Putin into power.

“Many people have accused him of complicity in those bombings,” West noted. “What does our government know about that? These are the kinds of things that we should know, so that we can make as people sovereign, reasonable, fact-based decisions about the direction of our country. These secrets should not be the purview of unelected, hidden bureaucracies – and this would be, in the case of the CIA, the ultimate in that category.”

She stressed the importance of uncovering these bureaucratic secrets without compromising U.S. intelligence-gathering methods or national security.

“I’m not talking about anything irresponsible, but just simply what we know inside, and what was known long ago inside. That should definitely come out unredacted,” she said of her proposed American Truth Committee.

“These are the kinds of things that give power to the elites, to the establishment, that are absolutely at war with Donald Trump. He’s the only outsider I think we can hope that we will ever have. I don’t think that we’ll ever see his like again, in terms of his outsider status. Only an outsider could do this. Only an outsider could call for this with presidential powers. It’s a golden opportunity that we have, and I hope he considers this,” said West.

Hordes of liberal Twitter users went from giddy anticipation to impotent rage Tuesday night as MSNBC host Rachel Maddow’s big tease of “Trump tax returns” delivered no new evidence of political collusion between the U.S. president and Russia.

Many messages along these lines came from reporters and editors for establishment news outlets — who claim to be objective and non-partisan while pushing a conspiracy believed almost exclusively by the far left.

As the show aired, several journalists complained about Maddow’s torturously long presentation of background info, which allowed the White House and several other news outlets to get ahead of reporter David Cay Johnston’s “scoop” that Trump paid the IRS $38 million in 2005. Others stayed patient with Maddow, tweeting along to her web of Trump-Russia connections.

Philip Gourevitch of The New Yorker expressed hope that these tax returns would clear up “unanswered questions” about “Russian oligarchs”:

Deutsche Bank, Bank of Cypress, Turkey, Flynn, Preet, Russian oligarchs… all unanswered questions ever will be answered by tax returns… — Philip Gourevitch (@PGourevitch) March 15, 2017

Ryan McCarthy, Editor-in-Chief of VICE, linked to an article asking questions about a real estate deal between Trump and a Russian fertilizer magnate:

Here&apos;s one story Maddow mentioned on Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev buying Trump&apos;s mansion https://t.co/RGGd5rFeRM — Ryan McCarthy (@mccarthyryanj) March 15, 2017

Peter Sterne, a reporter for Politico, wrote that Maddow’s monologue would only be relevant if the tax return showed “ties between Trump and foreign governments”:

If 2005 tax return shows ties between Trump &amp; foreign governments, then all this context is relevant. But if not, just seems like innuendo. — Peter Sterne (@petersterne) March 15, 2017

Bill Bishop, Managing Editor of Texas news network KHOU, called the history lesson on Trump and Russia “scary”:

Rachel Maddow is revealing part of the alleged Russian connection to President Trump right now on MSNBC. And it&apos;s scary. #khou #HouNews — The Bishop (@BillBishopKHOU) March 15, 2017

Ken Dilanian, reporter for NBC News, apologetically told critics that Maddow was at least introducing a much wider audience to the Trump-Putin conspiracy theory:

Yes, the windup is insufferable, but millions are now hearing things for the first time about the Russia connections. — Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) March 15, 2017

However, for most viewers, disappointment quickly set in.

Annie Linskey, chief national correspondent for the Boston Globe, spoke for her peers:

Hey @maddow does he owe money to the Russians? All we want to know — Annie Linskey (@AnnieLinskey) March 15, 2017

Spencer Ackerman, reporter for The Guardian, wondered if he was “missing” the implication of Johnston’s scoop:

Am I missing something or does this tax return not speak to anything re Russia, Azerbaijan or any extant foreign-based concern re Trump? — Spencer Ackerman (@attackerman) March 15, 2017

The aforementioned McCarthy acknowledged, minutes after his earlier tweet, that Trump’s 2005 return would not illuminate the mysterious property sale of 2008:

Yup https://t.co/wkc7JPlxWG — Ryan McCarthy (@mccarthyryanj) March 15, 2017

Max Weiss, managing editor of “the No. 1 lifestyle brand in Baltimore metropolitan area,” also seemed let down:

2005 tax returns pretty meaningless in terms of his ties to Russia. — Max Weiss (@maxthegirl) March 15, 2017

As Maddow’s show wrapped up, these purportedly non-partisan journalists began to speculate that President Trump himself leaked the document — since it proved far from scandalous.

Noam Schreiber, New York Times reporter, lamented, “There is basically nothing incriminating here”:

More I think about it, more I believe Trump leaked his own returns. There is basically nothing incriminating here. 1/ — Noam Scheiber (@noamscheiber) March 15, 2017

Still, others maintained hope that the story would move forward, either through other leaked tax returns or through federal investigations.

Carlos Maza of Vox subtweeted Maddow’s detractors, such as Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post:

&quot;I knew the tax returns would be a nothingburger,&quot; he tweeted, not fully understanding how tax returns, audits, or Russia work. — Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) March 15, 2017

Jim Acosta, CNN correspondent, hyped a report about FBI Director Jim Comey potentially announcing a Trump-Russia investigation with a tongue-in-cheek link to the evening’s tax return hoopla:

Psst… More on that 2005 return here… https://t.co/XbPem5ORz1 — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) March 15, 2017

Maggie Haberman, New York Times White House Correspondent, gave a similar preview on the Comey story:

This feels like potentially bigger deal &gt; https://t.co/fxc3VjN4Mo — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) March 15, 2017

A viral tweet from Evan Osnos, writer for The New Yorker, held out hope for a smoking gun in Trump’s 2008 returns:

Time to start looking for &apos;08 tax return. That was the year Don Jr. said they were getting a &quot;disproportionate&quot; share from Russia etc. — Evan Osnos (@eosnos) March 15, 2017

Associated Press national reporter Lisa Lerer, Washington Post “fact checker” Glenn Kessler, and the aforementioned Gourevitch retweeted Osnos’s wish.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad3714ab2:49e8e:1879190</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Look, I’m a “glass is half full” kind of guy. You have to be. I try to stay positive. I try to keep thinking maybe, maybe someday CONGRESS will remember the vision of our Founding Fathers … and that those we elect will represent us, not the special interests.

But Washington politicians are so far gone that the Constitution is not even an afterthought, and their master seems to be whatever industry funds them.

It doesn’t have to be this way. We just had an election about change, about draining the swamp. President Trump promised to be different, and I believe he sincerely wants to be. But he is being taken for a ride through the swamp right now on “Obamacare Lite.”

For four STRAIGHT elections, REPUBLICANS ran on repealing Obamacare, and now “Republican orthodoxy” — I’m told — is keeping insurance subsidies, mandates, taxes, and insurance company bailouts.

That’s not acceptable to me. And it isn’t keeping our promise.

Though I want to believe the glass is half full, I am tempted, very tempted, to smash a glass half full of Obamacare Lite — smash that glass to smithereens!

When did Republicans begin to believe that insurance companies should be put on the dole? That they should be bailed out when any of their customers become sick?

When did Republicans begin to believe that the federal government should force you to pay a penalty to a private insurance company if you can’t afford insurance?

When did Republicans begin to believe that we should levy a special tax penalty on those who choose to buy really good health insurance?

The current Ryan Plan — “Obamacare Lite” — is not about patients. It isn’t about better health care. It isn’t about lowering costs.

It is, plain and simple, about getting more money to the insurance companies and running more of your life from Washington.

I am a career physician. I spent years training and learning to be a doctor. I did it for patients. I don’t give a flip about guaranteeing the profits of insurance companies. And as a Senator, I shouldn’t, either.

But in Washington, somehow, the whole debate seems to be about getting people insurance instead of getting people health care.

Insurance doesn’t equate to health care. Just ask all the Obamacare recipients with $6,000 deductibles.

I’m sick of the insurance companies putting me on hold and telling me to talk to their representative in a foreign country. Screw that.

I’m sick of the government telling me I have to buy their crappy product, and I’m sick of watching us go into more and more debt to do it.

We need a new way, and Obamacare Lite isn’t it.

I want the consumer (aka patient) to be king. I want to empower the patient to get the health care they want at the price they want.

I want to let every American be able to join a co-op to buy their health care. When that happens, the buying power returns to the patients.

Instead of patients having to kiss the boots of insurance company executives, my plan would have insurance executives come on bended knee to the patient.

The patient would be king.

The patient, as part of a large buying group, would be able to negotiate lower prices and a policy where you can’t be dropped or ripped off if you become sick. The patient would be able to purchase exactly the type of coverage that suited her needs, without government mandates telling her what she must buy.

ObamaCare forced every American to purchase a policy that included Pediatric Dental, whether you had children under eighteen or not. Is that freedom of choice? Why should you have to pay for something you cannot use? Good for the insurance industry, but bad for patients.

As a physician and as a patient, I hate Obamacare. Obamacare jacked up insurance rates and created insurance monopolies.

But the answer is not replacing the government mandate with an insurance mandate, which is exactly what Obamacare Lite does.

I don’t feel any less manipulated by being forced to pay the insurance company a penalty instead of the government.

I want the patient to be king. If you want to disrupt the apple cart, if you want to take away the monopoly power of insurance companies, do one thing — allow every individual in America to join a co-op, to join a buying group, to join an association health plan.

The insurance CEOs hate the idea — which should be enough to tell you it might just empower the patient.

So if you hated Obamacare and don’t care much for Ryan’s Obamacare Lite, maybe you ought to consider telling them all to take a hike and give you the option of joining a co-op. Give you the option of buying across state lines. Give you the option of having a YUGE Health Savings Account so you can spend your money how you want. I challenge the media to compare the price of LASIK surgery, contact lenses, and orthodontics in the last twenty years — prices come down when patients make decisions about what they are buying.

While I am a “glass is half full” kind of guy, I also would love to give the middle finger to the man that profits off of government bailouts and forces his or her monopoly Brand of insurance schemes on an often worried and defenseless public.

Just say no to Obamacare, to Obamacare Lite, and to any scheme to enrich the insurance cartel.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad302f985:255550:a17ddb4e</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

An analysis conducted by Bloomberg News found that counties who voted for President Donald Trump—particularly crucial Rust Belt states—would see “less than a third” of the tax relief that counties who voted for Hillary Clinton would under Obamacare 2.0, which would give a financial boost to the winners of globalization.

“Taxpayers in counties that backed Trump would see an annual windfall of about $6.6 billion, a Bloomberg analysis of Internal Revenue Service data shows. In counties that backed Clinton, it’d be about $21.9 billion,” Bloomberg explains, since the tax cuts in Obamacare 2.0, championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, apply to couples earning over $250,000 and individuals earning over $200,000. Blue counties like Manhattan, filled with high-earners, would be able to avoid an additional Medicare tax under Ryan’s plan.

That’s not a surprise. Clinton’s support came from counties where large amounts of money flowed in and out, where the “winners of globalization” clustered, as Christopher Caldwell explained in the Claremont Review of Books:

Any place that has political power becomes a choke-point through which global money streams must pass. Such places are sheltered from globalization’s storms. They tend to grow. Austin, Texas, adds tens of thousands of residents a year, and is now the country’s 11th-largest city. The four richest counties in the United States are all in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Resources are sucked from almost everywhere into political capitals and a few high-tech centers and university towns allied with them, where ambitious people settle and constitute a class. The Democratic Party is the party of that class, the class of the winners of globalization. There are now just three regions of the country in which Democrats dominate—New England, California, and the Pacific Northwest. Otherwise, the party’s support comes from the archipelago of powerful New Economy cities it controls. Washington, D.C., with its 93-to-4 partisan breakdown, is not that unusual. Hillary Clinton won Cambridge, Massachusetts, by 89 to 6 and San Francisco by 86 to 9. Here, where the future of the country is mapped out, the “rest” of the country has become invisible, indecipherable, foreign.

Trump’s sprawling base of support spans across the country: The losers of globalization. As Michael Patrick Leahy reported at Breitbart News shortly after the election: “Donald Trump won an overwhelming 7.5 million popular vote victory in 3,084 of the country’s 3,141 counties or county equivalents in America’s heartland… Hillary Clinton, in contrast, had an 8.2 million vote margin in a narrow band of 52 coastal counties and five ‘county equivalent’ cities stretching from San Diego to Seattle on the West Coast and Northern Virginia to Boston on the East Coast.”

And, Obamacare 2.0 wouldn’t let many Trump voters to keep more of their money. Earlier, the Washington Post reported that Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin will see their tax credits decrease under Obamacare 2.0: “If you’re a 40-year-old making $75,000 a year, you’re going to get a 75 percent or higher increase to your tax credits—a beneficial situation for you. If, however, you’re a 60-year-old making $30,000 a year, you’re going to see a reduction in those tax credits (unless you live in Upstate New York or Massachusetts or parts of central Texas).”

The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that Obamacare 2.0 could cause up to 24 million to lose their health insurance plans by 2026.

Obamacare 2.0 also includes an arbitrary “continuous coverage” provision that inflicts a year-long, 30 percent increase as a penalty on those who go without insurance for more than 63 days. That will take money from middle class voters and put it in the hands of insurance companies. Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz sparked an uproar after he called this wealth transfer “an investment” that voters should make over buying a new iPhone.

Massive wealth disparities and concentrated wealth at the top of society have led to growing political unrest, said Fox News host Tucker Carlson earlier this week.

“But the overview here is that all the wealth, basically, in the last 10 years, has stuck to the top end. That’s one of the reasons we’ve had all the political turmoil, as you know,” Carlson said. “And so, kind of a hard sell to say ‘Yeah, we’re gonna repeal Obamacare, but we’re gonna send more money to the people who’ve already gotten the richest over the last 10 years.’ I mean, that’s what this does, no? I’m not a leftist, it’s just—that’s true.”

“I’m not that concerned about it,” Ryan said. Ryan may not be interested in political upheaval, but it’s interested in him. Passing Obamacare—and the stimulus package—led to the Tea Party revolt in 2010. Enormous Obamacare premium increases revealed in October hurt Clinton’s campaign. Trump is more popular than Ryan in Ryan’s congressional district, while Obamacare 2.0 is unpopular: Only 37 percent support it, while 46 percent oppose it. The rumblings against the bill could cost Ryan his Speakership, or even his Congressional seat while handing power to Democrats.

Still, some voters feel ambivalent towards the tax cuts in Obamacare 2.0 and still support Trump.

“It pisses me off, but my wife pisses me off, too, and we’re still married,” one Trump supporter told Bloomberg.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad2cbbfa4:4fe70c:68f20c6a</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Conversations between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have not resulted in significant benefits for Moscow, prompting frustration in Russia, according to a spokesman for the Kremlin.

“Well, I respect a lot of people but that doesn’t mean I’m going to get along with him,” President Trump recently told Fox News, referring to his Russian counterpart. “He’s a leader of his country. I say it’s better to get along with Russia than not.”

”And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS [Islamic State], which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world, that’s a good thing,” he also said, adding, “Will I get along with him? I have no idea.”

Despite expectations that the election of President Trump would give way to a new era of thawing relations between Cold War foes Russia and the U.S., Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reportedly indicated, “There has been little meaningful communication between Washington and Moscow.”

The Independent noted:

The two leaders are yet to meet face to face, although they had a telephone conversation shortly after Mr. Trump was inaugurated, prompting speculation that three years of tensions between the two countries might be coming to an end. But the phone call was said to have entailed only Mr. Putin offering his congratulations to Mr. Trump followed by a brief discussion on the current state of relations between the former Cold War enemies.

Russia’s expectations that sanctions against the Kremlin imposed for its intervention in Ukraine would be dropped after Trump took office have seemingly turned out to be nothing more than a pipe dream.

“Unfortunately, we don’t have a better understanding of when this dialogue can begin,” Peskov told CNN.

Regarding “high confidence” accusations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia state-sponsored hacking has interfered with the election of Trump, the Kremlin spokesman said, “What we have seen — an open, a public part — of a report by one of the agencies, special agencies of the United States. And I would humbly say that it’s not a paper of high quality, in terms of being really trustful.”

President Trump has not directly criticized his Russian counterpart.

“If the two presidents are able to establish a rapport, it could pave the way for deals on Ukraine and Syria, the two major sources of friction between their countries during the administration of Barack Obama after Putin backed Assad in Syria, annexed Crimea and invaded Ukraine,” reported the Independent.

“Both leaders have spoken about ending the enmity that has dragged US-Russia relations to their lowest ebb since the Cold War,” it adds.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad2cbbfa4:4fe704:68f20c6a</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who is now a top economic advisor to President Trump and the director of the National Economic Council, has emerged as a spokesman for the Trump administration, making the pitch for the GOP healthcare plan and the Federal Reserve.

Cohn was front and center with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, defending the Paul Ryan-pushed healthcare plan that critics like Sen. Rand Paul are calling “Obamacare Light.” Cohn advanced the same argument that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has been making. As The Hill reported:

Republicans are demanding changes to the current ObamaCare repeal and replacement plan. Some demands include an end to the expansion of Medicaid by 2018 instead of 2020, and the removal of insurance mandates that provide certain benefits such as maternity care. Cohn on Sunday also defended the bill, saying it provides Americans with health insurance coverage. “We believe if you want to have coverage, and we believe everyone should have coverage, we’re providing you access to coverage,” Cohn added.

As Reuters reports, Cohn also praised the Federal Reserve, who is expected to raise interest rates later this week:

“The Federal Reserve is an independent agency and they operate as such. They have their economic data, which they look at and they are trying to always modulate economic growth with inflation, with the work force,” Cohn said. “I think the Federal Reserve has been doing a good job in doing that. The Fed will do what they need to do. And we respect the powers of the Fed.”

As Breitbart News reported, Cohn was responsible for appointing Andrew Quinn — the chief negotiator and public advocate for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) — as President Trump’s new special assistant on international trade, investment, and development for the National Economic Council.

Cohn appointee Quinn was originally brought into the Obama White House in 2012, where he not only negotiated for the TPP but also defended the controversial trade proposal vigorously and publicly.

Cohn himself is a Wall Street insider who started advising Trump during the campaign. As the New York Times has reported, on his exit from Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn was festooned with “expedited access to cash and stock payments valued at nearly $300 million” as Cohn and family members got ownership of 940,908 shares of Goldman stock with a value of nearly $220 million plus a cash payout of about $65 million.

The Times of Israel reports: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday evening that talks with US President Donald Trump’s Mideast peace envoy, Jason Greenblatt, did not yield an agreement for a coordinated US-Israeli position on West Bank settlements, but described the meeting as “good” and “honest.”

“I have to say that I had good conversations, in-depth ones. I can’t say we finished or came to an agreement,” he told reporters at a press conference. “We’re in a process, but it’s a process of mutual dialogue, authentic and honest in the positive sense,” Netanyahu said. That process, he added, is “not yet visible to media.”

Netanyahu and Greenblatt met for over five hours on Monday. During the meeting, Trump’s public appeal to the prime minister to rein in settlement building was raised.

Media outlets are reporting that President Donald Trump has given the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) broader power to use drones to attack radical Islamic terrorists on the battlefield.

The Wall Street Journal cited U.S. officials as its source for the report on the CIA stepping up its role in U.S. drone warfare.

“The move would be a change from the policy of former President Barack Obama’s administration of limiting the CIA’s paramilitary role,” the article posted by the Wall Street Journal and picked up by other media outlets said.

“The United States was the first to use unmanned aircraft fitted with missiles to kill militant suspects in the years after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington,” the report said. “Strikes by missile-armed Predator and Reaper drones against oversea targets began under former President George W. Bush and were expanded by Obama.”

The report said some oppose the use of drones because the attacks can be used by jihadist groups to recruit people to their cause. And in July the U.S. government accepted responsibility for inadvertently killing up to 116 civilians in drone strikes in countries where America is not at war.

A 2012 article in The Nation revealed that the CIA’s relationship with drone warfare dates back almost two decades, however.

“The CIA had been flying unarmed drones over Afghanistan since 2000,” The Nation article read. It went on to say:

It began to fly armed drones after the September 11 attacks. Some were used during the air war against the Taliban in late 2001. But by February 2002 the CIA hadn’t yet used a drone for a strike outside military support. The February 2002 attack was a pure CIA kill operation, undertaken separately from any ongoing military operation. The drone operators were reported to have come across three people at a former mujahedeen base called Zhawar Kili—later, officials would never claim they were armed—including a “tall man” to whom the other men were ‘acting with reverence.’ (On one previous occasion, a year before the September 11 attacks, CIA observers thought they’d seen bin Laden: a tall man with long robes near Tarnak Farm, bin Laden’s erstwhile home near Kandahar. This sighting by an unarmed drone was what had led to the first arguments among the White House and CIA about arming drones with missiles, a debate that simmered until it was snuffed out by the September 11 attacks.

The U.S. is not alone in using the drone on the battlefield, including the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).

In January, the Pentagon confirmed that the Islamic State has used makeshift “drones” against coalition forces in Mosul, affixing “grenade-like” explosives to commercial-quality aerial drones and using them to attack enemies from afar.

“As we’ve made our way into Mosul now, what we’ve seen is that they use the smaller drones… they’re up for, you know, 45 minutes, an hour so, and even that evolution has transitioned in the beginning of the Mosul campaign from — from just reconnaissance to they are actually putting munitions in them,” Col. Brett Sylvia, head of the U.S. Task Force Strike in Mosul, told reporters.

“I can tell you it has resulted in the damage to some equipment and damage of some structures as well as to some civilian casualties because,” he noted, the Islamic State is “not concerned about whether or not any of the civilians in Mosul are killed or wounded.”

“I am aware that ISIL has used commercial-off-the-shelf UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] to drop small explosive weapons,” Air Force Col. John Dorrian, a top U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, told the Washington Times.

But, he said: “This capability is dangerous and has propaganda value, but it will not change the fact that the enemy is being defeated in both Iraq and Syria.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad2948c55:4a3eb7:68f20c6a</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A national security expert and professor at Liberty University tells Breitbart News that, during his recent visit to war-ravaged Iraq, he found many Christians and Muslim Kurds who “openly” expressed their support for U.S. President Donald Trump as a form of protest against radical Islam and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).

“They see Trump as someone who is unconventional and therefore, won’t be bound by conventional limitations in fighting ISIS and the Iranian regime,” Ryan Mauro, a national security analyst at the Clarion Project and professor of counterterrorism at Liberty University, told Breitbart News. “The Kurds, the Kakai Kurdish minority, and the Christians directly and passionately asked me to relay a request to President Trump: for him to personally come visit with them and for the U.S. to provide political and military support. A safe zone for the persecuted minorities should immediately become an official objective of U.S. policy.”

“I was surprised by how openly pro-Trump many Christians and Muslim Kurds I met with were, and they expressed their support without me even asking the question. For them, the issue is standing up against radical Islam, of which ISIS is the deadliest manifestation right now,” he added.

Representatives from Iraq’s ethnoreligious minority community, including the Christians, Yazidis, Shiite Turkmen, and Shabak, have recently joined forces to urge the Iraqi government and the international community to allow them to form a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq’s Nineveh Plain, once home to the largest concentration of minority group’s in the country.

Mauro learned from local Iraqi Christians that they would like “financial support and manpower” to support local Christian security units that would protect Christian lands in an established safe zone in the Nineveh Plain for all persecuted minorities.

Moreover, the professor noted that some Kurds also expressed acceptance of a safe-zone for Iraqi minority groups such as the Christians so long as the U.S. and international community allowed them to declare their region as an independent Kurdistan.

“I do see a future for the Christian community in Iraq, because they, after all, they’ve been through, see a future,” Mauro told Breitbart News. “The ones who I walked around Qaraqosh [once the largest Christian city of Iraq] with were adamant that their faith is even stronger than it was before and vowed to reopen the burned church and fill it with an even bigger crowd than before.”

“To them, God will use this hell they’ve endured to perform a miracle. They emphasized that ISIS’ urge to destroy Christian buildings was a sign of weakness and fear; insecurity about their own faith as if Islam, or at least ISIS’ version of it, can only survive by wiping out competitors,” he added. “On a few occasions, I heard the line, ‘We don’t worship a God of buildings. Our God is in here,’ while pointing towards their hearts.”

Professor Mauro noted that what keeps Christians, Kurds, and other ethnoreligious minority groups in Iraq awake at night is not a “falsely-described ‘Muslim ban,’” but rather what they can do in the moment to enjoy as much secular-democratic freedom as possible without being decapitated.

“Their primary concern is: not being beheaded and having whatever secular-democratic freedom is possible, so controversies we’re fixed on like the falsely-described ‘Muslim ban’ is of little consequence to them,” he continued.

The restrictions Mauro refers to are part of President Trump’s executive order limiting immigration into the United States from terrorism-linked countries to keep America safe.

Various leaders from the Christian minority and Kurdish communities in the Middle East praised Trump on winning the U.S. presidency in November, saying they are hopeful the new American leader will strengthen and support ethnoreligious minority groups across the Middle East, victims of the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).

While campaigning for president, Trump, who identifies as a Presbyterian, vowed to defend Christians across the world.

“They’ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible,” President Trump told the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in January. “And the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad278dd94:14f6c7:2b59ac16</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Former President Barack Obama tried to pay a quiet visit to Silicon Valley in the late afternoon on Sunday as a private citizen to meet with tech leaders, perhaps to consider his future options.

The San Jose Business Journal speculated that after having lunch in Omaha, Nebraska with multi-billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Obama was trying to make a stealth visit to Silicon Valley to begin the next chapter of his life as a tech player.

Tech confidants had arrived for what Obama had probably intended to be a covert meeting at the Fairmont Hotel in downtown San Jose. But the combination of Secret Service agents, bomb-sniffing dogs, and the former president’s motorcade of SUVs tipped off the media, according to NBC Bay Area.

Breitbart News has reported in the past that Silicon Valley tech was almost as financially important as Wall Street to Barack Obama’s fundraising efforts. Tech donated a record $64.1 million in the 2012 Presidential cycle, up from $17.8 million in 2008, according to OpenSecrets.org. The non-partisan campaign trackers commented: “Tech stepped up to help fill the void — expanding an already significant presence in Obama’s fundraising portfolio from 2008.”

According to the New York Times, many of the former president’s key advisors are now important players in the Left Coast’s tech scene. Obama’s 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, is at Uber; his former press secretary, Jay Carney, is at Amazon; his former communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, is at GoFundMe; and his EPA director, Lisa Jackson, is at Apple. The Times has also documented 10 trips by the representatives of the Obama Foundation to Silicon Valley.

While still in office and just before the election, President Obama guest-edited the November edition of virally popular Wired magazine. In a personal message, Obama claimed that America is living in is greatest time in history. But Obama may have foreshadowed his future when he added, “I still believe science and technology is the warp drive that accelerates that kind of change for everybody.”

The ex-president is only 55 years old and continues to be very popular. According to the 2017 WalletHub Tax Survey, taxpayers rate former president Barack Obama as their most popular public figure, with 56 percent approval. That was 6 percent better than Pope Francis and substantially higher than the 30 percent for President Trump as the third most popular public figure.

Obama’s editorial in Wired claimed that there are important challenges ahead for our society such as climate change, economic inequality, cybersecurity, terrorism and gun violence. The President claimed that to resolve these issues, “we need science.”

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro – the man who reduced his people to giving away their children to avoid starvation – promises there will be “surprises” in his relationship with “Comrade Trump,” whom he lauded for offering Venezuela food “at a good price.”

“We are bringing products imported by the revolutionary government from several sister nations: Trinidad and Tobago, Panama, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua… and even the United States. Comrade Trump is offering me [basic food products] at a good price. There are going to be surprises,” Maduro said on his weekly TV show, as reported by Fox News. The Washington Examiner notes that Maduro’s weekly television program, Domingos con Maduro, is four hours long. Maduro also hosts a semi-regular radio broadcast titled Salsa Time.

Maduro previously fretted that “bandits” from the Venezuelan opposition flew to Washington to “put a bug in Trump’s ear,” hoping to push him into “the same hole the Bush clan and the Obama-Clinton clan fell into.”

He has also worried that “imperialism” was still lurking out there, waiting to pounce on his socialist paradise, but he warned imperialists they will find Venezuelans “stronger than ever.” He might be hoping imperialism will not notice all the Venezuelans collapsing from hunger as they wait in the glorious socialist food lines.

Fox News notes President Trump’s only significant action on Venezuela has been ordering sanctions against Vice President Tareck El Aissami for participating in the cocaine trade. In February, the U.S. government declared Aissami “played a significant role in international narcotics trafficking” and froze his access to a $3 billion fortune.

The Miami Herald reports that El Aissami has also been linked to radical Islamic organizations, including Lebanese Hezbollah. “He is one of Venezuela’s main contacts with Hezbollah. He has been providing logistical and financial support to those organizations,” Luis Fleischman of the Center for Security Policy told the Herald.

The paper also cited a report from the Center for a Secure Free Society that alleged Aissami “developed a sophisticated and multilevel financial network that functions as a criminal terrorist pipeline for bringing Islamic radicals to Venezuela and its neighbors, and to send illegal funds from Latin America to the Middle East.”

Aissami, a former governor, was hand-picked by Maduro to be vice president and widely seen as his aspiring successor. His blacklisting by the Treasury Department was described by the New York Times as the “first salvo against the Maduro government by the Trump administration at the urging of many in Congress.”

Maduro responded to the action against Aissami by vowing to “respond, step by step, with balance and force,” with the goal of forcing the United States to “retract and apologize publicly to our vice president.”

Aissami himself said the U.S. accusations were “infamy and aggression,” promising not to be distracted from fixing Venezuela’s economy by such “miserable provocations.” The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry accused the Trump administration of trying to undermine the government with its “infamy against the highest authority of the state.”

The Daily Signal notices that Trump also recently tweeted support for political prisoner Leopoldo Lopez and demanded his immediate release. Lopez was thrown in prison three years ago by Nicolas Maduro, for the crime of severely disapproving of Nicolas Maduro. He is currently serving a 14-year sentence.

Maduro’s new bonhomie towards “Comrade Trump” would, therefore, seem like a dramatic shift in attitude after just a few weeks. He seems to be working hard on creating a narrative where Trump can be his friend, provided he ignores all the nasty lies those opposition “bandits” seek to fill his ears with.

The Daily Signal applauds Trump for taking a stronger stance against Venezuela’s corrupt leadership than Barack Obama ever did and advises him to stay his course:

The Obama administration knew full well that the Venezuelan vice president is a criminal, but it took no strong action. Yet within the first month of Trump’s administration, El Aissami’s illicitly obtained assets in the U.S. were confiscated. The Trump administration’s clear position on Venezuela is a welcomed change from the moral ambiguity of his predecessor. Moving forward, the administration must continue holding the Venezuelan government accountable in the hopes of bringing political freedom to the Venezuelan people.

The Miami Herald points out that at least 511 companies are wholly or majority-owned by the Venezuelan government — a stunning level of state ownership even when compared to much larger countries in the region — and 70 percent of them are losing money. The combined losses of these companies in 2016 were substantially higher than what the government allocated for education, health, housing, and social security.

Despite these staggering losses, Venezuela’s state-run enterprises have been hiring people at a staggering clip, and Maduro is threatening to nationalize even more companies. Just last weekend, he decided industrial bakeries were responsible for Venezuelan starvation and talked about seizing them, as he does with every enterprise he accuses of waging “economic war” against his regime. This is not a government President Trump wants to support in any way, and he does not need Nicolas Maduro claiming him as a “comrade.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad278dd94:14f6be:2b59ac16</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump argued that there was a cultural double standard, after rapper Snoop Dogg released a video of him pulling a gun on a man in clown makeup who looked like Donald Trump.

“Can you imagine what the outcry would be if Snoop Dogg, failing career and all, had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama?” Trump marveled in a message on Twitter. “Jail time!”

Sen. Ted Cruz also responded to the video. “Snoop owes the president an apology,” he said when asked about the video by a TMZ cameraman. “There’s absolutely nothing funny about an assassination attempt on a president.”

Sen. Marco Rubio criticized the video as well, suggesting that it could give a mentally unstable person the wrong idea idea.

“We’ve had presidents assassinated before in this country, so anything like that is really something we should be very careful about,” he told TMZ.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad2264341:d3de2:a17ddb4e</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Tuesday’s broadcast of “CNN Tonight,” former Clinton Press Secretary Brian Fallon stated, “I don’t think we learned anything at all interesting” from MSNBC’s report on part of President Trump’s 2005 tax return.

Dems should return focus to Trumpcare tomorrow &amp; the millions it will leave uninsured, not get distracted by two pages from &apos;05 tax return — Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) March 15, 2017

Fallon said, “I never could have predicted I’d coming on your show tonight, Don, and throwing cold water on a report about Donald Trump’s tax returns, but I don’t think we learned anything at all interesting tonight.”

He added that Trump “owes the public the full release of all his tax returns. I think that’s the only way we’ll ever get to the bottom of all his financial holdings and any connections he may have to Russia.”

Fallon concluded Democrats should keep their focus on criticisms of the American Health Care Act, and the tax story “would be a mistake for Democrats to be distracted by.”

On Tuesday’s broadcast of “CNN Tonight,” CNN Money Correspondent Cristina Alesci said that MSNBC’s story on part of President Trump’s 2005 tax return resulted in a headline that is “pretty positive” for the president because it shows “he made a decent amount of money,” and “paid taxes in 2005.”

Alesci said, “[T]he bottom line is, the headline is pretty positive for Trump. Looks like he made a decent amount of money, putting to bed any rumors or myths that he’s not a successful businessman. And he paid taxes in 2005. So, it seems like a positive outcome for him.”

A controversial music video by Snoop Dogg released Monday appears to contradict the years of advocacy work the rapper has done on behalf of gun control.

The video for the song “Lavender” shows Snoop Dogg aiming a pistol at a parody clown version of President Trump, and then pulling the trigger. In an interview with Billboard, the rapper said he felt that other artists weren’t “dealing with the real issue with this f*cking clown as president.”

However, the rapper has in recent years been an outspoken advocate for citizens to disarm themselves and seek peace.

In 2013, Snoop Dogg (then Snoop Lion) launched a social media campaign titled #NoGunsAllowed with former NFL great Joe Montana.

Snoop Dogg explained his motivation for pursuing gun control at the time, saying: “As I hear more and more stories in the news about violent acts of terror and school shootings that leave innocent kids dead, it makes me upset to live in a world full of negativity.”

He continued:

From my new album Reincarnated, the song “No Guns Allowed” is a call to action for people everywhere to come together and help end the senseless gun violence that claims lives every day. I’m not saying I’m against guns, but I’m saying that people need to think about their actions and be responsible for them, ya dig?! A lot of the people pullin’ the trigger haven’t lived long enough to experience a long life full of love, but I know there’s still time for them to walk in the path of peace.

In 2015, Rolling Stone reported that the rapper went as far as to ask fans to go through their 401k accounts and divest of investments in gun companies. This was part of the #IamUnloading campaign.

In July, Snoop co-hosted a press conference at LAPD headquarters with fellow rapper The Game, Police Chief Charlie Beck and L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti in solidarity with both police and civilian victims of gun violence.

In his interview with Billboard, Snoop cited police violence and Trump’s election victory as inspiration for the controversial “Lavender” video.

“The ban that this motherf*cker tried to put up; him winning the presidency; police being able to kill motherf*ckers and get away with it; people being in jail for weed for 20, 30 years and motherf*ckers that’s not black on the streets making money off of it,” he said.

“It’s a lot of clown sh-t going on that we could just sit and talk on the phone all day about, but it’s a few issues that we really wanted to lock into [for the video] like police, the president and just life in general,” he added.

Multiple news outlets have confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Asia and Australia next month. He is expected to visit Japan, China, and Indonesia, among other stops.

A “senior administration official” told CNN that South Korea is also on his itinerary.

Pence’s visit will follow the first international trip by a President Trump cabinet official – Defense Secretary James Mattis’s stops in Japan and South Korea last month – as well as a scheduled trip by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, expected to take place this week.

CNN reports that in Tokyo, Pence plans to discuss “ways to strengthen the economy in Japan and the United States.” Reports of a scheduled visit to Japan have circulated in Japanese media for weeks, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, following his visit to Washington in February, reportedly agreed to host Pence. Earlier this month, Japan’s Kyodo News reported that Pence would likely spend April 17-18 in Tokyo and hold economic talks with Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso. “We will be discussing a wide range of issues, such as strengthening trade and investment ties as well as economic cooperation,” Aso told reporters at the time.

The Japanese government is also hoping to have President Donald Trump visit by the end of this year. “We want him to visit Japan as soon as possible,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in mid-February.

In Indonesia, Reuters reports that Pence will meet with President Joko Widodo and likely “discuss terrorism and other security issues.” The U.S. embassy in Jakarta held a press conference after a meeting on Monday between Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto and Ambassador Joseph R. Donovan on Monday.

“We discussed the planned visit of U.S. [V]ice [P]resident Mike Pence to Indonesia and the strategic problems that can be on the agenda to discuss with our president,” Wiranto told reporters.

Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim country and home to a burgeoning radical Islamic movement. Islamic clerics have banned most celebrations associated with Christmas and Valentine’s Day, yet both holidays still attract large mobs of angry anti-Christian protesters. The governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, is currently on trial for blasphemy after quoting a paragraph from the Quran as an ethnic Chinese Christian.

Pence was reportedly invited to Australia following a visit to the United States by Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop; the content of any discussions in Canberra have yet to be revealed, though both nations have a vested interest in curbing Chinese military expansion in the South China Sea, a matter of grave concern in Australia.

Likewise, details of what Pence will discuss in South Korea and China have not surfaced, though both are struggling to contain a common threat: North Korea. Once a reliable ally, China has retracted much of its support for Pyongyang, cutting its economic ties to the Kim regime significantly since the murder of Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-un’s half-brother. Joint South Korean-American military exercises are currently underway, infuriating Pyongyang and leaving much for Pence and the interim South Korean administration to discuss following the ouster of President Park Geun-hye.

Many of these same concerns will follow Secretary of State Tillerson upon his arrival to Asia this week. Tillerson is scheduled to arrive in Japan on Wednesday, South Korea on Friday, and China on Saturday, according to the Diplomat. The outlet notes that Tillerson will likely meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn, and possibly President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Xi has reportedly also agreed to a meeting with President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in the near future.

The visits “will allow Secretary Tillerson to engage allies and partners, on not only on a range of bilateral issues, but also importantly to discuss and coordinate strategy to address the advancing nuclear missile threat from North Korea,” according to Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the U.S. Department of State.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has refused to be forthcoming on details of Tillerson’s visit. Speaking to reporters on Monday, spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, “You are all very interested in the specific arrangement and agenda of Secretary Tillerson’s visit to China. We will release relevant information in due course.” Tillerson has made public remarks condemning China’s militarization of South China Sea territories it does not legally control.

In Japan and South Korea, Tillerson will be building on the progress Defense Secretary James Mattis made in boosting bilateral ties with both nations. While in Japan, Mattis warned the Chinese government not to attempt to colonize Japan’s Senkaku Islands, which China claims as its own, while stating the Trump administration stands “firmly, 100 percent, shoulder-to-shoulder with you [PM Abe] and (the) Japanese people.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad0362933:c3ae0:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A website claiming to show President Donald Trump’s tax returns crashed Tuesday night as MSNBC host Rachel Maddow revealed details of the documents live on-air.

The website dcreport.org crashed at around 9:00 P.M. EST, while Maddow was rambling on about the content of Trump’s tax returns.

Less than an hour before Maddow’s show began, the dcreports.org Twitter account teased that the tax returns would be part of a “breaking” news report presented by Daily Beast columnist David Cay Johnston.

“#BREAKING We have a Trump tax return . @DavidCayJ will be on @maddow @MSNBC at 9pm &amp; @Lawrence at 10pm EST to discuss it,” dcreports.org tweeted.

#BREAKING We have a Trump tax return . @DavidCayJ will be on @maddow @MSNBC at 9pm &amp; @Lawrence at 10pm EST to discuss it — DCReport (@DCReportMedia) March 15, 2017

Moments later, the outlet sent another tweet apologizing for the site being down.

“Apologies! Site crashed due to traffic from @maddow @MSNBC @Lawrence #TrumpTaxReturns. Trying to fix it ASAP. Be patient, please &amp; thanks,” dcreports.org tweeted.

Maddow took to social media earlier Tuesday to tease that she had gained access to President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

“BREAKING: We’ve got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. (Seriously).” Maddow tweeted.

But moments later, the White House scooped Maddow and revealed the details of Trump’s 2005 taxes. Maddow was also mercilessly mocked on social media.

Small business optimism, which soared following Donald Trump’s election day victory, remains near the highest levels recorded in nearly half a century.

The Index of Small Business Optimism declined slightly in February to hit 105.3, sustaining the surge in optimism that began November 9, 2016, the day after the election, the National Federation of Independent Businesses said Tuesday.

“The Index fell 0.6 points in February to 105.3 yet remains a very high reading. The slight decline follows the largest month-over-month increase in the survey’s history in December and another uptick in January,” the NFIB said in a statement. It noted that this is one of the highest readings for small business optimism in 43 years.

While the post-election optimism hasn’t faded, it has not yet translated into an increase in small business spending and hiring. Many small businesses may be waiting to see if the Trump administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill act on promises to cut taxes, reverse the regulatory expansion of the Obama administration and repeal Obamacare.

“It is clear from our data that optimism skyrocketed after the election because small business owners anticipated a change in policy,” said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan in a statement. “The sustainability of this surge and whether it will lead to actual economic growth depends on Washington’s ability to deliver on the agenda that small business voted for in November. If the health care and tax policy discussions continue without action, optimism will fade.”

Sixty-two percent of small businesses survey reported capital outlays, up 3 points and the second highest reading since 2007. While impressive by post-Great Recession standards, 63 percent is still weaker than historically normal levels. In short, businesses aren’t yet making capital investments in line with their reported optimism.

“Reports of actual outlays appear to be trending up, but still remain well below those observed in ‘good times.’ Growth takes more than optimism, it takes more spending, at least rising to historically normal levels,” the NFIB said.

In short, the Trump economic expansion isn’t inevitable. Too much delay in implementing the agenda could undermine the great boom in optimism produced by President Trump’s election.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ad01aa316:b0e55:68f20c6a</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Hardball,” anchor Chris Matthews stated that President Trump isn’t releasing his tax returns “because there’s a lot in there he doesn’t want us to know, like how about not paying taxes?”

Matthews said, “President Trump wouldn’t release his tax returns during his campaign, but political pressure’s building for the president to just that, at least turn it over to the Intelligence Committee so they can look at it. We’re going to talk about that, and a lot more in ‘Hardball.’ By the way, he’s not going to give away those tax returns. We can pound on that door, and pound on that door, and he ain’t giving them away, because there’s a lot in there he doesn’t want us to know, like how about not paying taxes?”

As President Donald Trump plans a slew of policies that could dismantle key parts of Barack Obama’s presidential legacy, the former president seems to be returning to his roots as a Saul Alinsky-style radical community organizer.

This time Obama and his associates’ objective is to stop Trump’s domestic and foreign policy agendas on virtually all fronts – immigration reform, border security, the roll back of the controversial Obamacare system and more. According to some accounts, Obama and his associates may be seeking no less than Trump’s impeachment.

The strategies for disruption seem to include everything from nonprofit front-group activism and the filing of legal motions to support for protest movements targeting Trump and top administration officials.

This as Trump works to secure America’s porous borders, fix the faltering economy, replace Obama’s largely failed healthcare law, combat the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism, contend with the threat of Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran, and address the issue of illegal immigration that was put on steroids during Obama’s two terms in office.

The latest sign of Obama’s fingerprints on Trump disruption plots comes from reports on Monday that former Obama administration staffers have formed a group to closely monitor the Trump administration.

FoxNews.com reported:

Known as American Oversight, the group will search for anything that seems amiss, whether it touches on ethics or fraud, among other potential problems, the group’s executive director, Austin Evers, told Fox News.

“We are conducting oversight because Congress won’t,” said Evers, who was a State Department lawyer in the Obama administration. “We are using tools available to American citizens to investigate instances of fraud, corruption, violation of ethics rules, you name it. If there’s something that Congress should be investigating, we will be.”

Earlier this month, the Daily Mail reported that Obama’s top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, has moved into Obama’s multi-million dollar rental home in the nation’s capital. The newspaper claimed Obama is turning his home “into the nerve center of the mounting insurgency against” Trump.

“Obama’s goal, according to a close family friend, is to oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing his resignation or through his impeachment,” reported the Daily Mail.

Evidence of Obama’s close associations with efforts to oppose Trump emerged two weeks ago when a group of former top lawyers for the Obama administration formed their own organization aimed at utilizing legal advocacy methods to target Trump’s policies.

That organization is calling itself United to Protect Democracy, drawing on the theme of Obama’s farewell speech last month.

The legal activist group is already partnered with an organization heavily financed by billionaire George Soros and is led by a former Obama lawyer who previously worked at a Soros-financed global activist outfit, this reporter documented.

Then there is also evidence of Obama-connected support for protests targeting Trump.

Last month, it was reported that Organizing for Action, the activist group that emerged from Obama’s first presidential campaign, has partnered with the newly-formed Indivisible Project for “online trainings” on how to protest Trump’s agenda. One week earlier, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.

Organizing for Action (OFA) is a so-called community organizing project that sprung from Obama’s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as “advocat[ing] for the president’s policies.”

Last month, NBC News reported on OFA’s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible:

OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obama’s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania – the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare – and a deputy campaign manager. …

OFA says more than 1,800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a six-week training program, two-thirds of whom have not previously been involved with OFA.

And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25,000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said.

Writing at the New York Post, researcher and reporter Paul Sperry charged that Obama “is intimately involved in OFA operations and even tweets from the group’s account. In fact, he gave marching orders to OFA foot soldiers following Trump’s upset victory.”

Sperry was referring to comments Obama reportedly made in a November conference call with so-called grassroots supporters, telling them “Now is the time for some organizing.”

Obama hinted he will return to community organizing, stating: “I promise you that next year Michelle and I are going to be right there with you, and the clouds are going to start parting and the sun is going to come back out, and we’re going to be busy, involved in the amazing stuff that we’ve been doing all these years before.”

Perry further reported on OFA:

In what’s shaping up to be a highly unusual post-presidency, Obama isn’t just staying behind in Washington. He’s working behind the scenes to set up what will effectively be a shadow government to not only protect his threatened legacy, but to sabotage the incoming administration and its popular “America First” agenda.

He’s doing it through a network of leftist nonprofits led by Organizing for Action. Normally you’d expect an organization set up to support a politician and his agenda to close up shop after that candidate leaves office, but not Obama’s OFA. Rather, it’s gearing up for battle, with a growing war chest and more than 250 offices across the country.

Meanwhile, Politico recently profiled the OFA-affiliated Indivisible, reporting the group has been aided by MoveOn.org and the ACLU .

The associations between the OFA-affiliated Indivisible and the Soros-financed MoveOn.org and ACLU may be telling since the latter two groups have been central to recent efforts to stop Trump.

Two weeks ago, within hours of reports surfacing that Attorney General Jeff Sessions held two conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. while he was Alabama’s senator and served on the Armed Services Committee, MoveOn.org was already outside the U.S. Department of Justice building calling for Sessions’ resignation.

Sessions maintains that the conversations did not concern the 2016 presidential campaign. He served as an informal adviser to Trump during the presidential race.

MoveOn.org and Indivisible are also planning what the groups claim will be a massive anti-Trump Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15.

Meanwhile, lawyers from the ACLU and other groups financed by Soros were signatories to a lawsuit filed to block Trump’s original refugee order. In response to the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly issued an emergency order that temporarily blocked U.S. authorities from deporting travelers from the nations listed in Trump’s executive order.

Obama’s newfound activism seems to bring him back to his early days in the 1980s as an Alinsky-inspired community organizer working in the South Side of Chicago.

As a reporter at WND.com, this journalist previously extensively documented Obama’s ties to Alinsky ideology.

Here are a few samples:

The executive director of an activist organization that taught Alinsky’s tactics of direct action, confrontation and intimidation was part of the team that developed volunteers for President Obama’s 2008 campaign.

Jackie Kendall, executive director of the Midwest Academy, was on the team that developed Camp Obama, a two-to-four day intensive course run in conjunction with Obama’s campaign. It trained volunteers to become activists to help Obama win the presidential election.

WND also reported the Woods Fund, a nonprofit for which Obama served as a paid board director from 1999 to December 2002, provided capital to the Midwest Academy.

Obama sat on the Woods Fund board alongside William Ayers, founder of the Weather Underground domestic terrorist organization.

Also, in 1998, Obama participated in a panel discussion praising Alinsky alongside Midwest Academy’s founder Heather Booth, an organizer and dedicated disciple of Alinsky.

The panel discussion following the opening performance in Chicago of the play “The Love Song of Saul Alinsky,” a work described by the Chicago Sun-Times as “bringing to life one of America’s greatest community organizers.”

Obama participated in the discussion alongside other Alinskyites, including Booth, political analyst Aaron Freeman, Don Turner of the Chicago Federation of Labor and Northwestern University history professor Charles Paine.

Perhaps tellingly, Alinsky’s son, L. David Alinsky, praised Obama in August 2008 for his showing at the Democratic National Convention, which had the “elements of the perfectly organized event, Saul Alinsky style,” according to the son.

David Alinsky wrote:

Barack Obama’s training in Chicago by the great community organizers is showing its effectiveness. It is an amazingly powerful format, and the method of my late father always works to get the message out and get the supporters on board. When executed meticulously and thoughtfully, it is a powerful strategy for initiating change and making it really happen. Obama learned his lesson well.

I am proud to see that my father’s model for organizing is being applied successfully beyond local community organizing to affect the Democratic campaign in 2008. It is a fine tribute to Saul Alinsky as we approach his 100th birthday.

David Horowitz, founder of the David Horowitz Freedom Center and a former 1960’s radical, considers Alinsky to be the “communist/Marxist fellow-traveler who helped establish the dual political tactics of confrontation and infiltration that characterized the 1960s and have remained central to all subsequent revolutionary movements in the United States.”

Goldman Sachs estimates that almost one million foreign H-1B contract workers are now employed in college-level jobs throughout the United States, even though many media outlets routinely say the federal government approves only 85,000 H-1B visas per year.

Goldman’s February estimate of the huge H-1B population also ignores multiple other visa programs which invite foreign graduates to work in the United States. These other temporary work visas are used to employ an additional 470,000 foreign college graduates in the United States, according to a study released on March 7 by the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute.

The EPI study, titled “Temporary foreign workers by the numbers,” says U.S. companies employ roughly 470,000 foreign professionals via the little-known O, L, J, OPT, and TN visas.

The EPI study estimates that the H-1B population at a much lower level of only 460,000 employees, partly because EPI says many H-1B workers quickly get permanent green cards, which converts them into legal residents, not contract workers.

If Goldman’s estimate of almost one million H-1Bs is combined with the EPI’s estimate of various other skilled white-collar visa programs, then the government data shows that U.S. companies employ roughly 1.4 million lower-wage college-graduate temporary workers in the United States. The imported workers are not immigrants, citizens, legal residents or green card holders, but are supposed to return home after several years.

Companies have used them to fill enough outsourced jobs to fully employ nearly all Americans who graduated from college with skilled degrees in 2015 and 2016. This population of white-collar temporary workers has pushed many established U.S. workers out of jobs, partly because none of the visa programs require that Americans be hired before foreigners.

“I’m working at one of the Home Depot [hardware store] … there’s a lot of people in my position,” said Les, a former New York City technology worker for Disney, Pearson publishing, and other U.S. companies. He was pushed out of the business when companies outsourced their U.S. workplaces to Indian companies, many of which need U.S-based H-1B workers to link their U.S. clients to outsourcing offices in India. Les has a 13-year-old teenager to raise, and would return to the sector if he got a job offer, he said. “That’s what I know– it is not like I could go back to school to become a dentist or lawyer or a teacher,” he told Breitbart News.

The two new reports also that U.S. companies also employ roughly 185,000 foreign blue-collar temporary workers, plus roughly 200,000 foreign white-collar temporary workers. The EPI report also says the population of agricultural contract-workers is roughly 75,000, or just seven percent of at least 930,000 university trained guest-workers resident in the United States.

Campaign Promises

The huge U.S.-based population of professional-grade foreign contract workers—ranging from 1.4 million up to 1.8 million—is a problem for President Donald Trump, who repeatedly promised to reform the H-1B program during his 2016 campaign.

“I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program,” said a Trump statement in 2016. “No exceptions.” In his inauguration speech, Trump declared his national economic policy is: “Buy American, Hire American.”

So far, Trump has not revamped the H-1B program, although his deputies have temporarily ended a fast-track H-1B approval process supported by business groups. That change was adopted amid intense lobbying by brand-name companies—including Google, Microsoft, Facebook—to preserve the annual inflow of cheap white-collar workers.

On April 3, the Department of Labor will start distributing another 85,000 H-1B visas to companies, as required by law.

Statements from White House officials suggest that a reform of the H-1B program will be linked to a larger plan to comprehensively reform the nation’s family-chain immigration system into Trump’s proposed merit-based immigration system.

Business groups will likely oppose Trump’s merit-based immigration reform unless they can negotiate a promise for additional H-1B contract workers. In 2013, Democratic politicians supported this negotiated demand by business groups, because the business groups promised to pressure GOP politicians to create “a path to citizenship” for the resident population of at least 11 million illegal aliens.

Trump would be reluctant to endorse any increase in white-collar contract workers because polls show that voters—especially his voters—want Americans to get jobs before companies can import more contract workers.

For more than 20 years, blue-collar pay-packets have been slashed by the large population of 8 million working illegal immigrants, and by the legal immigration of roughly 800,000 non-college immigrants each year.

University-trained Americans now face a growing economic threat from the inflow of university-grade contract workers.

No matter their skills, American white-collar workers face a huge disadvantage because the guest-workers have a much greater incentive to work long hours at low wages.

The distorting incentive is the federal government’s willingness to offer a deferred bonus of citizenship to foreign workers who stay in their temp jobs for six to 10 years. This government-provided, deferred compensation package is worth many millions of dollars to contract workers, partly because the citizenship benefit can be duplicated for their spouses, children, parents, siblings, and descendants.

Those benefits of citizenship are vast — they include all of the rights enunciated in the U.S. Constitution, plus the right to live in a high-trust society largely free of petty corruption, clannishness or tribalism, of class, caste, racial or regional discrimination, plus full access to the efficient economy, the free education system, the massive federal welfare system and the national banking system, plus the physical security ensured by gun rights, law-abiding neighbors, efficient police and military services.

But companies cannot offer American job-seekers this subsidy instead of wages because the Americans already are citizens.

If they want to hire an American instead of a foreign contract worker, companies have to pay Americans their full, unsubsidized marketplace value. So the hidden federal subsidy of citizenship-for-foreigners skews hiring practices in favor of foreign workers, much to the disadvantage of the 800,000 young Americans who graduate with skilled degrees each year.

Federal data shows that relatively few American graduates even get jobs in the high-skilled sectors which they studied — at great cost — in university. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in July that 2014 that:

74 percent of those who have a bachelor’s degree in science, technology, engineering and math — commonly referred to as STEM — are not employed in STEM occupations … According to new statistics from the 2012 American Community Survey, engineering and computer, math and statistics majors had the largest share of graduates going into a STEM field with about half employed in a STEM occupation. Science majors had fewer of their graduates employed in STEM.

Roughly 660,000 foreign H-1B workers are employed throughout the U.S. software business, says the Goldman report. Many are employed in writing software, but many foreigners are hired as cheap managers, business experts, financial analysts, and salesmen by American and foreign-owned companies. An additional 340,000 H-1B contract workers are employed throughout the nation as doctors, therapists and pharmacists, professors, engineers and financial planners, managers and designers, soccer coaches and economics teachers, government scientists and university lab technicians, architects, lawyers and even journalists, according to job descriptions found at MyVisaJobs.com.

Amid this widespread use of white-collar contract workers, the salaries of young American professionals have stalled since the real-estate bubble imploded. In the last five years, they’ve grown by roughly one percent a year—after deducting inflation—according to a January 2017 report titled “National Compensation Forecast,” by the Economic Research Institute.

During the same five-year period, slow-growing salaries, increased company profits, and sales have pushed the Dow Jones Index of stocks up by 60 percent.

If the contract-worker programs were sharply reduced, Americans companies would be forced to compete for the limited pool of Americans by offering higher salaries. The resulting “tight labor market” for Americans graduates would push up average salaries, give underemployed graduates an escape from low-wage jobs (such as at Starbucks), boost recruitment of older professionals, spur productivity-boosting technology investment, and also greatly increase the opportunities for American teenagers, dropouts and the unemployed to study for college degrees.

Even minor reforms of the H-1B program—such as minimum-salary rules—would boost salaries by 10 percent for the many U.S.-based employees of Indian-owned outsourcing companies, says the Goldman Sachs report.

The H-1B Population

The lack of public data about the number of resident H-1Bs is “absurd,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

“This is a basic piece of information that the public should know, and the problem is not even that the government has the numbers and isn’t releasing them—rather the government doesn’t know the number itself,” he said.

The establishment media tend to ignore the issue of H-1B numbers or just to highlight the annual inflow of guest-workers instead of describing the full resident population.

Calculating the total numbers is difficult. The guest-worker program is managed collectively by the departments of Labor, State, and Homeland Security. Each agency collects data on different aspects of the program, including the number of requests for work visas, the number of visas that are approved, and the arrival or departure of contract workers.

Also, the regulatory details of the H-1B program are complex. The basic regulations say each H-1B visa lasts for three years—and can be automatically extended for another three years. In theory, that would limit the H-1B population to a maximum of six times the annual apparent cap of 85,000, or a total of 510,000.

But, the program has many loopholes which are used by immigration lawyers to bring in an extra 20,000 extra H-1B workers per year, to lengthen the stay of many H-1Bs by several years and to get work permits for some spouses of H-1B workers.

Goldman Sachs’ February study, titled “The H-1B Visa Debate: A Global FAQ for Investors,” tried to count these extra workers and extra years, saying:

“We estimate that 900k to 1mn individuals are working under H-1B visas in the US today, based on the assumption that most existing visas are renewed for a second term, and that about two-thirds of qualified H-1B visa holders eventually apply for a green card (based on average wait times and green card quotas for countries affected) … figures would be slightly higher when including spouses of H-1B visa holders (which could be as many as 500k people based on prevailing marriage rates of roughly 50% across countries).

That number is much larger that a 2011 estimate by the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies, which estimated the population of H-1Bs to be roughly 650,000.

Additional White-Collar Visa Programs

Both the EPI and the Goldman studies ignore different parts of the massive white-collar contract labor force in the United States.

The Goldman report understates the total number of foreign-born, white-collar contract workers in the United States by downplaying several additional visa programs that are similar to the H-1B program.

In contrast, the EPI report shows that these additional visa programs keep an extra population of roughly 450,000 skilled white-collar workers in the United States. For example, the EPI study says the J visa delivers roughly 56,000 professionals, the Optional Practical Training program employs almost 140,000 graduates, the free-trade visas supply another 50,000 professionals, and the L visas allow 350,000 blue-collar or white-collar foreign company employees to work in the United States.

The Goldman report also shows—but does not count—the annual inflow of white-collar workers via the L, B and O visa programs. The 2015 inflow of these contract workers is 180,000, said the report. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests these visa programs are used by a resident population of 200,000 white-collar, guest-workers residing in the United States.

But the Goldman report also does not mention the J visas or the Optional Practical Training visas, which together deliver almost 200,000 foreign college graduates to work in the United States, according to EPI.

The EPI study ignores the fact that President Barack Obama allowed the spouses of H-1B workers to get jobs. The Goldman report says that roughly 500,000 spouses of H-1B workers are now allowed to get jobs in the United States. The Goldman report does not say how many of the H-1B spouses are working in skilled white-collar jobs, but if that number is only one-fifth of the resident H-1B spouses, then the number of foreign white-collar contract workers would climb by up to 100,000 people.

If Goldman’s estimate of almost one million H-1Bs, is combined with the EPI’s estimate of other skilled white-collar visa programs, the data shows that U.S. companies employ roughly 1.4 million white-collar, foreign contract workers in the United States.

That’s enough jobs to fully employ nearly all Americans who graduated from college with skilled degrees in 2015 and 2016.

Even if the EPIs lower estimate for the H-1B population is correct, then the extra visas programs show the number of university-trained contract workers in the United States up to roughly 940,000.

Goldman’s estimate of almost one million H-1Bs is much higher than the EPI estimate because Goldman estimates many H-1Bs are waiting for green cards instead of returning home.

Green Cards

Roughly two-thirds of H-1B workers apply for green cards, says Goldman. The pipeline for green cards is very backed up because only a maximum of 140,000 green cards are awarded to foreign employees and their family members each year. This backed-up pipeline ensures that many H-1Bs stay in the United States longer than six years by getting one-year or three-year H-1B renewals as they wait to get green cards.

In contrast, the EPI report reduces its estimate of the resident H-1B population by concluding that 140,000 H-1B visa workers quickly got permanent green cards in 2011, 2012 and 2013, so reducing the number of contract workers in the H-1B program.

Both reports acknowledge that many contract workers get green cards and remain in the United States. But neither report counts the number of former contract workers who have won green cards, and who are free to compete against American graduates for jobs.

That number is difficult to count because the federal government distributes 140,000 green cards to company employees each year, but those cards must be shared with family members, including spouses and children.

The green card numbers add up. For example, if 40,000 skilled workers get Green Cards each year for the next decade, that delivers another 400,000 foreign-born skilled workers into the U.S. labor market to compete against Americans. If two-thirds of those 400,000 future green card workers are information-technology H-1Bs, they will be enough to grab 54 percent of the extra 488,500 new technology jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects will be added to the economy over the next decade.

In 2016, Breitbart surveyed the data for three Midwestern states, and concluded up to 75,000 foreign college grads have gotten green cards since 1990.

Like many other name-brand companies and universities, Goldman hires thousands of H-1B workers for jobs sought by young American business graduates and tries to get green cards for hundreds of its employees. The company numbers are shown by this chart found at MyVisasJobs.com, which relies on government data to track the H-1B marketplace.

The annual inflow of skilled workers with green cards would be far higher if the 2013 “Gang of Eight immigration bill had passed. That bill allowed universities to get green cards for an unlimited number of foreign customers who paid for a Masters Degree at a U.S. university. Thea plan died in 2014 when GOP House Speaker John Boehner recognized the high level of public opposition to the amnesty and cheap-labor bill.

Universities and Non-Profits

The Goldman report does not mention the semi-secret supply of H-1B visas granted to non-profit universities and non-profit affiliates of major companies.

Non-profits can hire as many H-1B workers as they wish each year, and now employ roughly 85,000 H-1B workers as professors, doctors, researchers, and designers. That 85,000 estimate is only for contract workers holding the renewable three-year H1-B visas, and it excludes H-1B workers who are in the process of getting green cards. The Goldman report says two-thirds of H-1B holders try for green cards, so pushing up the universities’ likely employment of H-1Bs up to roughly 130,000 foreign contract workers. That overall university population is likely included in Goldman’s estimate of almost one million resident H-1Bs.

Other Contract Workers

The EPI estimate says the resident population of blue-collar contract workers is roughly 95,000 H-2B workers plus roughly 90,000 unskilled J-1 “Summer Work Travel” workers, many of whom work blue-collar jobs at vacation resorts.

The EPI data also suggests that 200,000 unskilled white-collar contract workers live in the United States.

We Are Chicago by Culture Shock Games seeks to depict the truth of a city drowning in its own blood in an effort to stanch the flow.

762 murders were committed in Chicago in 2016, and 2017 isn’t looking any better. President Trump tweeted that the violence is “totally out of control,” exclaiming, “Chicago needs help!” following the shooting deaths of seven people in one day in February.

Seven people shot and killed yesterday in Chicago. What is going on there – totally out of control. Chicago needs help! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2017

The developers at Culture Shock Games are trying to do their part to help with We Are Chicago, what they hope is an affecting interactive walk in the shoes of fictional Chicago youth Aaron Davis.

Aaron is a high school senior with a younger sister and a single mom. He is also a citizen of Chicago’s dangerous streets, and his journey asks the player to navigate a world in which deadly violence is a daily reality. Whether it is the sound of gunfire at dinner or Aaron’s friend holding up the fast food joint where he works, players are confronted with uncomfortably realistic scenarios that represent snapshots from the lives of real people.

Based on interviews with residents, We Are Chicago draws its inspiration from the reality of life in the Windy City. Aaron struggles to avoid the influence of gangs — a support structure that tempts many desperate urban youths with the promise of security, community, and income when jobs are scarce — while navigating family life and the demands of school.

The game released in February, but it has had a rough go on the Steam marketplace. Despite its thought-provoking mission, players have noted a host of technical issues that detract from the experience — or even make it outright unplayable. It also isn’t very long — about the length of a single chapter in the Telltale adventure games, whose influence We Are Chicago wears on its sleeve.

President Donald Trump will lay a wreath on former president Andrew Jackson’s grave on Wednesday before holding a rally for supporters in Nashville, Tennessee, according to CNN.

It’s another symbolic gesture towards Jackson’s legacy as a self-made man who represented the common people over the elites enraged by his rise. Trump hung a portrait of the seventh president in the Oval Office five days into his presidency.

“There hasn’t been anything like this since Andrew Jackson,” Trump said at the time of his inauguration. The president admires Jackson, calling him “an amazing figure in American history—very unique so many ways.” Trump especially respected Jackson’s “ability to never give up.”

Trump’s advisors have compared him and his populist, nationalist movement to Jackson. White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon called Trump’s inauguration speech “Jacksonian,” and said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter that “like Jackson’s populism, we’re going to build an entirely new political movement.”

“I’d say [Donald Trump] is the best public orator since William Jennings Bryan, and he has a better sense of the pulse of the people than any President at least since Andrew Jackson,” White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller told ABC News in February.

As Breitbart News’ Warner Todd Huston pointed out, the elites excoriated Jackson for letting the common man make themselves heard. Like Trump, Jackson rallied enormous numbers of Americans together while pursuing a populist agenda.

“No one who was at Washington at the time of General Jackson’s inauguration is likely to forget that period to the day of his death,” journalist and author Arthur J. Stansbury recalled at the time, as explained in a biography of Francis Scott Key.

“To us, who had witnessed the quiet and orderly period of the Adams administration, it seemed as if half the nation had rushed at once into the capital. It was like the inundation of the northern barbarians into Rome, save that the tumultuous tide came in from a different point of the compass,” he continued. “The West and the South seemed to have precipitated themselves upon the North and overwhelmed it. On that memorable occasion you might tell a ‘Jackson man’ almost as far as you could see him. Their every motion seemed to cry out ‘Victory!’”

The Obama administration had wanted to remove Jackson from the $20 bill.

President Donald Trump has instructed the State Department to slash its $10 billion budget for funding United Nations programs by as much as 50 percent, Foreign Policy is reporting.

The article said the move is “signaling an unprecedented retreat by [the] administration from international operations that keep the peace, provide vaccines for children, monitor rogue nuclear weapons programs, and promote peace talks from Syria to Yemen.”

FP used three unnamed sources for its report, which also called Trump’s directive “draconian measures” taken ahead of the planned release on Thursday of his 2018 federal budget proposal.

The budget “is expected to include cuts of up to 37 percent for spending on the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign assistance programs, including the U.N., in next year’s budget,” according to the report, which went on:

It remains unclear whether the full extent of the steeper U.N. cuts will be reflected in the 2018 budget, which will be prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget, or whether, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has proposed, the cuts would be phased in over the coming three years. One official close to the Trump administration said Tillerson has been given flexibility to decide how the cuts would be distributed.

Richard Gowan, a U.N. expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told FP these budget cuts would create “chaos.”

The U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), for example, received nearly 40 percent of its budget from the United States in 2016. Cutting the U.S. contribution would “leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,” according to Gowan.

The left-leaning FP cites Trump’s intention to cut diplomacy and foreign assistance programs will help him increase the funding for the U.S. military by $54 billion, a “shift” from the Obama administration’s approach to the federal budget.

“State Department officials, for instance, were told that they should try to identify up to $1 billion in cuts in the U.N. peacekeeping budget, according to one source,” FP reported. “The United States provides about $2.5 billion per year to fund peacekeepers.”

Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, cautioned against “slash-and-burn cuts” during her Senate confirmation hearing but is said to be reviewing the U.N.’s 16 peacekeeping missions for possible cuts.

The United States pays over 22 percent of the U.N.’s $2.5 billion yearly administrative budget, including money “to battle climate change.”

FP reported that “U.N. diplomats and foreign dignitaries say they expect the United States to seek to eliminate funding for some agencies unpopular with conservatives — including the U.N. Population Fund, which receives about $35 million a year from the United States for family planning programs, and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.”

Also, “the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, has long been the target of Israeli and congressional criticism on the grounds that it has a pro-Palestinian bias.

According to the FP report:

But one diplomat said UNRWA might be spared because it relieves Israel of the obligation to care for some Palestinians and because Israel sees the program as ultimately promoting stability. The United States has broad discretion to cut voluntary funds to humanitarian agencies, including the World Food Programme and UNICEF. But those programs are popular among Democrats and Republicans, and any move to slash funding could undermine Washington’s case for leading those agencies.

In the early days of his administration, Trump reinstated the “Mexico City Policy,” a policy first instituted by President Ronald Reagan and continued by Republican presidents since. The policy prohibits funding international NGOs and other entities that provide or promote abortion around the globe.

“Anticipating cuts to family planning programs, Dutch Development Minister Lilianne Ploumen recently established a fund to solicit contributions to institutions that have faced a cutoff of U.S. assistance because they perform abortions,” FP reported.

FP also reported that if the U.S. “fails to honor its funding commitments to the U.N.’s regular budget, which is obligatory, it could lose its voting rights in the General Assembly.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aceebdd28:a9fb2:1256fb20</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

A new report shows sanctuary jurisdictions growing at an alarming rate. The Ohio Jobs and Justice Political Action Committee (OJJ) totaled nearly 500 sanctuary cities. The group has been tracking sanctuary cities for more than 10 years.

The report claims sanctuary cities grew to nearly 500 with the addition of 36 new locales in 2017, The Washington Times reported. Previous reports by other organizations have listed sanctuary jurisdictions at around 300.

“More will be coming,” Steve Salvi, founder of OJJ told the Washington Times. “A lot of communities now, there’s resolutions in the works and citizens groups encouraging city councils to pass them.”

Despite the risk of losing federal law enforcement grants, Salvi said local governments are under increasing pressure to adopt sanctuary city status. Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on sanctuary jurisdictions and actions by state and local governments across the country.

The State of Texas is currently evaluating state and federal grants paid to Travis County (Austin) to determine how much money can be withheld from the county for failing to cooperate with federal immigration officials. The state would take the funding from the county under a bill, SB4, outlawing sanctuary cities in the state, Breitbart Texas reported on Tuesday. The bill currently is in the State House after passing in the Senate last month.

Salvi expressed surprise that four sanctuary cities have been removed, or will shortly be removed, after changing policies and returning to cooperation with federal immigration officials. He reports that Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, have both been removed after their respective city councils passed resolutions affirming cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security.

Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Giménez responded quickly to the Trump Administration’s threats to withhold federal law enforcement grants and agreed to comply with all detainers, Breitbart Texas reported. Throughout 2016, the city ignored around 100 immigration holds. Miami-Dade is one of the 10 sanctuary jurisdictions certified by the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General and not eligible to receive federal law enforcement grants.

Dayton, Ohio, also reversed course on February 16, Salvi reported. The Dayton police chief reportedly rescinded its sanctuary policy established in 2010. That claim is currently being reviewed to determine if they City is actually in compliance. Breitbart Texas reached out to the City of Dayton for more information about this alleged change in immigration policy.

A Harvard-Harris Poll released in February revealed that about 80 percent of American voters disapprove of sanctuary cities, Breitbart Texas reported. More than 50 percent support President Trump’s executive order calling for stripping federal law enforcement funding from sanctuary cities. Harvard-Harris Co-Director Mark Penn said there is overwhelming opposition to sanctuary cities. “The public wants honest immigrants treated fairly and those who commit crimes deported and that’s very clear from the data.”

Did you hear the speech that Al Gore gave in Texas the other day saying that the oil industry should take climate change more seriously, that oil could peak in the next decade, that the “social acceptance” for oil was disappearing, that there needed to be a meaningful tax on carbon emissions and that he “strongly supported” the Paris climate agreement?

Oh no, wait. It wasn’t Al Gore. My bad. It was actually Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Shell speaking at an oil industry gathering at the U.S. oil capital of Houston.

Now do you see why I so hate Big Oil?

Well, partly it’s bitterness. For many years now, I – and many sceptics like me – have been accused by climate alarmists of being “in the pay of Big Oil”. But even though we deserve it for promoting fossil fuels so enthusiastically and fighting their critics so heroically, few of us have ever received even a penny for our troubles. That’s because Big Oil is far too busy trying to greenwash its image – as Shell itself did by sponsoring the Guardian’s environment pages for many years – to waste time on the plucky, outspoken heroes who do a better job for Big Oil’s PR than the Big Oil’s paid PR departments do.

Mainly, though it’s disgust. Big Oil has this public image of being an industry for fearless, no-nonsense manly men who aren’t afraid of getting their hands dirty or braving the environmentalists’ wrath in order to do their ugly but important work supplying the world with much-needed energy.

Yet it’s an image almost entirely undeserved.

Almost everyone at a senior level in Big Oil is a craven, simpering, politically correct, spineless, surrender-monkey corporate shill. They’re cowards who are scared of free markets, won’t speak up for capitalism, won’t even defend their core business. Typical of this attitude was the current Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

One of his first moves on becoming CEO of Exxon in 2006 was to announce it would stop funding organisations like the Competitive Enterprise Institute “whose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner.” Unlike his punchier predecessor Lee Raymond, Tillerson clearly decided that discretion being the better part of valor, he would throw his industry’s supporters to the wolves.

One of the first big energy stories I covered for Breitbart was the incredible true story of how Chevron Oil fought off a $9.5 billion damages case filed on behalf of Ecuadorean natives whose lands had supposedly been polluted as a result of Chevron’s negligence.

The truly incredible part of the story was that Chevron decided to defend the case. The more usual position of Big Oil is to surrender as soon as possible and settle out of court.

If Big Oil won’t speak out for the oil industry, who will?

Sadly, the burden invariably falls to that small group of maverick believers in free markets and honest science who don’t care about all the brickbats they get for being defenders of “dirty fuel” because they’d rather speak the truth than be popular.

Among them is Steve Milloy who, May 2008, intervened in an Exxon shareholder meeting on behalf of all those shareholders who think that Exxon’s core business should be drilling oil and creating value for shareholders – not getting distracted by trying to make themselves look cuter for their Watermelon (green on the outside, red on the inside) critics. Follow this link and you can hear the huge round applause Milloy won from shareholders when he proposed that Exxon should amend its bye-laws so that it no longer had to waste time on politicised interventions from “nuisance shareholders”.

Stock ownership has become politicized. Many shareholders own stock in publicly-owned corporations for the sole purpose of advancing the shareholders’ own social or political agendas, while simultaneously assailing the corporations’ legitimate business operations. These activist shareholders are “nuisance shareholders.” A primary tool of nuisance shareholders is the submission of non-binding precatory (advisory) proposals for discussion and vote at annual meetings of shareholders. Proposals from nuisance shareholders can coerce management into making decisions not in the best interests of the Company and its bona fide shareholders, and turn the annual meeting into a media-activist circus.

You’d think Exxon would have been grateful for this fire support from their public. Not one bit. We can see this from Exxon’s response to a submission from Milloy that he intends to make a similar proposal at Exxon’s next shareholder meeting this May. They applied to the SEC to try to get Milloy’s proposal excluded.

Happily, the SEC’s lawyer wasn’t having it.

It goes without saying that Exxon, like Shell, like most Big Oil companies, like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is now using its influence to try to prevent President Trump to fulfil his campaign trail promise to withdraw the U.S. from the UN Paris Climate Agreement.

Ostensibly their excuse is that it would be bad for US international relations and “send the wrong signals”.

In reality, it’s for the worst of reasons. First, it’s because spinelessness is an integral part of their corporate culture: they’ve spent years surrendering to the green movement by paying it Danegeld and by paying lip service to its eco pieties – and they’re not about to grow a pair just because Donald Trump is president.

Second, it’s because they’re so heavily diversified into eco-friendly sectors like “renewables” and into unproven but lucrative technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage that they can’t afford the massive hit they’d suffer if Trump were to sever all ties with the Climate Industrial Complex.

Big Oil is evil all right but not in the way the Greenies would have you think. It’s because, heeding the voices of the industry’s Wormtongues, Big Oil surrendered to the dark forces of Eco Mordor.

It makes you hope that the smaller scale producers of the global fracking industry go from strength to strength – and make the politically correct Big Oil monoliths history.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ace4174ab:5319a0:93371e27</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

House Speaker Ryan should resign his post, says Lou Dobbs, the radio host, and anchor of Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business Network.

Dobbs Tweeted his resignation call Tuesday morning after Breitbart posted a pre-election recording of Ryan saying he would never defend President Donald Trump, and as multiple GOP legislators walked away from Ryan’s Obamacare replacement proposal, the American Health Care Act.

Ryan Should Resign: Exclusive — Audio of Ryan Abandoning @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ICR3tNolhB #MAGA @POTUS #TrumpTrain #Dobbs — Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) March 14, 2017

In the audiotape, recorded Oct. 10, 2016, Ryan told his fellow GOP legislators that ““I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future.” Ryan spoke shortly after the public heard the Access Hollywood tape of Trump’s conversation in which he said about women that “when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”

Dobbs followed up his call for Ryan’s resignation with two Tweets calling for the full repeal of Obamacare. One Tweet describes Ryan’s proposed alternative as “RyanCare,” and said it is failing.

Cliff Sims, special assistant to President Trump, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday about the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) release on the American Health Care Act.

While disputing the CBO numbers, Sims said, “This bill is still a work in progress. This bill is not finalized. The president has met with conservative allies over the last week or so, from the Heritage Foundation to Freedom Works and many other groups that have come in and met with him.” Sims also cited members of congress and the Freedom Caucus as having met with Trump recently to share their concerns and ideas regarding any final bill.

“I’ve been in the room,” added Sims, “where someone will bring up an idea or change that they’re suggesting to the bill, and the president will turn to the HHS secretary, the OMB director, or, if it’s Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell in the room, and say, ‘Will you guys think about this? Let’s kick this around. Let’s see if this is something that we should add.&apos;”

Sims also paraphrased Trump’s recently expressed sentiments that “things are still under negotiation. We’re still trying to strengthen this bill. There’s a long way to go.”

Indianapolis-based attorney and radio host Greg Garrison posed an interesting question on his program on WIBC radio on Tuesday morning: why couldn’t Congress and the White House propose a better Obamacare replacement on day one?

After all, with the Congressional Budget Office reporting Monday that the American Health Care Act will increase the number of uninsured Americans by 24 million, and President Donald Trump promising to negotiate fixes, would it not have been easier and better to craft the best policy possible well in advance, and avoid the growing political backlash around the country?

The answer is no, for three reasons.

First, to some in Congress, this is the best policy possible.

The experts who wrote it tried to anticipate opposition from the Democratic Party, and included several compromises in the bill. They also crafted a staged process that achieves easier fixes through budget reconciliation on a simple majority vote, and leaves more difficult changes to the end, when proponents of the reform would need a 60-vote majority in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster.

But by beginning with a compromise “ideal,” the drafters guaranteed that the final legislation would require even more concessions from conservatives. It would have been better, simply from the point of view of negotiating tactics, to begin with a much more conservative bill — one that made repealing Obamacare explicit and complete before introducing new changes, for example — and work back to the compromise position. Instead, conservatives were immediately suspicious of the bill.

The second reason a perfect policy was impossible on day one is that perfection implies that stakeholders — doctors and patients in particular — are superfluous to policy design.

But the opposite is true: without including all stakeholders in a system this big, there is no way of earning the grudging support of groups whose members might suffer short-term costs.

And the third reason perfection was impossible on day one is that our political system simply rejects it. Collectively, we want to argue over the details. We want the opposition to be able to have its say; we want elected representatives to hear an earful from the voters; we want the stakeholders to hold endless and exhausting meetings where they haggle over minor points.

The last administration thought it could simply presuppose an ideal policy, force it through Congress, and read it afterwards. As a result, the country was divided, the policy was awful, and petulant left-wing pundits declared the country “ungovernable.”

We are not ungovernable. This is how we want to govern ourselves.

President Trump is a political outsider, but appears to understand the process better than the professionals. He likely anticipated the weaknesses of the new bill, and gave Congress enough rope to hang itself, politically.

Now, he is well-placed to lead the “big, fat, beautiful negotiation” that is to follow.

House Speaker Paul Ryan just got even more bad news on Tuesday: His own constituents like President Donald Trump more than him and think his Obamacare 2.0 bill is bad legislation.

A survey conducted by Public Policy Polling from March 9 to March 10 of 519 voters in Wisconsin’s first congressional district finds that a majority—50 percent—have a favorable view of President Donald Trump. Only 47 percent have an unfavorable view of Trump, while three percent are unsure. Ryan, meanwhile, has only 49 percent in his district who have a favorable view of him, while 44 percent have an unfavorable view and seven percent are unsure. That means more people in Paul Ryan’s own district like Donald Trump more than they like Paul Ryan.

If that news was not bad enough for Ryan, his own constituents are aligned against his Obamacare 2.0 bill—also called RINO-CARE, Ryancare, or Obamacare Lite—the American Health Care Act. “Do you support or oppose Paul Ryan and the Republicans’ new health care bill, which would cause millions to lose their health insurance?” respondents were asked. The bill, which does not repeal Obamacare and would, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a separate internal Trump administration White House analysis, cause anywhere from 24 to 26 million people to lose health insurance over the next decade, only gets 37 percent of Ryan’s district in support of it—while 46 percent, a strong plurality, oppose Ryan’s healthcare bill. Sixteen percent are unsure.

The news of this survey showing that Trump has eclipsed Ryan in popularly in Ryan’s own oasis of political solidarity—Ryan has long held his Janesville home and his district as a whole out as a place where he can escape from the day-to-day battles in Washington—comes on the heels of the revelation that Ryan said in October he will never defend Trump again.

“I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future,” Ryan said in the audio of an Oct. 10, 2016, conference call, obtained by Breitbart News.

The audio of the call was published by Breitbart News late Monday evening, and on it Ryan details for House Republicans—in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape release about Trump during the election—how he was abandoning the Republican presidential nominee on the campaign trail. On it, Ryan walks through how he disinvited Trump from a rally in Wisconsin’s first congressional district–where Trump is now more popular than Ryan.

In response to the audio, Ryan’s waning popularity, and his failures on healthcare, House GOP members have begun discussions about replacing Ryan as Speaker of the House with a Republican alternative more interested in working well with President Trump.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15acdeedb91:414625:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot, said Monday on CNBC that he thinks President Donald Trump could go down as “one of our greatest presidents ever,” and has “guts,” and “great people around him.”

“[T]his guy has got guts,” Langone said on “Squawk Box.” “And he’s got great people around him.” He added that White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway’s husband is one of his lawyers.

Trump has the potential to “go down as one of our greatest presidents ever,” Langone later argued.

There are more than 500,000 pending immigration court cases for illegal aliens which will decide whether or not they are eligible to remain in the U.S., according to new data released.

In data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, released by Fox News, a tally of pending immigration cases show that there are approximately 542,411 that have yet to be decided by an immigration judge.

That number means American taxpayers pay for illegal aliens to sometimes be held in detention centers for 673 days before their case even hits an immigration judge’s courtroom.

In states with much larger migrant populations–like Texas and California–the wait period is even longer, running roughly three years. In sanctuary San Francisco, there are 38,428 pending cases.

U.S. Immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks told Fox News that the massive backlog in immigration courts has been made worse, as administration after administration has done hardly nothing to remedy the problem.

“We have been a neglected part of the immigration enforcement world for so long,” Marks said in the interview. “There are legitimate concerns about how long cases pend in the immigration court.”

The neglect could soon change with President Donald Trump’s administration, which is committing new plans and procedures to handle the immigration court backlog.

In a letter from the Department of Justice (DOJ), the administration is expected to move 50 immigration judges to detention facilities in areas like Adelanto and San Diego, California, as well as Chicago, Illinois, as Breitbart Texas reported.

Judges will hear cases from 6am to 6pm with two rotating shifts.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose task it is to help remedy the problem, has long been a critic of the nation’s immigration system, arguing that lack of border security, a slow court process and influxes in low-skilled workers all put strain on social safety nets and American taxpayers.

The White House revealed that President Donald Trump plans to call Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday as the future of the House healthcare bill hangs in the balance.

Conservative critics of the bill were emboldened after the Congressional Budget Office report warned that under Paul Ryan’s plan, 14 million people will lose insurance in 2018. The report also predicted that premiums would rise 15 to 20 percent in 2018-2019 before falling ten percent by 2026.

In an interview with Fox News, Ryan stated he was “pretty encouraged” by the report, citing predictions that it would cut $1.2 trillion in spending, $883 billion in taxes, and $337 billion in deficit reduction.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted on Monday that Trump and Ryan were in communication about the bill, but he failed to detail any phone calls between the two leaders.

“They have spoken, yes. I don’t know when the last time they had,” he said, when asked by Breitbart News if the president had called Ryan about the bill.

The bill faces its next big test in a House Budget Committee vote on Thursday. If only four House Republicans on the committee join Democrats by voting “no” on the bill, the legislation would fail to move forward.

Trump continues to support Ryan’s proposed bill, although he remains open to some changes. During a cabinet meeting at the White House on Monday, Trump signaled that he was ready to make a deal with critics.

“We’re negotiating with everybody,” he told reporters. “It’s a big, fat beautiful negotiation, and hopefully, we’ll come up with something that’s going to be really terrific.”

The president is scheduled to speak on the phone with Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy Tuesday afternoon.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15acd494ff1:379376:93371e27</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">. @Judgenap : Three intel sources have disclosed that Pres.

Fox News Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano claimed “three intelligence sources” say President Obama looked to British spy agency GCHQ to obtain transcripts of conversations involving President Donald Trump on “Fox &amp; Friends” on Tuesday.

Napolitano said, “[T]hree intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. He didn’t use the NSA. He didn’t use the CIA. He didn’t use the FBI, and he didn’t use Department of Justice. He used GCHQ. What the heck is GCHQ? That’s the initials for the British spying agency. They have 24/7 access to the NSA database. So by simply having two people go to them saying, ‘President Obama needs transcripts of conversations involving candidate Trump, conversations involving president-elect Trump,’ he’s able to get it, and there’s no American fingerprints on this.”

The White House is pushing back against the notion that health care is fine under Obamacare, blaming the media for portraying it in a positive light, rather than a looming disaster.

“It makes it seem like it’s all rainbows and puppies,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Tuesday, pointing to some of the media comparisons of the healthcare bill proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan and the current coverage offered by Obamacare.

President Donald Trump also found fault with the media for ignoring the dire situation Americans face under Obamacare.

“The press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden,” Trump said to reporters during an event with a handful of Americans who detailed frustrations with Obama’s healthcare plan.

He argued that the bill was headed for a disaster in 2017, saying that Republicans were putting themselves in a difficult position by trying to repeal it.

“I tell Tom Price, and I tell Paul Ryan. I tell every one of them. I say, “The best thing you can do politically is wait a year because it’s gonna blow itself off the map.’”

Later on Tuesday, Trump pointed to the “false” narrative that was building in the media that Obamacare was succeeding.

“It’s not okay. It’s a disaster, and people understand that it’s failed and it’s imploding,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15acd494ff1:379373:93371e27</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Upon assuming the presidency, many observers expressed reservations about what a Trump administration foreign policy would look like. More than any other representative of President Donald Trump’s government, United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley has answered those critics.

At the UN, Haley has articulated a clear vision of how America would handle itself on the world stage: a stalwart friend to its allies, fearsome foe to its enemies, and consistent voice of reason in a forum often governed by the whims of authoritarian regimes and violent special interests.

This week, for example, Haley made clear the Trump administration would stop at nothing to curb dictator Kim Jong-un’s threats in North Korea and uproot Iranian terror proxies from Syria.

“We’re not ruling anything out,” Haley told reporters on Wednesday in response to what the United States would do in response to North Korea’s latest missile tests, which Pyongyang openly admitted were in preparation for an attack on U.S. bases in Japan. She offered a staunch defense of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system: “We are not going to leave South Korea standing there with the threat of North Korea facing them and not help. The reason for THAAD is because of the actions of North Korea.”

Both China and Russia, permanent members of the UN Security Council, disapprove of the deployment of THAAD in South Korea. The system allows South Korea to reach deep into both countries, as well as North Korea, to destroy any missiles heading its way.

“Tell me why we wouldn’t do the THAAD in light of twenty-four ballistic missiles? In light of two nuclear tests?” Haley asked critics.

Haley’s support for South Korea is a far cry from what domestic and South Korean critics feared out of a Trump administration – a full withdrawal from Asia. As a candidate, Trump had encouraged both nations to be self-reliant, even invoking the possibility of nuclear weapons development.

Critics also claimed Trump’s White House would remain silent in the face of Russian belligerence in Eastern Europe. As chief international representative to that White House, Haley has done no such thing. On the contrary; her debut before the UN Security Council was a condemnation of Russian military incursions into Eastern Ukraine. “I consider it unfortunate on the occasion of my first appearance here I must condemn the aggressive actions of Russia,” she said during her first appearance before the Security Council. “We do want to better our relations with Russia… however, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.”

“We have criticized Russia for Crimea and Ukraine, for the actions they’ve taken there. We will call them out when we see something wrong. If we see where we can work together, of course, we’re going to try and do that,” Haley told an Al Jazeera journalist this week, once again condemning Russia, this time for supporting Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and opposing resolutions condemning his use of chemical weapons against civilians.

Haley has also been excellent as a vocal ally of Israel, the only functioning democracy in the Middle East. Among her first acts as UN Ambassador were a visit to the family of an Israel soldier killed by the terrorist group Hamas and a rebuke of the Security Council generally for its “obsession” with Israel.

Calling its attacks on Israel “breathtaking,” Haley highlighted in February that the UN “Department of Political Affairs has an entire department devoted to Palestinian affairs… there is not a division devoted to illegal missile launches from North Korea.”

“There is no division devoted to the world’s number one state sponsor of terror, Iran,” she noted, a country she demanded the international community take out of Syria entirely this week, despite Iran being Assad’s most prominent ally.

“I’m here to say the United States will not turn a blind eye to this anymore. I’m here to underscore the ironclad support of the United States for Israel,” she concluded.

Haley’s support of Israel is a particularly striking contrast with her predecessor Samantha Power’s decision to abstain from a Security Council vote against Israel in December, a final abandonment of America’s longtime ally on the world stage before President Obama’s departure.

In these three key regions – Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East – Haley has sent a message to the enemies of freedom that her predecessor, Samantha Power, never bothered with: the United States will not allow the UN to be hijacked by allies of Palestinian terror organizations, or allow it to continue ignoring the seemingly endless transgressions of North Korea, or allow the Russian government to flex its diplomatic muscle to silence its critics in the Security Council.

In doing so, Haley has shattered several myths about the Trump administration, namely, that Trump would take on a permissive international posture towards Russia and abandon South Korea and Japan to fend for themselves against their Communist neighbors. She has also reassured critics who feared that being the chief executive of a state offered her little relevant experience to navigate such a high-level diplomatic job.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15accf6a27e:2a25ac:c9473c70</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Monday, on “PBS NewsHour,” while discussing President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt saying carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to climate change, environmental activist former Vice President Al Gore said, “We’re seeing every night on the television news now a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.”

Gore said, “[T]hat’s a perfect example of a problem I’m describing in ‘The Assault on Reason.’ Again, at some point, a false belief collides with physical reality. We are seeing every night on the television news now a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. These climate-related extreme weather events have convinced the vast majority of people that the scientists have been right for a long time. We have to address this. But putting someone in the EPA who denies even the most basic scientific truth about this — you know, it’s the old cliches are, you can say the earth is flat, but doesn’t mean you’re going to fall off the edge.”

President Donald Trump will unveil his budget proposals later this week, which is likely to include the cutting of government bureaucrats at levels not seen since the end of the Second World War, according to budget analysts.

The budget, which will be released on Thursday, is expected to drastically decrease the size of government, cutting jobs in sectors such as housing, foreign aid, and environmental protection — and instead prioritizing areas such as the military and homeland security.

According to an analysis conducted by Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, Trump’s plans could reduce employment in the capital by 1.8 per cent and average personal income by 3.5 per cent, as well as reducing house prices by 1.9 per cent.

During his presidential campaign, Trump promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington D.C. by eliminating corruption and reforming the federal government.

Trump also promised to introduce a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal workforce through a process of attrition, with the exemption of the military, public safety, and public health.

On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at reducing government waste, telling reporters that the order will lead to a “thorough examination of every executive department and agency” to establish “where money is being wasted [and] how services can be improved.”

In January, House Republicans also voted to reinstate the Holman Rule, which scraps the minimum wage for government workers, meaning they can be paid as little as $1, making it easier to cut federal bureaucracy.

However, the majority of cuts will need to be passed through Congress, with Democrats are already forming opposition to Trump’s plans. Former vice-presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) recently said in an interview that “the notion of bulking up defense but slashing everything else, that’s not going to find any votes on the Democratic side.”

Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February, Trump’s senior advisor Steve Bannon said a key aspect of the administration’s agenda would be the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”

“The way the progressive left runs is that if they can’t get it passed, they’re just going to put it in some sort of regulation in an agency,” he said. “That’s all going to be deconstructed.”

According to a report by the Washington Post, an “anonymous environmental activist collective” decided to vandalize the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA over President Donald Trump’s “blatant disregard” for the environment.

The group snuck into the golf course Sunday morning and carved the words “NO MORE TIGERS. NO MORE WOODS.”

“In response to the president’s recent decision to gut our existing protection policies, direct action was conceived and executed on the green of his California golf course in the form of a simple message: NO MORE TIGERS. NO MORE WOODS,” the group said in a statement released to the Post.

A member of the environmentalist group told the paper that the six-feet tall letters were carved into the green using gardening tools.

“Tearing up the golf course felt justified in many ways,” a group member told the Washington Post. “Repurposing what was once a beautiful stretch of land into a playground for the privileged is an environmental crime in its own right.”

The member added, “We hope this sends a message to Trump and his corrupt administration that their actions will be met with action.”

A group of House Democrats introduced a resolution Monday that slams President Trump and calls him out for “fake news” and false statements.

New York Democratic Rep. Adriano Espaillat introduced House Resolution 191, which purports to “oppose fake news and alternative facts.”

While attacking “lies” and “fake news,” the Democrats’ resolution itself makes several untrue statements.

The language claims Trump and the White House have “blocked” news organizations reporting on “President Trump’s collaboration with Russia.” The resolution also states that the United States is “a democracy, not an autocracy,” even though it is a representative democracy in which the people indirectly rule via their elected leaders.

The document goes on to give several instances of what its author claims are lies and “fake news” issued by the president and members of his administration, including the flap over the size of Trump’s inauguration day crowd.

Misreported by The Hill newspaper as a “bill” and “legislation,” Espaillat’s effort is only a resolution. There is little chance that the stunt will result in acceptance by anything approaching a majority of the House of Representatives.

Even if passed, H. Res. 191 would only express a sentiment of a majority of congressmen and would carry no force of law.

Democrat representatives Ted Lieu of California and Georgia’s John Lewis cosponsored the resolution.

Senate Democrats are apparently pushing ahead with their proposal to cripple President Donald Trump’s presidency by blocking his campaign promise to build a secure border wall between the United States and Mexico’s drug runners, criminals and illegal immigrants.

The threat, leaked in early March, was made clear in a letter from Democratic leaders in the Senate, who said they were “concerned with reports that there may be an effort to include funding for a very expensive border wall” in a special budget planned for early 2017.

“We believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump’s Administration,” said the letter, which was signed by the Democrats’ Senate leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer, and other Democratic leaders, including Democrat Sens. Dick Durbin, Sen. Patty Murray, Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Sen. Patrick Leahy.

The letter was shared with a variety of media outlets before it was sent to the GOP leaders, including Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnnell.

The letter also sought to protect other progressive priorities from Trump’s budget cutting and policy changes, by saying Democrats would oppose any funding changes that would:

roll back protections for our veterans, environment, consumers, and workers and prohibit funds for critical healthcare services for women through Planned Parenthood. We strongly oppose the inclusion of such riders in any of the must-pass appropriations bills that fund the government.

The Democrats have some leverage over the GOP in the Senate because they can block legislation unless eight of the 48 Democratic Senators vote with the GOP to end a debate and schedule voting on a pending bill.

In turn, the GOP has enormous leverage on Democrats, because they can blame the Democrats for blocking a federal budget and for obstructing an elected president.

The GOP is already in a very good position to add several additional Senate seats in the 2018 elections to their 52-seat majority. For example, 10 Democrats Senators in states that voted for Trump in 2016 have to face the voters in November 2018, while only one GOP Senator is facing election in a state won by Hillary Clinton. If the GOP gains only five seats in 2018, it will have just three votes short of a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate.

Numerous polls show that strong majorities of Americans want to reduce the flow of drugs, preserve U.S. jobs for Americans and also want Congress to pass laws that help Americans. In 2006, Congress passed a law authorizing — but not funding — the construction of a border wall.

Also, Schumer’s last big strategic decision — his championship of the cheap-labor “Gang of Eight” amnesty in 2013 — backfired spectacularly once GOP politicians recognized the business-funded pro-amnesty polls were hiding the public’s strong anti-amnesty attitudes. Schumer believed the flawed pro-amnesty polls, so Democrats lost nine seats in the 2014 election, the GOP’s base backed pro-American Donald Trump in the 2016 primaries, and Democratic voters dismantled their own party’s “Blue Wall” in the Midwest states on November 8, making Schumer the second-biggest loser of the night.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15acb21efba:6c6fad:e843be78</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Michael Crowley writes in Politico Magazine about the fear among Europe’s elites that President Trump and his chief strategist Steve Bannon pose an existential threat to the future of the European Union.

Trump and Bannon’s championing of Brexit and their distrust of globalist bureaucracies have set off alarm bells among the elites in Brussels. To Bannon, Crowley writes, “a strengthened EU is nothing less than a risk to civilization: a body that dilutes national identity and whose border policies allow Islam to invade the West, one refugee at a time.”

This EU antipathy, combined with the Trump administration’s signaling of their desire for bilateral trade agreements, could spell doom for the already weakened EU.

From Politico:

The idea that one man could threaten the European project might sound extreme. And it would be an exaggeration to say that even the full-throated support of Breitbart London was what tipped the scales toward Brexit. But having the ear of the president of the United States is different—and the question of just what Bannon plans to do with his influence has become a huge preoccupation of diplomats, European government officials and experts on the venerable trans-Atlantic relationship. In more than a dozen interviews, they recounted a creeping sense of dread about the very specific ways Bannon could use American power like a crowbar to pull the EU apart.

…

Since the election, European officials have been combing the internet, including Breitbart’s archives, for clues to Bannon’s worldview and how he might counsel Trump. And what they’re finding is stoking their deepest anxieties. “They have a deep well of psychological reliance on the American-led order,” says Jeremy Shapiro, a Hillary Clinton State Department official now at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. Now they’re bracing for an American assault on that order.

Europe as we know it has never been more vulnerable to such an assault. Economic malaise and high debt are testing the EU’s financial structures and pitting its members against one another. So is the historic influx of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa. Nationalist parties and candidates hostile to the Union are ascendant in France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands—all of which are set to hold elections this year. Russia, which may stand to gain the most from a disunited Europe, is gleefully aiding the process by disrupting Europe’s domestic politics with propaganda and hacking meant to discredit the pro-EU establishment.

…

“For an American administration, breaking up the EU is like falling off a log. The majority of EU countries value their relationship with the U.S. more than they do with the EU, and are readily open to American requests that would even run counter to the letter of their European obligations,” Jeremy Shapiro says. That might apply to issues beyond trade, he says, speculating that Trump could roil EU members by rewarding some and punishing others with tax and immigration policies. “It’s trivially easy,” Shapiro says. “If you differentiated between countries, you could create a lot of damaging tension within the EU.”

WASHINGTON – Navy officials are looking into how to boost industrial capacity to build more ships as the service looks to increase its fleet from 274 ships to 355 over the next 30 years.

“There’s efforts ongoing right now to see what we can do to ramp up in the industrial base where we can and start moving quickly to that 355 number for platforms that we know we’re going to need,” said Rear Adm. Jesse Wilson, Jr., director of the Navy’s Assessment Division at a recent congressional hearing on what the future Navy should look like.

The Navy released plans in December to grow the fleet to 355, and President Trump has called for a 350-fleet Navy, but executing the plan requires overcoming the challenge to the shipbuilding industry’s capacity to handle the additional growth.

Bryan Clark, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said at the hearing held by House Armed Services subcommittee on seapower and projection forces, that there would have to be some investments in shipyards to enable them to further increase production, particularly in Connecticut.

“They’re largely going to be maxed out in terms of their near-term industrial capacity with the Columbia class [submarines] and if we try to do two attack submarines,” he said at the March 8 hearing.

“But they have workforce limitations that are going to keep them from growing further. There are some facilities constraints that just over time that have grown and need to be addressed. So putting some money into facilities and a training infrastructures of the shipyards are going to be able to bring on the workforce they need to grow in order to start doing the construction at the rate that we would need to get to a 350-ship or so Navy,” he added.

Trump has proposed a $603 billion defense budget for 2018, but it is not clear whether defense hawks or Democrats are on board. The defense hawks oppose the $19 billion increase from the Obama administration’s proposed amount, and $54 billion over budget caps set in place in 2013, arguing it is too small. Democrats oppose increasing defense spending over those caps without also increasing non-defense spending.

Rep. Donald McEachin (D-VA) questioned how much of the $54 billion would go into shipbuilding, versus restoring battle readiness of the current fleet, which has accumulated shortfalls in maintenance and repair exacerbated by the budget caps, referred to as sequestration.

“Does any part of that $54 billion put us on track to get to that 355 ship level? Because I got a whole bunch of folks who are looking for work in Virginia’s 4th Congressional District and they get mighty excited. But I’m hearing things that say ‘We need to slow down. We’re not going to get there too quickly with that number,&apos;” he asked.

Wilson said the specific amounts are still unclear, but some of the money would go towards maintenance and restoring of the current fleet, while other sums would go towards building new ships.

Wilson’s deputy, Chuck Werchado, added that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has indicated his priority would be on first restoring readiness, then growing the Navy. However, he said, restoring readiness would still involve shipyards.

“I would just point out that a lot of restoring readiness means Norfolk Naval Shipyard because we do have to do the repairs to those ships to get them back out. So, I would expect a lot of the investment would be going to increase the rate of overhauls and the capacity to do overhauls,” he said.

Sunoy Banerjee, portfolio manager of naval research development test and evaluation for Mitre Corporation, agreed.

“The ship maintenance industrial base would benefit from some of this money going into readiness because right now, all of our surface combatants, all of our amphibious ships get maintained at private shipyards. There’s a bunch in Norfolk. There’s a bunch along the East Coast. And so, there’s a lot of workers that are going to be brought into to help with that because that’s where a lot of our expansion volume is if you will in the ship maintenance industrial base,” he said.

The subcommittee’s Chairman Rep. Rob Wittman (R-VA) said more information on how the Navy plans to increase its fleet size would be coming soon.

“We’ve asked the Congressional Budget Office to outline for us the pathway to get to 355 ships,” he said.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15acb21efba:6c6faa:e843be78</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” House Speaker Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) stated he was “pretty encouraged” by the CBO report on the American Health Care Act, although “I think they sort of overestimate the uninsured number, just like they overestimated who would be insured by Obamacare, but I do believe that if we’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want to buy, they won’t buy it, and that’s kind of obvious.”

Ryan said, “Well, actually, I think, if you read this entire report, I’m pretty encouraged by it. And it actually exceeded my expectations. Bret, Tom Price and Mick Mulvaney there mentioned the estimates before we’re that more, — 25 million people would be on Obamacare today. Less than half that are. But, look at what they said the reason why they think this uninsured would happen. We’re saying the government’s not going to force people to buy something that they don’t want to buy, and if we end an Obamacare mandate that says you must buy this government, one-size-fits-all, plan, guess what? People aren’t going to buy that. So, of course, they’re going to suggest that if we’re not going to make something people — make people do something they don’t want to do, they’re not going to do it. That’s really what’s behind this.”

He continued, “What I’m encouraged is, once our reforms kick in, what the CBO is telling us is, it’s going to lower premiums. It will lower premiums 10%. It stabilizes the market. It’s a $1.2 trillion spending cut, an $883 billion tax cut, and $337 billion in deficit reduction. So, of course, the CBO is going to say, if you’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want to buy, they won’t buy it. But, at the same time, they’re saying, our reforms will kick in, and lower premiums, and make healthcare, therefore more accessible.” Ryan also reiterated that the current bill is part one of a three-part plan.

Ryan stated that “[W]e’re doing a transition period, because we don’t want to pull the rug out from under anybody. We want to make sure that people can still have coverage and there’s a seamless transition, from a collapsing system, to a better system.”

He added, “I think they sort of overestimate the uninsured number, just like they overestimated who would be insured by Obamacare, but I do believe that if we’re not going to force people to buy something they don’t want to buy, they won’t buy it, and that’s kind of obvious.”

Ryan was asked about President Trump’s reference to the bill as a “beautiful negotiation.” He stated that the bill is a three-pronged approach that “fine-tuning touches” are being made to. He continued, “[We’re] working on getting that consensus among our members in the House and the Senate to make sure that we make this the best possible legislation. Now that we have this encouraging score from the CBO, this gives us even more room to work on, to make good, fine-tuning, finishing touches on this bill, as it moves through the four-committee process. … So, this is a good work in progress.”

On a never-before-released private October conference call with House Republican members, House Speaker Paul Ryan told his members in the U.S. House of Representatives he was abandoning then-GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump forever and would never defend him ever again.

In the Oct. 10, 2016 call, from right after the Access Hollywood tape of Trump was leaked in the weeks leading up to the election, Ryan does not specify that he will never defend Trump on just the Access Hollywood tape—he says clearly he is done with Trump altogether.

“I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future,” Ryan says in the audio, obtained by Breitbart News and published here for the first time ever.

Now, Ryan—still the Speaker—has pushed now President Donald Trump to believe his healthcare legislation the American Health Care Act would repeal and replace Obamacare when it does not repeal Obamacare. Ryan has also, according to Trump ally Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), misled President Trump into believing that Ryan’s bill can pass Congress. Paul and others believe the bill is dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate since a number of GOP senators have come out against it, and there are serious questions about whether it can pass the House. This is the first major initiative that Trump has worked on with Ryan—and the fact it is going so poorly calls into question whether Speaker Ryan, the GOP’s failed 2012 vice presidential nominee who barely supported Trump at all in 2016, really understands how Trump won and how to win in general.

The October conference call apparently was intended only for House Republican members. It’s unclear which or how many House Republicans took part in the call, whether the participants knew it was being recorded, who made the recording, or whether a recording exists of the entire call. The remarks on the portion provided to Breitbart News certainly sound like they were coming from Speaker Ryan, who seemed to be abandoning his party’s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election. He says not only will he not defend the Access Hollywood comments, but he will not campaign with Trump at all between this call on Oct. 10, 2016, and the general election for the presidency on Nov. 8—and that Ryan would not defend Trump on anything generally.

Ryan followed through on his promise to not campaign with Trump, abandoning the now president in the final crucial weeks leading up to the all-important general election. But Trump won anyway, in a landslide in the electoral college crushing Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton. This audio file means that Trump won all 306 of his electoral votes on his own, without Ryan, including the 10 he won in Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin. As soon as Trump won without Ryan’s help, Ryan aligned himself with then President-elect Trump and now President Trump—acting like he never abandoned him on the campaign trail and never disinvited the president from a rally in his district.

Ryan’s comments on this Oct. 10 call came after a female voice—it’s unclear if the woman was a House member or not—opened up the call. He called Trump’s Access Hollywood comments indefensible and said they do not fit with the Republican Party’s “principles and values.” Ryan also told House members on the call that he would not be campaigning with Trump, and that each member should make their own decision with regards to Trump over the next several weeks at that point: Abandon the GOP nominee for president like Ryan was doing or stand with him? A number of members joined Ryan in abandoning Trump. Both of those two sections of the call have been previously reported in media, although those media reports lacked audio of Ryan to back them up. But the more important line is the line where Ryan says—without specifying this was about the Access Hollywood leak—that he will never defend Donald Trump again.

“His comments are not anywhere in keeping with our party’s principles and values,” Ryan said. “There are basically two things that I want to make really clear, as for myself as your Speaker. I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future. As you probably heard, I disinvited him from my first congressional district GOP event this weekend—a thing I do every year. And I’m not going to be campaigning with him over the next 30 days.”

“Look, you guys know I have real concerns with our nominee,” Ryan continued. “I hope you appreciate that I’m doing what I think is best for you, the members, not what’s best for me. So, I want to do what’s best for our members, and I think this is the right thing to do. I’m going to focus my time on campaigning for House Republicans. I talked to a bunch of you over the last 72 hours and here is basically my takeaway. To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough reelections. Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you. And you all know what’s best for you where you are.”

Later in the audio, Ryan does clarify that the “last thing” he wanted to do was help Clinton ascend to the presidency.

“But the last thing I want to do is to help Hillary Clinton get the presidency, and get Congress,” Ryan said. “Look, she’s a failed progressive. She’s running an abysmal campaign. I mean, it’s just—it’s amazing how easily she could be beaten. She will take this country in the wrong direction. And the last thing we need is four more years of Obama policies or two years of a Clinton presidency with a Democrat Congress. Could you imagine what that would look like? So the last thing we want to be doing is giving Hillary Clinton a blank check in Congress.”

“That’s why I’m going to spend the rest of this month fighting for Congress, fighting for our majorities,” Ryan continued. “I’m going to spend the next 28 days working hard with all of our members to get re-elected because we need a check on Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump and Mike Pence don’t win the presidency. Greg Walden will get more into what that looks like and what polling looks like, but I want to basically close with this: His comments are indefensible, they’re not in keeping with our principles, so I’m not going to try to defend him. I’m going to focus on Congress, I’m going to focus on upholding our values. We have a great, great policy agenda—A Better Way—that we need to take to voters and show what our party actually stands for and what it’s stood for for generations.”

LISTEN TO AUDIO OF PAUL RYAN’S OCT. 10, 2016, CONFERENCE CALL WITH HOUSE GOP:

In response to this audio surfacing, Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck told Breitbart News: “The world is well aware of this history.”

“And obviously a lot has happened since then. As everyone knows,” Buck added in a follow-up email.

In a third follow-up email, Buck clarified about the comments from Ryan that “of course they were” specifically about the Access Hollywood tapes.

“This was in response to that, but as everyone knows, they came together toward the end of the campaign and the speaker vocally supported him and even campaigned with Pence,” Buck said.

But Ryan never campaigned with Trump.

It’s worth noting that the person Ryan leaned on for political advice in abandoning Trump during this conference call was now House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR). Walden, at the time, was chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). This audio file obtained by Breitbart News does not include Walden’s comments, so it’s unclear exactly what he said. But Walden is now one of Ryan’s top lieutenants in the House of Representatives, leading the promotion of this healthcare legislation—and one of the two committee chairmen who kept his committee in session overnight to speed up the mark-up of the legislation last week.

Ryan’s decision to abandon Trump on the campaign trail has become a focal point in healthcare negotiations. While meeting with conservative leaders last week at the White House, this exact topic came up—as Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Trump shared an exchange that was particularly awkward for White House chief of staff and Ryan ally Reince Priebus.

“Inside the Oval Office last week, there was a telling exchange between conservative activist Jenny Beth Martin and the president,” Jonathan Swan of Axios reported on Sunday night, adding:

During Trump’s Wednesday meeting with conservative leaders over the healthcare plan, Tea Party Patriots leader Martin subtly reminded Trump that her super-PAC stood by him ‘through thick and thin’ during the campaign, unlike a certain politician from Wisconsin. According to two sources in the room, Martin didn’t mention Paul Ryan’s name. But everyone knew who she was talking about. She reminded Trump that in October — when the crude ‘Access Hollywood’ tape leaked and Ryan disinvited Trump from a Wisconsin event — Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund volunteers were working the phones on Trump’s behalf. Trump smiled and glanced over at his chief of staff Reince Priebus. Trump said that, yes, he had been disinvited. And he thanked Martin for standing by him.

Ryan has been unwilling to negotiate on the specifics of his bill, which has earned multiple negative monikers like “Obamacare 2.0,” “Obamacare Lite,” “RyanCare,” and “RINO-CARE” from detractors. But President Trump and his true allies, despite what Ryan’s allies inside the White House say publicly, have been much more willing to negotiate, according to House and Senate conservatives who have had direct conversations with the president.

“We have gotten a signal from the White House that the bill might be completely pulled and a more transparent and inclusive process could start as early as next week,” one senior Republican Senate aide told Breitbart News on Friday. “House leadership misled the White House on how popular this bill would be with conservatives.”

“That would be excellent news, and the best way to ensure we actually deliver on what we told the voters we would do,” another senior congressional aide told Breitbart News when asked about the possibility Ryan’s bill might be pulled altogether and a new renegotiated bill introduced afterwards. “The bill as is cannot pass and there is a growing chorus of Republican members in both houses growing impatient with the current unwillingness to make any changes to the current House bill.”

“They’ll start to fold soon if the conservative groups hold firm,” one senior House GOP aide in an office whose member is against the bill, will not vote for it in its current form or without significant changes under any circumstances and is not in the House Freedom Caucus, told Breitbart News.

House GOP leadership offices—particularly Ryan’s and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s team—have not responded to requests for comment on the possibility the bill may be pulled altogether. But White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who is working internally as hard as he can to help Ryan on this front regardless of the impact on Trump along with a handful of other White House aides who came from the Republican National Committee and are not Trump loyalists, told Breitbart News that the idea the bill may be pulled is “false.”

But in conversations Breitbart News has had with no fewer than 15 other White House aides, including many on the press team, it is clear that the President and the senior Trump administration team are not happy with this bill’s lack of conservative support. The President and his team were assured by Ryan that conservatives would, in fact, be on board with it in the beginning, something that has turned out to not be accurate. Interestingly, much more so than Ryan and his House GOP leadership team, the White House is much more open to significant negotiation on the details in a healthcare bill—including the structure, vehicle, timeline and more. Several senior White House aides confirmed to Breitbart News that while the administration is publicly touting the bill as the party line, the President is much more willing to wheel and deal on this front than Ryan loyalists on his team would have anyone believe.

“The President gave Ryan a chance,” one source close to the President said. “If he doesn’t get his act together soon, the President will have no choice but to step in and fix this on his own. He’s the best negotiator on the planet, and if this were his bill not Ryan’s it would not be this much of a mess.”

In fact, the president himself on Monday said he is working on negotiating on this healthcare bill.

“We’re negotiating with everybody,” Trump said. “It’s a big fat beautiful negotiation and hopefully we’ll come up with something that’s going to be really terrific.”

What’s more, the bill has virtually zero chance of ever passing the Senate should it get there. Sens. Paul, Mike Lee (R-UT), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), James Lankford (R-OK), Dean Heller (R-NV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Ben Sasse (R-NE)—among other GOP senators—have all raised concerns about it. Paul, Lee and Cotton have been particularly vocal, while Graham has raised concerns with the process.

Cotton, particularly, warned his old House colleagues to not vote for Ryan’s bill. “The bill probably can be fixed, but it’s going to take a lot of carpentry on that framework,” Cotton said, adding the key warning: “Do not walk the plank and vote for a bill that cannot pass the Senate and then have to face the consequences of that vote,”

“I’m not going to give into demands by members of Congress or the Senate if I don’t believe it’s in the interest of the American people and just walk away from the frigging table,” Graham said last week, according to Politico.

Sasse, meanwhile, has privately raised concerns about the process and viability of the bill, according to a Senate GOP aide while a source close to Sasse has confirmed to Breitbart News he raised those concerns. Politico has reported on Heller’s serious concerns with Ryan’s bill, and Collins said she agrees with Paul—for different reasons—that the bill is dead on arrival in the Senate. Lankford, in a Monday morning radio interview, confirmed he also has serious concerns with the House bill and that he is introducing his own Obamacare replacement legislation in the Senate on Tuesday.

Cruz’s office confirmed to Breitbart News he has had several meetings with White House officials, House members and Senate leadership officials making the case for an improved House bill. Cruz has also argued that Republicans can get around the Senate’s parliamentarian on budget reconciliation because he says the Vice President—Mike Pence—“has the statutory and constitutional authority (as does the Senate majority) to rule to the contrary” of what the parliamentarian says.

Given the fact there are only 52 Republicans in the U.S. Senate, only three Republicans are needed to stop a piece of legislation that has no support from any Democrats. This bill is expected to get no support from Democrats, so the nine Republicans that Breitbart News can confirm have serious issues with the House bill—while not all necessarily 100 percent against it—are more than enough to stop this bill dead in its tracks if it ever reaches them.

That brings up the next question, which is whether Ryan’s legislation has enough support to pass the U.S. House of Representatives. At this time, since the House Freedom Caucus is united against it—more than 40 members comprise the House Freedom Caucus—it appears the answer is no. Ryan can only afford to lose around 20 Republican votes, depending on absences and vacancies, since he is aiming to pass the bill with zero support from any Democrats.

And while Ryan is attempting to browbeat 20 or so of the House Freedom Caucus members into submission on this legislation using his affiliated outside groups to run ads against them in their districts—while not spending anything on targeting Democrats—House GOP sources in non-Freedom Caucus offices tell Breitbart News that there are as many as perhaps 70 House Republicans against this bill at this time, and that number is not getting any smaller as time goes by. So if Ryan is able to muscle it through the House in the next few weeks—sources close to the process expect a battle to come on the rule vote, which may happen next week or the week after—it will be on life support headed to a Senate that does not support it since conservatives are not warming up to it by any stretch.

Now, on top of all of this, this new audio file raises questions as to how loyal Ryan is to Trump politically—and is asking the new president to use precious political capital to push through legislation that seems arithmetically destined for congressional failure. That could doom or at least dampen other key elements of the Trump agenda, like tax reform, immigration reform, national security efforts, budgetary reforms, building up of the U.S. military, trade renegotiation and more.

As such, as Breitbart News has previously reported, there are now rumblings among House Republicans that they may want a replacement not just of Obamacare but a replacement of Paul Ryan as Speaker. A new Speaker, some argue, would make life much easier for President Trump as he moves forward with his agenda. So the argument goes, as some House GOP members have told Breitbart News, is that if healthcare is this rocky then tax reform, immigration, trade policy and other key Trump agenda items will be worse.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15acacf42fa:7b05ba:ebf7d7d1</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

In an interview with China’s Phoenix TV transcribed by Syria’s SANA News, President Bashar Assad complained about foreign “invaders” operating on Syrian soil without his permission and said that while he hopes for cooperation with the new U.S. administration, he has not communicated with President Donald Trump yet.

Assad maintained his long-standing position that most opposition groups are “terrorists” without legitimacy. He suggested that peace talks will not be productive until terrorists, people with “good intentions” who do not really represent anyone, and proxies for foreign powers like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United States are removed from the process.

The Syrian dictator put forth an offer to “terrorists” who might be able to shed that designation by showing proper respect to his regime: “Even those people who are terrorists or belonging to the terrorists or to other countries, they may change their mind and go back to their normality by going back to being real Syrians, detach themselves from being terrorists or agents to other groups.”

Peace talks in Geneva and Astana have been floundering because they cannot get past arguments over who should be sitting at the table. On Monday, several rebel groups announced they would not send representatives to the next round of talks in Kazakhstan due to what one spokesman described as “unfulfilled pledges related to the cessation of hostilities” – in other words, the Syrian government keeps bombing them while a “cease-fire” is supposedly in effect.

The latest round of talks in Geneva became mired in procedural issues and hindered by the absence of American leadership. Russia, Syria, and Iran muscled the U.S. into an observer-only role after the collapse of President Obama’s Syria policy, symbolized by the fall of the rebel stronghold in Aleppo, and President Trump has yet to declare a new policy or seek a more prominent role at the talks.

The Washington Post speculates that all parties are waiting to find out where the new U.S. administration will come down on the Syria question, with both sides finding encouragement in what the Post describes as “President Trump’s often contradictory statements on the Middle East.”

A more optimistic observer of Trump’s strategy might wonder if he is deliberately allowing the Russia-dominated talks to curdle without American involvement, so an American presence is more welcomed and respected when the new administration steps back in. Also, one can hardly blame anyone in the Trump administration for being reluctant to wade back into the Syrian quagmire.

Indeed, the Washington Post notes that “the opposition delegation has sought to be on its best behavior” and promised to refrain from walkouts precisely because it wants to “show Mr. Trump we are serious about a relationship, about a political solution and about limiting the role of Iran,” as a member of the delegation put it. It sounds as if a little strategic ambiguity was exactly what the situation needed.

Of course, that won’t last. In his interview with Phoenix TV, Assad cited Trump’s comments about prioritizing the destruction of the Islamic State and expressed eagerness to participate in that program:

I said since the beginning that this is a promising approach to what’s happening in Syria and in Iraq, because we live in the same area and we face the same enemy. We haven’t seen anything concrete yet regarding this rhetoric, because we’ve been seeing now certain is a local kind of raids. You cannot deal with terrorism on local basis; it should be comprehensive, it cannot be partial or temporary. It cannot be from the air, it should be in cooperation with the troops on the ground, that’s why the Russians succeeded, since they supported the Syrian Army in pushing ISIS to shrink, not to expand as it used to be before that. So, we have hopes that this taking into consideration that talking about ISIS doesn’t mean talking about the whole terrorism; ISIS is one of the products, al-Nusra is another product, you have so many groups in Syria, they are not ISIS, but they are Al Qaeda, they have the same background of the Wahabi extremist ideology.

As in other interviews over the past few years, Assad stressed the Russian-Syrian view that fighting “terrorists” in concert with the Syrian government should be the goal of the Western world, and reluctance to accept this reality has unnecessarily prolonged the Syrian civil war. He is right about the extent of al-Qaeda influence in Syria; some of the most effective fighting forces in the rebellion are either elements of al-Qaeda or allied with it. If the West joined forces with Damascus, Moscow, and Tehran to stamp out Sunni Wahabbist extremism in Syria, there would not be much of a rebellion left. Assad is serenely confident of his ability to win any “referendum” put before the “Syrian people,” as he said once again in this latest interview.

Assad even lashed out at the White Helmets, a celebrated group of volunteer rescue workers in Syrian war zones who were lauded in an Academy Award-winning documentary film on Netflix. Assad denounced the film as propaganda and congratulated al-Qaeda for winning an Oscar.

“This is unbelievable, and this is another proof that the Oscars, Nobel, all these things are politicized certificates, that’s how I can look at it,” he sneered. “The White Helmets story is very simple; it is a facelift of al-Nusra Front in Syria, just to change their ugly face into a more humanitarian face, that’s it. And you have many videos on the net and of course images broadcasted by the White Helmets that condemn the White Helmets as a terrorist group, where you can see the same person wearing the white helmet and celebrating over the dead bodies of Syrian soldiers.”

When the Chinese interviewer asked Assad if he had any “personal contact with the President of the United States,” he replied, “not at all.” He made vague mention of “indirect channels” but said they were no substitute for formal communication.

Assad had nothing good to say about U.S. and Turkish forces operating in Syria. He said Turkey “has been supporting ISIS until this moment,” and working with al-Qaeda’s Nusra Front “because Erdogan, the Turkish president, is Muslim Brotherhood.”

Assad then accused the United States of turning a blind eye to Turkey’s indulgence of ISIS under the Obama administration and praised Russia as the only foreign power willing to take the threat of the Islamic State seriously.

“I think the Russians have hope that the two parties join the Russians and the Syrians in their fight against terrorism,” said Assad, referring to the U.S. and Turkey. “So, we have more hopes now regarding the American party because of the new administration, while in Turkey nothing has changed in that regard. ISIS in the north have only one route of supply, it’s through Turkey, and they’re still alive and they’re still active and they’re still resisting different kinds of waves of attacks, because of the Turkish support.”

The Syrian dictator was strongly critical of U.S. troop deployments near Manbij, stating that his government did not invite American forces. “Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation or consultation or permission, they are invaders, whether they are American, Turkish, or any other one,” he said.

“What are they going to do? To fight ISIS? The Americans lost nearly every war. They lost in Iraq, they had to withdraw at the end. Even in Somalia, let alone Vietnam in the past and Afghanistan, your neighboring country. They didn’t succeed anywhere they sent troops, they only create a mess; they are very good in creating problems and destroying, but they are very bad in finding solutions,” Assad complained, apparently forgetting his previously stated goal of sweet-talking the Trump administration into working with Damascus against all the “terrorists” opposing his rule.

He praised China and Russia for blocking U.N. human rights sanctions against Syria and eagerly anticipated Chinese investment in Syrian reconstruction. He said China also has a terrorist-fighting interest in his country due to extremist Muslim Uighurs from China flowing into Syria through Turkey, which he once again lambasted for its poor border security. Assad went so far as accusing Turkey of deliberately organizing the Uighurs, who were “gathered and collected in one group” and sending them into Syria to wreak havoc.

The Chinese interview wrapped up with a soft-focus praise for Assad as a “loving husband and father of three,” as the interviewer called him.

“If you cannot succeed in your small duty which is your family, you cannot succeed in your bigger duty or more comprehensive duty at the level of a country,” said Assad. He made a point of praising his son Kareem for trying to learn Chinese, because “China is a rising power” and has proved “it’s a real friend, a friend that you can rely on.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aca982ddb:767a24:ebf7d7d1</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) report on the House Republicans’ healthcare plan says the included provision to defund Planned Parenthood would result in “additional births stemming from the reduced access” to “services that help women avert pregnancies.”

GOPcare&apos;s ban on Planned Parenthood would result in loss of healthcare to many in rural/low income areas; thousands of births would result. — Cathleen Decker (@cathleendecker) March 13, 2017

The CBO report states:

To the extent that there would be reductions in access to care under the legislation, they would affect services that help women avert pregnancies. The people most likely to experience reduced access to care would probably reside in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations. CBO projects that about 15 percent of those people would lose access to care. The government would incur some costs for Medicaid beneficiaries currently served by affected entities because the costs of about 45 percent of all births are paid for by the Medicaid program. CBO estimates that the additional births stemming from the reduced access under the legislation would add to federal spending for Medicaid. In addition, some of those children would themselves qualify for Medicaid and possibly for other federal programs.

However, if more Americans currently on Obamacare’s expanded Medicaid become employed, it is likely fewer Americans would be having the medical costs associated with their babies’ births paid for by fellow taxpayers.

The Republican plan calls for the elimination of federal funding for the nation’s largest abortion business for a period of one year. CBO estimates the provision would reduce direct spending by $178 million in 2017 and by $234 million between 2017-2026.

CBO expects during the one-year period in which Planned Parenthood receives no federal funding, “The number of births in the Medicaid program would increase by several thousand, increasing direct spending for Medicaid by $21 million in 2017 and by $77 million over the 2017-2026 period.”

Vice President Mike Pence met last week with pro-life leaders and assured them the final healthcare proposal would protect the sanctity of human life.

Also last week, President Donald Trump informed Planned Parenthood it would have to quit performing abortions in order to keep its federal taxpayer funding.

Planned Parenthood’s executive vice president Dawn Laguens responded in an op-ed at Marie Claire with the claim that the White House “tried to pressure us to stop providing abortions.”

Laguens said:

Our response is short and simple: No way. Providing safe and legal abortion is central to our mission of giving all people the care and information they need to make their own decisions. Abortion is a legal right and a health care service that should not be shamed or stigmatized by politicians, especially since 1 in 3 women in this country will have one at some point in her life.

Similarly, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards tweeted, that abortion is “equally vital to our mission.”

Planned Parenthood is proud to provide abortion—a necessary service that’s as vital to our mission as birth control or cancer screenings. https://t.co/TWGOcVjBJ4 — Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 6, 2017

David Daleiden, producer of the undercover videos that alleged Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted babies for a profit, reacted to Breitbart News saying, “Abortion is equally ‘vital to our mission’ as birth control or cancer screening. So much for ‘only 3%,’” — referring to Planned Parenthood’s common claim that abortion is only three percent of its total activities.

The Washington Examiner also concludes, “[I]t seems abortion is more important to Planned Parenthood than the other 97 percent of services it provides.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aca7ca02e:702e9e:d3e451e7</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump continued to back the House bill to replace Obamacare, despite conservative critics in Congress who oppose the bill.

“This is the time we’re going to get it done, we’re working together, we have some great results, we have tremendous spirit and I think it’s something that’s just going to happen very shortly,” Trump said, speaking to reporters after meeting with lawmakers at the White House on Friday morning.

Trump read from prepared remarks during the statement, praising the bill drafted by Speaker Paul Ryan and House leadership.

“The House repeal and replace plan ends the Obamacare tax hikes … it eliminates the Obamacare mandate that forces Americans to approve government approved plans,” he said.

The president also praised the bill for providing states flexibility to spend Medicaid funds and allowed Americans to purchase a healthcare plan of their choice.

Sen. Tom Cotton, Sen. Mike Lee, and Sen. Rand Paul have all voiced criticisms of the bill, arguing that it is “Obamacare Lite” or “Obamacare 2.0” and that the House is moving too quickly to pass it. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have signaled dissent towards the bill, demanding that leadership restart the process or make serious changes. Other conservative critics of the bill argue that the bill does not fully repeal Obamacare, keeping most provisions active until 2020.

Trump met with Vice President Mike Pence and the heads of congressional committees, Rep. Diane Black, Rep. Kevin Brady, Rep. Greg Walden, Rep. Virginia Foxx, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte.

He also spent time talking about the looming “disaster” that was Obamacare, emphasizing the importance of speed as they moved forward.

“I think it’s going to be something that happens very shortly,” Trump concluded. “Thank you all very much and we’re going to get to work.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15aca7ca02e:702e9b:d3e451e7</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

This year’s SXSW festival is taking on President Trump, according to The Hill, which reported that the proceedings largely focused on negative rhetoric against the president.

“The centerpiece of the panel discussions is a series titled ‘Tech Under Trump,’” reported The Hill on Saturday, adding that the panel discussions “aren’t pulling any punches.”

“NPR reporter Sam Sanders is hosting an event titled the ‘2016 Election: How We Got it Wrong!,’ reflecting on his experiences covering the 2016 presidential race,” they continued. “Another discussion titled ‘Building Bridges When Others Want to Build Walls,’ is intended to highlight the uncertainty facing immigrants. One panel is discussing ‘From Trump to Trolls: How Muslim Media Fights Back.&apos;”

“Some of the panels aren’t Trump-focused, but do highlight the tech industry’s policy priorities, including a discussion titled ‘Can You Hear Me Now? The Rural Broadband Debate,’ featuring Rep. Vicente González (D-Texas) and Information Technology Industry Council President Dean Garfield,” The Hill concluded. “Even the festival’s art and music events are taking on a stronger political tone than in years past. One music showcase is titled ‘Contrabanned,’ and will feature acts from countries including Libya and Somalia, whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. under Trump’s travel executive order.”

“I’ve never seen in my lifetime an atmosphere of fear as I’ve seen now,” said Sen. Cory Booker at the festival. “I feel a sense of pain about my country right now.

“[Trump] isn’t backing away from his rhetoric. But if we don’t engage, we are the source of the problem, not the elected person we don’t like,” he added.

In a SXSW session titled “Dark Days: AI and the Rise of Fascism,” Microsoft’s Kate Crawford even attempted to compare the rise of artificial intelligence with fascism.

“Just as we are seeing a step function increase in the spread of AI, something else is happening: the rise of ultra-nationalism, rightwing authoritarianism and fascism,” Crawford declared. “We should always be suspicious when machine learning systems are described as free from bias if it’s been trained on human-generated data. Our biases are built into that training data.”

SXSW’s chief programming officer Hugh Forrest praised the political slant on this year’s festival.

“There is definitely a degree of politics or political focus that may not have been there in previous years,” said Forrest. “We hope people walk away with a little better understanding of issues and the players driving the issues.”

Forrest, who voted for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, previously claimed to be “grieving” following President Trump’s victory in November. He also claimed to be excited about SXSW’s “role” in “paving a more progressive path to the future.”

While discussing President Donald Trump’s tweets accusing former President Obama’s administration of wiretapping Trump Tower prior to the election on Monday’s edition of CNN’s “The Lead With Jake Tapper,” Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) said, “I think a 9/11 independent type commission” should investigate President Trump.

Menendez said, “I’m for an independent commission. And I think we have the master of misdirection in the White House, evident — the suggestion that President Obama wiretapped him, and then, takes off the attention on what was happening with Russia and the attorney general and others. So, I’m for an independent commission. I think that’s the only way, across the entire spectrum. I respect the Intelligence Committee and our leadership on a bipartisan basis. but that’s one element of a much broader set of circumstances. I want to make sure that when President Trump is acting, he’s acting in the interests of the American people, not in any interests he might have. And that’s broader than the intelligence elements, broader than the whole issue of our elections. It’s a whole host of issues. And I think a 9/11 independent type commission should do it.”

President Donald Trump told reporters that a “big fat beautiful negotiation” was underway on the proposed house health care bill, after a growing number of conservatives have voiced dissent with the effort.

“We’re negotiating with everybody,” Trump said. “It’s a big fat beautiful negotiation and hopefully we’ll come up with something that’s going to be really terrific.”

Trump made his remarks during a meeting with his cabinet at the White House — although four of them have yet to be confirmed by the Senate.

During remarks to reporters, Trump thanked Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for working “around the clock” on the effort to replace the Obamacare bill.

“I think that ultimately the big beneficiary will be the American people,” Trump said.

A handful of Republican Senators have signaled that they will not support the bill, raising questions about the bill’s ability to pass. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have also signaled that they will not vote for the bill as it currently stands.

Trump spent the morning meeting with Americans affected by skyrocketing premiums, higher deductibles, and less coverage from Obamacare.

“It’s not okay, it’s a disaster, and people understand that. It’s failed and it’s imploding,” Trump said, adding that if it was allowed to continue, it would “doubly implode.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac9a005da:5b7fdb:d3e451e7</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Obama administration spent more than $77 million to promote Obamacare in 2016, the New York Post reported.

Contracts obtained by the Post show that the federal government had a contract with Democratic-leaning PR firm Weber Shandwick, where the government paid the firm $74.15 million on July 28, 2016, and an additional $3.69 million on September 9, 2016, to promote the plan.

Of that money, $64 million went to radio, television, and digital advertisements; $4 million went to creative development and production; $5 million to direct response marketing; $2 million to campaign strategy; $1 million to branding; and $1.5 million to encourage small business enrollment.

An official from the Trump administration dismissed the efforts of the Obama administration to make a last-ditch effort to boost enrollment.

“Tens of millions in hard-earned taxpayer funds spent on TV ads won’t sell a fundamentally flawed approach to health care,” the official told the Post.

Pam Jenkins, president of Weber Shandwick, signed the contract. Obama selected the firm’s chairman, Jack Leslie, to be chairman of the U.S. African Development Foundation.

Leslie donated $1,000 to former President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign and $2,700 to Hillary Clinton’s failed presidential bid.

On Monday, President Trump met with nine people who have suffered from the healthcare law’s high costs, telling them that he would put in its place a better plan that would “lower costs” and “expand choice.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Sunday that “nobody would be worse off financially” if Republicans in Congress made an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare with the House replacement plan.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac9a005da:5b7fd9:d3e451e7</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump hosted a listening session at the White House to highlight the problems with Obamacare, as Americans continue to suffer from higher insurance premiums, higher deductibles and less coverage.

The president met nine American citizens Monday who were suffering the financial effects of what he described as the “very, very, failed and failing Obamacare law.”

Trump told the group that he would put into place a better plan that “lowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone” and promised “more competition and less regulation” in the market place.

“You’ll see rates go down, down, down, and you’ll see plans go up, up, up, you’ll have a lot of choices,” he said.

Trump admitted that it would take a few years to fully fix the insurance marketplace, but promised that it would be “a thing of beauty” when completed. He was critical of the media for reporting that Obamacare was doing well.

“It’s a little bit like President Obama, when he left people like him, when he was here, people didn’t like him so much. That’s the way life goes, that’s human nature.”

Trump said that Republicans were in bad position politically by trying to repeal Obamacare, when it would be easier to let it collapse entirely.

“The press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden,” he said, predicting disastrous results for the law in 2017.

Carrie Couey, a cattle rancher from Colorado explained that her rates under Obamacare were three times the rates and that multiple insurers had dropped their coverage.

“Millions of people had great health care that they loved,” Trump said.

Brittany Ivey of George said her private insurance rates went up 110 percent, and that even though she was paying $1300 a month for a plan, her doctors wouldn’t take the insurance.

“We’re so happy to be seeing it going,” she said. “It’s almost put our family in financial ruin.”

Elias Seife, Florida, an attorney from Florida, said that their insurance had changed every year since Obamacare was put into place, noting that they had a daughter with a disability.

“I think the real scenario was that this law was supposed to implode … my parents came from communist Cuba, they know what socialism is all about, so I know what socialism is and that’s pretty much what this whole system was meant to have one single provider,” Seife said.

Kim Sertich from Arizona told the president that the 116 percent increases reported in her state were very real, explaining that she lost her plan three times before opting out of getting health care all together.

A nurse from Wisconsin, Gina Sell, said that she was forced to take a full time job and more time away from her family after

One man, Greg Knox of Ohio, gave the president a cutout card of his face with a note that was created by his 11-year-old son.

During a listening session on healthcare at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump said Republicans “are putting themselves in a very bad position…by repealing Obamacare.”

Trump said that his administration is “committed to repealing and replacing” Obamacare and that the House Obamacare replacement will lead to more choice at a lower cost. He further stated, “[T]he press is making Obamacare look so good all, of a sudden. I’m watching the news. It looks so good. They’re showing these reports about this one gets so much, and this one gets so much. First of all, it covers very few people, and it’s imploding. And ’17 will be the worst year. And I said it once; I’ll say it again: because Obama’s gone.”

He continued, “And the Republicans, frankly, are putting themselves in a very bad position — I tell this to Tom Price all the time — by repealing Obamacare. Because people aren’t gonna see the truly devastating effects of Obamacare. They’re not gonna see the devastation. In ’17 and ’18 and ’19, it’ll be gone by then. It’ll — whether we do it or not, it’ll be imploded off the map.”

He added, “So, the press is making it look so wonderful, so that if we end it, everyone’s going to say, ‘Oh, remember how great Obamacare used to be? Remember how wonderful it used to be? It was so great.’ It’s a little bit like President Obama. When he left, people liked him. When he was here, people didn’t like him so much. That’s the way life goes. That’s human nature.”

Trump further stated that while letting Obamacare collapse on its own was the best thing to do politically, it wasn’t the right thing to do for the country.

On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox &amp; Friends,” Counselor to President Trump Kellyanne Conway stated of the proposed Obamacare repeal and replacement, “The president and the vice president have leaned into this legislation, and the president did what leaders do this week. He listened. He’s negotiating. But he’s also the ultimate decision maker and deal maker.”

Conway said, “The president and the vice president have leaned into this legislation, and the president did what leaders do this week. He listened. He’s negotiating. But he’s also the ultimate decision maker and deal maker.”

She added, “[W]hat the president has said is that if you have good improvements to the bill, let’s hear them. And just this past week, Brian, he had leaders of the grassroots movement in, who represent millions of people who are concerned about healthcare. He had 35 of the whips in. Vice President Pence is up on Capitol Hill, at a lunch with the Republican senators, talking about healthcare. The president had dinner with Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).

The Thomas More Law Center filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of the Tennessee General Assembly and the State of Tennessee in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee on Monday challenging the federal refugee resettlement program for violating the state’s sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The lawsuit places Tennessee at the center of the national debate concerning the operation of the federal refugee resettlement program.

President Trump will be holding a rally in Nashville on Wednesday to garner public support for his agenda. His revised Executive Order 13780 temporarily halting the federal refugee resettlement program and temporarily banning travel from six Middle Eastern countries goes into effect on Thursday.

As a national non-profit public interest law firm, the Thomas More Law Center, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan will represent Tennessee without charge.

In April 2016, the Tennessee General Assembly passed SJR 467 by overwhelming majorities authorizing the filing of a lawsuit to address the federal government’s commandeering of state funds to continue the refugee resettlement program in Tennessee. In 2007, the state of Tennessee officially withdrew from the federal program but the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement unilaterally designated Catholic Charities of Tennessee to force continued use of state funds to resettle refugees in the state.

The federal government is prohibited from forcing states to support federal programs with state revenues. This issue of federal funding for the new, soon-to-be created federal program, was addressed by the late Senator Ted Kennedy, the chief sponsor of the Refugee Act of 1980, the enabling legislation, on the Senate floor prior to its passage:

“… the committee was mindful of the deep concern of many State and local agencies that Federal assistance authorized under these programs should be for a reasonable period of time – to assure that local communities will not be taxed for a program they did not initiate.”

The Refugee Act specified that 100 percent of each state’s cost of Medicaid and cash welfare benefits provided to each resettled refugee during their first 36 months in the United State would be reimbursed to each state by the federal government. However, within five years of having created the federal program, Congress failed to appropriate sufficient funding and instead, costs of the federal program began shifting to state governments.

Within ten years of passing the Refugee Act, the federal government eliminated all reimbursement of state costs, a huge financial cost to the states that was, in effect, yet another unfunded federal mandate.

The cost shifting to state governments has been documented in federal reports. For example, the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 2010, undertook a review of the refugee admissions program taking particular note of the costs associated with education and healthcare for refugees that were being passed onto state and local governments.

The Superintendent for Fort Wayne (Indiana) Community Schools confirmed that the cost of educating refugee students “regularly diverted [funds] from other programs.” The Fort Wayne-Allen County Commissioner of Health also testified to the fact that “[i]ncreasingly the costs of [HIV/AIDS] tests are being dropped on the laps of local and state governments” as well as the expensive life-long treatment for the high incidence of hepatitis B she accidentally discovered among the resettled Burmese. “…another significant cost the local community will be forced to bear.”

The lawsuit seeks to define Tennessee’s rights in light of the forced expenditure of state funds in support of a federal program from which the state has formally withdrawn.

State Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris led the passage of SJR467 and described the suit as seeking declaratory relief in that it, “… offers a unique mechanism by which advocates may seek to remedy ongoing violations of statutory or constitutional law. Sometimes it’s cast in the nature of a friendly lawsuit to bring clarity to an otherwise cloudy situation.”

State Sen. John Stevens and Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver will serve as the named plaintiffs representing the Tennessee General Assembly and the State of Tennessee.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac8f9e434:4d9e97:ebf7d7d1</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — The American Civil Liberties Union staged a nationwide training event Saturday to make sure people are aware of their rights as protesters and urge organized, public resistance by those opposed to policies of President Donald Trump.

Organizers said the event at a sports arena on the University of Miami campus was livestreamed to locations in all 50 states. ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said 200,000 people had signed up to attend one of an estimated 2,000 local events.

The event, staged in town hall style, was aimed at capitalizing on numerous demonstrations since Trump’s election in November and to make sure people know their rights to protest, Romero said. He said priority issues are immigration, the First Amendment free speech and religious freedom rights, civil and reproductive rights and rights of gay, lesbian and transgender people.

“We will bring all the lawsuits necessary to defend these rights,” Romero said. “We’ll do the work in the courts. You do the work in the streets. People are motivated. They want to be engaged.”

The ACLU also launched a new grassroots online organizing platform called PeoplePower.org. It’s billed as a way for people considering a local protest or rally to connect and coordinate with others around the country with similar intentions, and to provide details of ACLU initiatives.

Another plan is creation of “freedom cities” around the country that would encourage local officials to pass laws resisting Trump policies such as stepped-up deportations of people living in the country illegally, said Faiz Shakir, ACLU national political director.

Other parts of Saturday’s event detailed the rules for demonstrations on streets, sidewalks and in public parks, and the rights people have when arrested such as the right to remain silent. ACLU attorney Lee Rowland said large demonstrations generally require a local permit, but government can’t typically shut down protesters in public places without good reason.

“The government can’t censor you just because it disagrees with your opinion,” Rowland said.

Also speaking at the event was Padma Lakshmi, an Indian-born cookbook author, actress, model and television host. She said she emigrated to the U.S. at age four and said the nation appears to be retreating from its welcoming ways.

“Lately I’ve started to feel like an outsider,” she said. “What makes America great is our culture of inclusion. We must not tolerate the intolerance.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac88bb1f0:33b4a4:e843be78</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

My Dear Fellow Americans,

The other day, while checking various websites and news outlets for what’s brewing in the political world, I came upon an article in the Los Angeles Times about conservatives in Hollywood.

Needless to say, I had my own atypical response to this article, for a variety of reasons…

The first reaction I had was one of passionate disappointment. You see, every few years an article like this is written, and it doesn’t change the prevailing narrative; namely, that conservatives in Hollywood are fearful of being blacklisted and unable to find work due to their political beliefs.

But something more important is revealed this time, and that is this: Conservatives in Hollywood simply lack balls.

I want to say I have deep respect and affection for all, but conservatives must no longer walk around like the character Ted Levine played in Silence of the Lambs, with his manhood hidden between his legs (of course, I am not referring to female conservatives, so no sexism here).

Political differences have always occurred amongst the Hollywood set. Back in the 30s, 40s and 50s, Communist socialists were prevalent in Hollywood, and many had to hold their love of Joseph Stalin and his philosophy in the dark for fear of being blacklisted. The difference is , that was an imported Socialistic Marxist ideology that was anathema to America and her principles. The studio heads at that time were a different breed; they had came to America with a love for its opportunity, and under the motto “America First.” Those who were open to this Marxist Communist ideology had to meet in secret, and their numbers grew; they were the True Believers, revolutionaries, many of the elite in Hollywood.

They met in the shadows… and when the light shone upon them, some were punished, and some had careers ruined. But instead of being snuffed out, they went underground, morphed, and were able to continue to affect media, culture, religion, politics and education.

Needless to say, because of this development, Hollywood and the rest of the nation have become indoctrinated to such a degree that we are now a nation entirely at odds with each other. This still goes on today, with major filmmakers using their talents to pick projects that forward their worldview as citizens of the world.

Look, I feel a connectedness to all nationalities and cultures. We are all interconnected. But I maintain a strong American identity. The LA Times article linked to above relates that in the 1990s, there was not as much divisiveness in Hollywood. Well, think about it. We had eight years of Reagan in the 80s, and then four years of Bush I. That’s 12 years of Conservatives in power. Then we had eight years of Clinton, who was something of a moderate, who passed NAFTA. Of course, there seemed to be more unity at the time. But underneath it all, work was being done to change the thinking of the voting populace in America.

Then, after eight years of Bush II and eight years of Obama, Progressive Socialists had finally deconstructed “E pluribus Unum” into special interest groups and wove a new flag, one which did not represent “One Nation Under God ” but which appears to represent “No Nation, No Borders, Burn The Flag.”

My dear friends: satirical, biting political humor has long been a fixture of Hollywood. But I do not ever remember this degree of fear and hatred. The LA Times article, while bemoaning the fate of certain conservatives in the entertainment industry, is also a hit piece on President Trump. The headline alone suggests it, and those great souls in the article who make it known they are reluctant or not Trump supporters provide the tell.

The left in Hollywood are quick to flaunt their political allegiances; this provides them the ability to both grow in number and maintain their level of influence. Meanwhile, the right in Hollywood, for the most part, hide in the shadows and cower. When they do make their views known, conservatives are minimized and their careers are attacked as irrelevant, or as “not A-list enough.” I have been subject to these lines of attack and others, most recently by Billy Maher and some left-wing websites that deliberately misconstrued my statements and attempted to poke fun at me. I get it, fair game!

But, my dear friends, this does not make me cower or hide in the closet. On the contrary, like the great character Cyrano De Bergerac, I find it stimulating. You see, sunlight is needed for life.

I understand the current blacklist; I’ve had my fair share of the insidious tactic. But unless Conservatives can voice their political opinions without fear of personal or professional reprisal, there will never be an equalizing, or even a discussion, with those who disagree.

Look at the courage it took for those brave souls in the LGBT community to come out for their beliefs. If they had remained silent, no change would have occurred. Hollywood conservatives do a disservice to their ideology and the country by not respectfully letting their views be known. This lets the left piss all over you.

If Conservatives came out in force, with ideas and respect and instead of looking at the left as an enemy to hide from… How about convening a conference of Left and Right. Not a “Politicon,” but a meeting for those on the left and we on the right to come together as AMERICANS, and not as each other’s enemy.

I ask a couple of Hollywood’s Elder Statesmen, Norman Lear and Jeffrey Katzenberg, to meet with me to put this idea in motion, and at the same time, on the Conservative side, for Jerry Bruckheimer and Clint Eastwood, to meet with me and discuss how we can find a way forward.

When I was a boy, while watching the funeral procession of the Great Martin Luther King Jr. on NBC, I observed a rickety wooden cart being pulled by two mules and behind the cart, a sea of people. In the cart lay the body of MLK; at that moment, he represented the totality of the human struggle. I remember feeling then, while watching the procession on TV, that we, as a country, were either going to pull together or else come apart.

The country is as divided as it has ever been, and it not because of President Donald Trump. To blame him is a lie and a commonly-used excuse. We in Hollywood can help pull this country together instead of breaking it apart any further. We owe that responsibility to our youth.

Hollywood helps frame a cultural message, and we must step up at this time. The Democrats’ battle cry should not be “RESIST.” This is a danger to the fabric of our society. The blacklist was broken in the 50s; it is time for those in the liberal bastion of power to break it today, and to not punish conservatives for their difference in beliefs. Is this not the American Way?

My dear fellow Hollywood conservatives: do we not as a minority deserve a place at the table? And my dear liberal progressive Hollywood elites: are we not all Americans?

Unemployed, but with big balls,

God bless,

Robert Davi</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac88bb1f0:33b4a3:e843be78</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger told supporters on Sunday via social media that he “won’t be back,” quelling rumors about a possible U.S. Senate run in 2018.

While the 69-year-old actor-turned-politician made it clear he’s not running for Senate, he’s not done with politics. According to Fox News, the two-term former California governor—who has been publicly sparring with President Donald Trump of late, more so since he quit as host of Celebrity Apprentice earlier this month—is setting his sights on reforming the political process.

“I’m deeply flattered by all of the people who have approached me about running for Senate, but my mission right now is to bring sanity to Washington through redistricting reform,” Schwarzenegger wrote on Facebook on Sunday.

In his Facebook post, Schwarzenegger appealed to his social media followers to continue the fight: “Gerrymandering has completely broken our political system and I believe my best platform to help repair it is from the outside, by campaigning for independent redistricting commissions. Thank you for your kind messages and all of the support and I hope you’ll join me in my battle against gerrymandering with the same enthusiasm.”

Schwarzenegger’s post was in response to a Politico report that the former “Governator” and movie star was mulling a bid for the Senate seat currently held by Democrat Diane Feinstein, who is rumored to be retiring in 2018. Given the fallout over his affair with a housekeeper that broke up his marriage — and the intense unpopularity of the Republican brand in California — the rumor was that Schwarzenegger would run as an independent.

The fact that there will not, in fact, be a political comeback for the man whose trademark line is “I’ll be back” is a throwback to the famous promise General Douglas MacArthur made at Corregidor to return to the embattled Philippine Islands: “I Shall Return.”

But in the era of Trump, where everything is simply a negotiation, this likely isn’t the last we’ve heard of the “Terminator.”

In parts one and two of our guided tour of the Deep State, we looked at two anchors of the Federal Triangle in downtown DC, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency. And while Virgil looks forward to continuing his tour of the Triangle and other nodes of the Deep State, sometimes breaking news breaks in, and so we should pause to consider the latest.

On March 10, from his podium at the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, President Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, was asked about the Deep State. The question:

Does the White House believe in a “Deep State” that is actively working to undermine the president?

And here’s Spicer’s answer:

I think that there’s no question when you have eight years of one party in office, there are people who stay in government—and continue to espouse the agenda of the previous administration. So I don’t think it should come as any surprise there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration and may have believed in that agenda and want to continue to seek it. I don’t think that should come as a surprise.

In other words, Spicer’s answer to the answer to the question was “Yes.” So now there can be no doubt that the concept of the Deep State will be discussed for a long time to come. And yet if Virgil might be permitted to quibble with Spicer, he would say that the Deep State is a lot deeper than just the past eight years—we’ll come back to that point.

But first, let’s hear from other voices on the issue of whether or not there’s a Deep State. As we can see, it’s gaining a critical mass of recognition, at least on the right. And that’s good, because, as they say, forewarned is forearmed.

On March 5, former House speaker Newt Gingrich made himself clear—as he always does:

There is an active Deep State opposition to a populist disruptive reformer. Many [in the government] believe it is their duty to break the law and lie. For Trump to succeed, there will have to be profound overhaul of the bureaucracy.

A few days later, Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) didn’t use the actual words “Deep State,” but his point was the same when he described the situation in Powertown: “The same people were there, and they don’t think the new owners or the new managers should be running the ship.” And then Kelly added this point about former president Barack Obama:

He’s only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is totally going to upset the new agenda.

So is the 44th president setting up a permanent campaign against the 45th president? Obama denies any such intention; he says that he and his family are remaining in Washington so that his youngest daughter, Sasha, can finish high school. Of course, that explanation doesn’t quite tell us why former White House consigliere Valerie Jarrett has moved into the Obamas’ 8200-square-foot home in the swanky Kalorama neighborhood, just a couple miles north of the White House.

In fact, the real goal of the relocation, according to The Daily Mail, is to “oust Trump from the presidency either by forcing his resignation or through his impeachment.”

Meanwhile, others in Congress, too, are eyeing closely the shadowy armada arrayed against the new administration. In the words of Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), “I think it’s really the Deep State vs. the president, the duly elected president.”

And on March 9, Fox News’ Sean Hannity, was even more direct:

Deep State Obama holdovers embedded like barnacles in the federal bureaucracy are hell-bent on destroying President Trump. It’s time for the Trump administration to purge these saboteurs.

Interestingly, by coincidence, or perhaps not, the very next day President Trump’s Justice Department ordered the firing of 46 US Attorneys, all Obama holdovers.

Still, some in the Main Stream Media, even now, choose to deny that there is any such thing as a Deep State. One such is David Ignatius, veteran columnist for The Washington Post, who wrote on March 7 that what we’re seeing is simply the collision of President Trump and the properly established legal system:

Some [Trump] supporters claim he’s facing a secret coup from an intelligence and foreign policy establishment that constitutes a despotic “deep state.” But really, Trump is confronting the orderly process we call the “rule of law.”

Virgil thinks that it’s rich, indeed, for Ignatius to insist that there’s nothing going on except the proper rule of law. Why? Because it was Ignatius’ own reporting, back on January 12, that demonstrated the extra-legal power of the Deep State. That was the report that revealed that on December 29, Michael Flynn, named as Trump’s national security adviser in the new administration, had been intercepted talking on the phone to the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. And from that first report, events tumbled, and as we all know, Flynn resigned from his White House post on February 13.

And yet a few days after that Ignatius story ran on January 12, Virgil wondered aloud how he got the information about a private phone call: “Now how did Ignatius know that?” That is, how did Ignatius learn about the Flynn-Kislyak conversation? Continuing, Virgil wrote back then, “The Postman won’t say, other than that he got his information from a ‘senior US government official.’” Virgil then pointed out that even if was legal to record the call—yes, it’s smart to surveil Russians—it’s not legal to leak such information to the media, especially if it involves an American citizen. “Such disclosures aren’t legal,” Virgil added with a sigh, “but once again, nobody in Washington, DC, seems to care.”

So we can see: In the Flynn case, the power of the Deep State wasn’t at all about the “rule of law.” It was about just the opposite.

Others, too, take the Ignatius line—even if their denials are weirdly weak and self-contradicting. Here, for example is a March 9 headline in Politico, the bible of the Beltway: “The Deep State Is a Figment of Steve Bannon’s Imagination.” The author, Loren DeJonge Schulman, starts out by firing both barrels at Bannon and anyone else who might have suspicions about the Deep State:

Here’s a handy rule for assessing the credibility of what you’re reading about national security in the Trump era: If somebody uses the term “Deep State,” you can be pretty sure they have no idea what they’re talking about.

Got that? Nothing to see here: So if you hear Spicer, Gingrich, Kelly, Massie, Hannity—or, of course, ol’ Virgil—nattering on about the Deep State, well, have a dunce cap handy.

So who’s the author of this don’t-worry-about-a-thing piece? We can see from her bio that Loren DeJonge Schulman, who now works at a Democratic-aligned think-tank in DC, has an extensive background in the politics of the Democratic Party and the Deep State, both.

So maybe it’s not so surprising that Schulman wouldn’t want anyone nosing around too much in Deep State matters. After all, nobody likes being snooped on, right? In fact, Virgil is reminded of the 1999 Brad Pitt movie, Fight Club, featuring these oft-repeated lines:

Welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club!

That was Hollywood’s way of expressing the most basic wisdom of any secret enterprise: Keep it secret!

So Virgil was surprised to see how Schulman chose to end her denial piece. After nearly 2000 words of mercilessly mocking the idea that there was any such thing as a Deep State, Schulman closed by . . . outing herself as a Deep Stater:

So the next time you hear someone using the term Deep State, send them a copy of this article. Ask them to stop using it. Tell them the term betrays their ignorance, and obscures and misleads far more than it illuminates. And if that doesn’t work, well, we Deep Staters will take matters into our own hands.

One supposes that Schulman would say that her final words were just her way of being funny: What an arch sense of humor she has! And no doubt she got some yuks from her pals in Cleveland Park, Crystal City, and Chevy Chase. Meanwhile, other Americans, curious about how they are being governed, might wonder what’s so funny about being threatened by a well-connected Beltway apparatchik.

Yes, an attempt at humor, however ominous, is one possible explanation for Schulman’s close. Another possibility is that she is, in fact, proud to be a Deep Stater, and that her pride shines right through her feigned irony. That is, she is eager to signal to her friends and colleagues in the Deep State that she is truly one of them, even as she laughs it off.

Was her Politico piece a successful stratagem? Did Schulman succeed in playing her double game? That is, proving that she is one of the cool kids, even as she convinced readers that only dopes and paranoids worry about the Deep State? Virgil reports, you decide.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac88bb1f0:33b4a1:e843be78</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Snoop Dogg stars in a new politically-charged music video that sees the rapper pull a gun on and “shoot” a parody clown version of President Donald Trump.

Visuals for “Lavender,” a song that first appeared on BADBADNOTGOOD and Kaytranada’s IV, show a clown-faced President “Ronald Klump” holding a press conference where he announces a plan to “deport all dogs.”

“The ban that this motherf*cker tried to put up; him winning the presidency,” Snoop says is what inspired the concept of that part of the video, Billboard reports.

The dog deportation plan spurs Snoop Dogg and a gang of armed men to ambush the parody President Trump. Snoop points a gun at Trump’s head and pulls the trigger. A giant “BANG” flag pops out.

Snoop says he’s not worried about what his critics might say of the controversial scene.

“When I be putting sh*t out, I don’t ever expect or look for a reaction. I just put it out because I feel like it’s something that’s missing. Any time I drop something, I’m trying to fill in a void,” Snoop says. “I feel like it’s a lot of people making cool records, having fun, partying, but nobody’s dealing with the real issue with this f*cking clown as president, and the sh*t that we dealing with out here, so I wanted to take time out to push pause on a party record and make one of these records for the time being.”

The next scenes show the clown-face Trump tied up in chains begging for a chance to smoke a joint that’s being passed back and forth.

The four-minute music video, directed by Jesse Wellens and James DeFina, also features actor Michael Rapaport dressed as a clown, who is pulled over and shot by a clown-faced police officer.

The scene was apparently inspired by the fatal police-involved shooting of Philando Castile by a Minnesota police officer last summer, in an incident that was live-streamed in a widely shared Facebook video.

“It’s a lot of clown sh-t going on that we could just sit and talk on the phone all day about, but it’s a few issues that we really wanted to lock into [for the video] like police, the president and just life in general,” Snoop said.

He added: “Police being able to kill motherf*ckers and get away with it; people being in jail for weed for 20, 30 years and motherf*ckers that’s not black on the streets making money off of it. but if you got color or ethnicity connected to your name, you’ve been wrongfully accused or locked up for it, and then you watching people not of color position themselves to get millions and billions off of it.”

Sunday, on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,” talk show host Jerry Springer suggested that White House Chief Strategist and former Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon “has a philosophical goal” to “do away with a multicultural America,” which is why he and President Donald Trump go after the courts and the media.

“Bannon has a philosophical goal, and that is, as I said before, to do away with a multicultural America. He wants America to be basically Christian and white. So keep out the Mexicans, keep out the Muslims, etc.,” Springer explained.

The “Jerry Springer Show” host also said Twitter is like a “drug” for the president.

“[Trump] can’t get the mainstream media, because obviously, they won’t respect him,” Springer added. “So, therefore, he goes to the things he can control. That’s the tabloid journalism or the Twitter account. So, Trump gets his drug, and Bannon gets the goal of doing away with mainstream media.”

We have no intention to allow the extra-legal activities of former President Obama’s administration to fade into the sunset now that he is out of office. Particularly egregious was his use of the might of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to target groups that disagreed with his political views.

And heel-dragging at the IRS continues.

Last week, Judicial Watch reported that the agency informed the U.S. District Court that it located “an additional 6,924 documents of potentially responsive records” relating to our 2015 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit regarding the Obama IRS targeting scandal.

The lawsuit at issue sought records about the IRS selection of individuals and organizations for audits based upon applications requesting non-profit tax status filed by Tea Party and other 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organizations (Judicial Watch v. Internal Revenue Service (No. 1:15-cv-00220)).

These newly identified records are presumably not the records contained in the so-called “Congressional Database,” which the IRS created in 2013 to house records responsive to congressional inquiries into the IRS scandal.

The IRS informed JW Monday that it is producing an additional 694 pages of documents and expects to produce an additional batch by March 24, 2017. However, at this time, the IRS still has not provided an estimate regarding when it will complete its review of the potentially responsive documents.

The corruption at the IRS is astounding. Our attorneys knew that there were more records to be searched, but the Obama IRS ignored this issue for years.

Remember that in July 2015, we released Obama IRS documents confirming that the agency used donor lists of tax-exempt organizations to target those donors for audits. The documents also show that IRS officials specifically highlighted how the U.S. Chamber of Commerce may come under “high scrutiny” from the IRS.

In September 2014, another JW FOIA lawsuit forced the release of documents detailing that the IRS sought, obtained, and maintained the names of donors to tea party and other conservative groups. IRS officials acknowledged in these documents that “such information was not needed.” The documents also show that the donor names were being used for a “secret research project.”

The Obama IRS scandal continues, and President Trump needs to clean house at the IRS as quickly as possible.

A new wave of anti-Semitic bomb threats targeted at least six Jewish community centers nationwide Sunday, forcing evacuations of many of these venues, including one in Houston.

The threats came on the Jewish holiday of Purim, which tells the story of the Jewish people triumphing over an evil man who sought their annihilation in ancient Persia.

Staff at the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center (JCC) in southwest Houston called police after receiving the threat by email. They evacuated staff, students and members. Officers said the threat claimed a device would explode on the premises at 2:30 p.m., KHOU reported. Bomb sniffing dogs and law enforcement swept the building but nothing suspicious was found.

In response to Sunday’s anti-Semitic incident, Joel Dinkin, executive vice president of the Evelyn Rubenstein JCC, said community members and staff were “disturbed” by the threat. “You can’t prepare for it,” he told the Houston Chronicle. “You can only continue to review your protocols and respond accordingly.”

Other bomb threats occurred on Sunday at Jewish community centers in New York, Rochester, Indianapolis, and one outside of Milwaukee. No suspicious materials were found in any of these facilities either. An affiliated Canadian JCC in Vancouver, British Columbia, also received a threat later deemed “non-credible,” according to the Jewish Press. Reportedly, more than 150 bomb threats have targeted Jewish venues since the beginning of the year.

This was also the second bomb threat the Evelyn Rubenstein JCC received in 2017. On February 20, this facility was among at least 10 other Jewish community centers across the country to get a bomb threat by phone, according to the JCC Association of North America. At the time, parents were alerted and the staff and students inside were evacuated to a separate building while Houston police and bomb sniffing dogs combed the facility, KPRC reported. They found nothing suspicious in this incident either.

In a March 8 letter, more than 140 leaders affiliated with the JCC Association of North America, including Dinkin, asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to beef up federal resources to find and bring to justice the perpetrator(s) “who are trying to instill anxiety and fear in communities across the country.”

JCC leadership pointed out these centers serve millions of Americans, Jewish and non-Jewish, who rely on them for early child education, senior programs, recreational, fitness, cultural, and other learning social opportunities.

“While we are relieved that no one has been hurt, and all calls have been hoaxes, anti-Semitism of this nature should not, and must not, be allowed to endure in our communities or to metastasize into something worse,” the letter stated.

Earlier in March, U.S. Jewish groups hailed President Donald Trump’s condemnation of anti-Semitism in opening remarks to his first address to Congress, Breitbart Jerusalem reported.

On Friday, vandals defaced Seattle synagogue Temple De Hirsch Sinai by spray painting Holocaust-denying graffiti onto an exterior wall. It read: “The Holocaust is fake news.” An off-duty police officer discovered it on the façade of the old sanctuary. KING reported the temple decided to keep the graffiti uncovered so people could see what happened. The Seattle Police Bias Crimes unit continues to investigate the anti-Semitic rhetoric on the synagogue and add patrol units in the area. Founded in 1899, the temple has the largest Reform congregation in the Pacific Northwest.

President Donald Trump will host the Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago estate, according to Mike Allen of Axios.

The president will host Xi in April for a political working session at Trump’s “Winter White House,” where he goes to make some of his biggest deals.

Trump extended the Mar-a-Lago invitation to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife in February, where the two couples dined with New England Patriot’s owner Robert Kraft. Trump also golfed with Abe at his golf course in Palm Beach.

But according to Allen, Trump will not be golfing with the Chinese president. The two leaders will likely discuss a number of sensitive issues, including trade policies, Xi’s military buildup in the South China Sea, and the ongoing disruptions in North Korea.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac7c963ac:2073c2:e843be78</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Andrew Marantz of the New Yorker gives a platform to establishment reporters whinging about how President Donald Trump is changing the White House’s interactions with the press. It’s not about their egos and seating charts, they feel the need to protest — they just “don’t appreciate diversity of journalistic practice.” (???)

From The New Yorker:

Major Garrett, the chief White House correspondent for CBS News, sits in the front row. “Historically, the way the briefing room has been organized is, the closer you are, the farther you’ve come,” Garrett said. “And the person at the podium has tended to recognize that.” More experienced reporters, he said, “ask questions that are sharper, more informed. Not, ‘What’s your message today?’ Not, ‘Here’s a paintbrush—would you paint us a pretty picture?’ ” If established reporters got fewer questions relative to the floaters, I asked, would this be good or bad for democracy? “We’ll see,” Garrett said. “We’re engaged in a grand experiment.”

A TV correspondent told me that calling on front-row reporters first isn’t just about appealing to their egos: “It’s also about maintaining a sense of predictability, a sense that eventually the substantive questions will be answered. Throwing that into chaos—‘Maybe you’ll get a question, if you shout loud enough, who knows?’—makes everyone desperate and competitive and makes us look like a bunch of braying jackals. Which I don’t think is an accident.”

About once a week, the walls behind the lectern are turned inside-out, revealing built-in screens from which reporters around the country can ask questions by video link. This is another Spicer innovation—the “Skype seats.” Recent Skype questions were allotted to a Trump supporter and newspaper owner in Kentucky, who asked about reducing coal-mining regulations, and to a talk-radio host named Lars Larson, who addressed the press secretary, an officer in the Navy Reserve, as “Commander Spicer,” before asking whether the Administration would privatize federally protected parkland. During one of these sessions, Jared Rizzi, a White House correspondent for Sirius XM, tweeted, “Skypeophant (n.) – super-friendly questioner used to burn up briefing time through the magic of early-aughts technology.” “I certainly appreciate the purpose of bringing geographic diversity into the room,” Rizzi told me. “I also appreciate ideological diversity. I don’t appreciate diversity of journalistic practice.”

A longtime Washington reporter from a mainstream network echoed that sentiment. “I don’t mind them bringing in conservative voices that they feel have been underrepresented,” he said. “Personally, I don’t even mind them fucking with the front-row guys, the Jonathan Karls of the world. Those guys are a smug little cartel, and it’s fun to watch them squirm, at least for a little while. But at what point does it start to delegitimize the whole idea of what happens in that room? When does it cross the line into pure trolling?”

The president charges that the Obama administration conducted surveillance on Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. His critics charge him with making baseless accusations.

Bernie Sanders labeled Trump’s claim “delusional,” a Politico article by Bradley Moss calls the notion “preposterous,” and Al Franken dubbed it “ridiculous.” John McCain reentered the fray over the weekend, opining, “The president has one of two choices, either retract, or to provide the information that the American people deserve.”

Put another way, either Barack Obama snooped or he didn’t snoop. President Trump releasing Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court requests may go a long way toward proving or disproving his claim. While forthcoming information may substantiate or invalidate Trump’s specific accusation, the general notion that presidents, particularly Democratic presidents, remain above abusing the security apparatus to violate civil liberties of private citizens ranks as, if not delusional, preposterous, and ridiculous, at least slightly naïve.

If Barack Obama spied on a political enemy under the guise of spying on a foreign enemy, he finds himself in bad company. Contrary to the “shocked, shocked” reactions, presidents other than Richard Nixon abused power to abuse political enemies—and violate the civil liberties of strangers.

President Woodrow Wilson signed the Alien Act, the Sedition Act, Espionage Act, and the Trading with the Enemy Act, which empowered the federal government to send socialist leader Eugene Debs to prison for opposing the draft, to revoke the postal privileges of the American Socialist, the New York Call, and other left-wing publications, and to deport sundry radicals, most notably on the famous “Soviet Ark.” Although the president’s prejudices recently sparked a reorientation of his legacy among race-conscious liberals, his vindictive use of federal power to punish adversaries goes barely mentioned.

President Franklin Roosevelt, over the objections of “Mr. Republican” Robert Taft, instituted an internment and relocation program for those of Japanese, German, and Italian descent in America. The Korematsu decision, in which six justices—five appointed to the court and the sixth appointed as chief justice by the 32nd president—upheld Roosevelt’s 1942 executive order barring Americans of Japanese-Americans, including the Oakland-born Fred Korematsu, from residing on the West Coast. The order and decision regularly receive condemnation from Democrats decades after the fact. In real time, Democrats devised, praised, and upheld the constitutionality of the policy.

President John F. Kennedy’s administration launched a federal invasion of Martin Luther King’s privacy that ended only with the minister’s death. The president’s brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, authorized wiretaps and bugs to glean personal information about King. The president, himself a man of great appetites, shared stories of King’s sexual interests, including allegedly attempting to organize a sex party coinciding with 1963’s March on Washington, with intimates. The prying says more about the Kennedys than King. But historians don’t say much about the role of the eavesdroppers. Taylor Branch, for instance, maintains that J. Edgar Hoover “manipulated” the Brothers Kennedy into hounding the civil-rights leader. This popular narrative imagines that the FBI director ordered around the president and the attorney general rather than the reverse.

So many policies decried as infringements on civil liberties by today’s Democrats came into existence because yesterday’s Democrats regarded them as enlightened. The Palmer Raids and the McCarran Act got their names from a progressive Democrat and a conservative Democrat, respectively. Samuel Dickstein, the congressman whose resolution launched the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUA), actually served as a paid agent of the Soviet Union. Republicans controlled the House, and its controversial committee, in just four of the 36 years of the much-maligned HCUA’s existence.

Democrats jailed Eugene Debs, forcibly relocated Fred Korematsu and barred Joe DiMaggio’s fisherman-father from his profession, and authorized the bugs that mined the most personal details from Martin Luther King’s private life.

But trust them. They don’t do such things any longer.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac7c963ac:2073bf:e843be78</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Take a look at the crime statistics for just one state, Texas. A 2017 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety reveals that over the period from June 1, 2011 to February 28, 2017, the 215,000 criminal aliens who were booked into Texas jails were collectively charged with 566,000 offenses, including 1,167 homicides and 6,098 sexual assaults, with a total of 257,000 convictions.

By the way, Texas has less than half the criminal alien jail and prison population of California, which has over 100,000 criminal aliens occupying facilities supported by California taxpayers. (For 2009 incarceration numbers for each state, see Appendix III of the 2011 GAO report, here.)

It’s no secret that progressive politicians in hundreds of cities and counties are opposing the Trump administration initiatives to end so-called “sanctuary” policies. What those politicians never talk about is the fact that those policies continue to allow tens of thousands of criminal aliens to go free instead of facing deportation proceedings as prescribed by federal law.

According to a summary report on sanctuary policies from Federation for American Immigration Reform and numerous media reports, it’s not just San Francisco, New York and Chicago that are obstructing federal deportation of violent criminals. About 300 local city and county jurisdictions have adopted official policies to refuse cooperation with immigration enforcement in open violation of federal law. And California is not the only place with a statewide sanctuary policy. For a map of principal sanctuary jurisdictions, go here.

You might think that Texas is a state with uniform cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, but you would be wrong. The capital city of Austin recently announced it will defy President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security and the Governor of Texas by continuing its sanctuary policies.

Yes, there’s a new sheriff in town, and citizens will soon have new protections if the new federal policies are followed. President Trump’s January 25 executive order is only the beginning of the fight, and we can expect the ACLU and other open borders advocates will challenge new enforcement policies in federal courts.

Here is the political reality. Sanctuary policies across the country are an important pillar of the “Obama Legacy,” so progressives and the leaders of the Democratic Party are not going to abandon that legacy. This commitment by progressives makes immigration enforcement and the end of local sanctuary policies far more of a political issue than in the past.

Until Obama’s election in 2008, there were only a handful of sanctuary cities across the nation, but the number skyrocketed after 2008 and now numbers over 300 according to a recent report from the Center for Immigration Studies. A 2016 report by the Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Justice found 155 jurisdictions that limit or restrict cooperation with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

But as we said, there is a new sheriff in town — and his deputies have been busy.

Trump’s January 25 Executive Order was followed on February 20 by a Department of Homeland Security Memorandum titled, “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest.” It is well worth reading in full.

This directive has many features that have already been welcomed as a breath of fresh air in the ranks of the officers of the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One section of the DHS Memorandum that has been largely overlooked by the media could well serve as a giant spotlight on the devastation in local communities caused by sanctuary policies.

Section “H” of the February 20 DHS Enforcement Memorandum, “Collecting and Reporting Data on Alien Apprehension and Release,” directs the agency to collect and publish on a weekly basis data from “all state and local jurisdictions” on criminal alien arrests, convictions, releases, as well as rejections of ICE detainer requests by local authorities.

data from “all state and local jurisdictions” on criminal alien arrests, convictions, releases, as well as rejections of ICE detainer requests by local authorities. Once public, this data will alert citizens in every city and county in America as to exactly how many criminal aliens are being released back into the community instead of being deported or taken into federal custody.

The taxpayer cost alone of incarceration of criminal aliens in state and local jails is $7 BILLION annually, as explained in one of my earlier Breitbart News columns.

A 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report revealed that the typical criminal alien inmate in federal prisons had been arrested 12 times for various offenses. On page 17 that GAO report is a summary of the arrest data for the criminal aliens in state and federal jails:

They were arrested for a total of about 2.9 million offenses, averaging about 12[each]… slightly lower than the 13 offenses per criminal alien we reported in 2005.

The Texas DPS report cited above said criminal aliens arrested over that five-year period had been arrested for an average of 2.5 crimes. Taking the average number of crimes committed by ARRESTED criminal aliens as five, and extrapolating from the data on the total number of criminal alien inmates in state and local jails in 2016, the approximately 300,000 criminal aliens in state and local jails are responsible for over 1,500,00 crimes.

In Colorado, the 2,039 criminal aliens in the state prison system in 2016 were 14.7 percent of a prison population of 13,873. The 2016 annual report on the criminal aliens in the Colorado state prison system is here. The 14.7 percent can be easily calculated from the 2,039 inmates in a total prison population of 13,873 found in this document.

This 14.7 percent is over four times the illegal alien population share of total state population, estimated at 200,000 in 2013 by the Pew Hispanic Center.

It is true that even under Obama’s lax policies on enforcement and deportations, local ICE offices routinely intercepted criminal alien felons being released from state prisons and deported the most violent among them. But it was a far different story for the thousands of criminals released from LOCAL jails in dozens of sanctuary jurisdictions, where federal ICE detainers were not being honored and violent criminals were routinely released to commit other crimes.

Even the pro-sanctuary Denver Post could not ignore two recent cases where an ICE detainer request was ignored and illegal aliens were released by the Denver jail and then arrested for homicide only weeks later. One case was a hit-and-run accident that left a young woman dead, and the second was a brutal murder at a light rail stop.

Unfortunately, our nation’s intrepid journalists are not routinely reporting on the thousands of crimes committed by criminal aliens who have been in police custody but then released because of sanctuary policies. It is conceivable that at least a half million serious crimes annually could be prevented if all illegal aliens convicted of felonies were deported — and then prevented from returning by effective border controls.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac6060702:1196e71:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The head of the group attempting to bring the 2024 Olympics to Los Angeles says he has a much better supporter in Donald Trump than he had in Barack Obama.

Gene Sykes, head of LA2024, spoke on Thursday at the Montgomery Conference in Santa Monica, during which he painted a picture of President Trump’s involvement in the Olympic bidding process that greatly contrasts with the picture presented by the media and other sports elites.

“The Donald Trump effect, for us, is a double-edged sword,” Sykes said, according to KPCC. Sykes then went on to explain how, despite President Trump’s strong stances on immigration and other issues which have bothered some international Olympic officials, Donald Trump has been most valuable in gaining support for the Los Angeles bid.

Sykes then pointed out how Trump’s efforts differ from those of his predecessor. After remarking about how Obama’s interest in the Olympics waned after an attempt to win the games for Chicago in 2016 failed, Sykes said of Obama, “He never went to an Olympic games, never met with the IOC [International Olympic Committee] leadership, never talked to them by phone, and showed sort of a disregard and that was deeply frustrating to the leaders of the IOC.”

Sykes then spoke about a situation that involved some Iranian archers who found themselves turned back at the airport in Las Vegas during President Trump’s first immigration ban. Specifically, Sykes mentioned how the President Trump intervened, “As soon as they learned they had created a problem for us they said ‘We’ll help you. We’ll solve the problem.’ ” They’ve set up a team in the White House to help us.”

Though Sykes made no mistake about the obstacles ahead with some Olympic Committee members who have serious issues with Trump, Sykes said, “The President presents an image which is a challenging image for some of these voters. They don’t like the anti-immigrant stance. They don’t like the presumed anti-Muslim rhetoric. All that is alarming to them. We’ve heard it. We continue to hear it. It’s an issue.”

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said President Donald Trump was creating a “toxic environment” of “increased fear in our country.”

Booker said, “This is the problem, I don’t care what party you are in right now, recognize this, we are at a time of increased fear in our country.”

He added, “There is something seriously wrong when mendacity has become the norm. There is something seriously wrong when law-abiding citizens are afraid to leave their homes. There is something seriously wrong when hate crimes are surging. There is something seriously wrong when this is a toxic environment being created right now. And I don’t care who you are, if you consider yourself a leader, you have an obligation to stand up and do something about it and lead with love and not appealing to people’s darker angels or exploiting that fear.”

A second federal judge—this one in Wisconsin—on Friday blocked President Donald Trump’s new executive order (EO) on immigration travel, while the federal judge who blocked the first EO is reserving judgment on the revised EO.

Trump signed EO 13780 on Mar. 6, replacing his original order (EO 13769), temporarily restricting immigration from several terror-prone nations. Judge James Robart of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the first EO. The San Francisco-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit kept the TRO in place.

Lawsuits have also been filed against the new EO 13780. The plaintiff states in the original TRO lawsuit—a growing list that currently includes Washington, Minnesota, and Oregon—asked Robart to rule that the TRO blocking EO 13769 likewise applies to the new EO. Robart released an order Friday stating that none of the parties have properly filed new motions in that litigation — and that he will reserve judgment until there is a relevant motion and the legal issues have been fully briefed before his court.

However, on that same day, Judge William Conley of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin did issue a new TRO against the new EO, holding that the plaintiff in that new lawsuit had a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and would suffer irreparable harm unless the court provided immediate relief. This new lawsuit in Wisconsin concerns a man with a family member in Syria who has applied for asylum and claims that EO 13780 is thwarting that asylum request.

A TRO is a temporary emergency measure that typically lasts less than two weeks, only long enough to give a district court judge enough time to fully consider an urgent matter in a lawsuit. A TRO is only issued in extraordinary situations.

Conley has ordered legal briefs filed on an expedited basis for the next stage of litigation and will hold a court hearing on Mar. 21 on whether to convert the TRO into a preliminary injunction, a longer-term remedy that could stay in place for however long it takes to reach a final decision on the legality of EO 13780.

Although a TRO cannot be appealed, a preliminary injunction can, which could take either case quickly to the next level of the federal judiciary. The Washington case would go back to the Ninth Circuit, while the Wisconsin case would go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago.

The first case is Washington v. Trump, No. 2:17-cv-141 in the Western District of Washington.

The second case is Doe v. Trump, No. 3:17-cv-112 in the Western District of Wisconsin.

New York Times columnist Max Fisher, in a piece titled “What Happens When You Fight a ‘Deep State’ That Doesn’t Exist,” whines that President Donald Trump and populist conservatives have appropriated the term “Deep State” — just like the briefly trendy buzzword of “fake news.”

From the New York Times:

Though Mr. Trump has not publicly used the phrase, allies and sympathetic news media outlets have repurposed “deep state” from its formal meaning — a network of civilian and military officials who control or undermine democratically elected governments — to a pejorative meant to accuse civil servants of illegitimacy and political animus.

It is akin to Mr. Trump’s appropriation of “fake news,” a term that originally described rumor mills but one that he has used against any outlet that reports real news unfavorable to his administration.

Much as his use of “fake news” miscasts reporting as lying, “deep state” presents apolitical civil servants as partisan agents. And it mischaracterizes those officials, who seek to defend their place within the system, by presenting them as acting against that system.

A Kremlin spokesman claimed to Fareed Zakaria that the Russian ambassador who met President Trump’s officials during last year’s campaign conducted similar meetings with Hillary Clinton’s advisers as well.

Speaking Sunday on Zakaria’s “GPS” show on CNN, Dmitry Peskov said ambassador Sergey Kislyak met with “people working in think tanks advising Hillary or advising people working for Hillary.”

Some of Peskov’s comments on the show, as reported by The Hill:

“Well, if you look at some people connected with Hillary Clinton during her campaign, you would probably see that he had lots of meetings of that kind,” Peskov told Zakaria, before adding that it is the job of Kislyak to meet with officials on both sides to talk about “bilateral relations.”

Peskov also defended those meetings, saying they were not an attempt to interfere in the 2016 election.

“But there were no meetings about elections — electoral process … So if you look at it with intention to demonize Russia, you would probably say that, yes, he was trying to interfere in Hillary’s activities. But it would be nonsense, because this is not true,” Peskov said.

Sunday on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” while discussing the Republicans the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said there is a “separation between” Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) and President Donald Trump.

Paul said, “I think there is a separation between the two. I have talked to the president, I think three times on Obamacare and I hear from him he is willing to negotiate. You know what I hear from Paul Ryan ‘it is a binary choice, young man.’ But what is a binary choice, his way or the highway?”

Saturday Night Live took aim at Ivanka Trump during its March 11 episode, with actress Scarlett Johansson playing a parody version of the First Daughter in a mock commercial for a perfume called “Complicit.”

Johansson, who hosted the NBC comedy show for the fifth time Saturday night, is pictured in the sketch walking into a room filled with gold fixtures and where champagne is being served to party guests.

“Every man knows her name. Every woman knows her face,” a commercial voice-over plays over the ad. “When she walks into a room, all eyes are on her. She’s Ivanka. And a woman like her deserves a fragrance all her own.”

“A scent made just for her. Because she’s beautiful. She’s powerful. She’s… Complicit,” the ad continues.

The ad describes President Trump’s eldest daughter as a woman “who knows what she wants, and knows what she’s doing.”

Johansson as Trump then steps in front of a full-length mirror to apply lipstick and is faced with a reflection of her father, played on the show by Alec Baldwin.

“A feminist. An advocate. A champion for women. Like, how?” the voice-over continues. “She’s loyal. Devoted. But probably should have bounced after that whole Access Hollywood bus thing. Oh, well.”

“Complicit. The fragrance for the woman could stop all this, but won’t,” the ad concludes.

Johansson has been a vocal critic of the new president; in January, the 32-year-old actress and Planned Parenthood supporter marched in the anti-Trump Women’s March on Washington, explaining that she did so to “let our next president know that we, men and women alike, will not stand down or be silenced and will fight to protect our bodies and our choices.”

Johansson herself has also been mocked and targeted for her political views. In 2014, the actress earned the scorn of Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) activists for appearing in an advertising campaign for the Israeli soda-maker company SodaStream.

NBC News Justice Correspondent Pete Williams weighed in on President Donald Trump asking 46 United States Attorneys appointed by the previous administration to resign, saying the move isn’t common, but also not without precedent, noting that former President Bill Clinton did the same thing in 1993 when he took office.

“These firings come the day after a commentary from Sean Hannity of Fox News, who urged the president to get rid of all the holdover political appointees, and some Justice Department officials say they think the firings were, in part, a response to that. … The Obama and George W. Bush administrations did replace U.S. Attorneys, but did so gradually. But in 1993, the Justice Department demanded the resignations of all of them shortly after Bill Clinton took office,” Williams said.

CNN anchor Jake Tapper says his 7-year-old son has started using President Trump’s term “fake news.”

“[He] now does an impression where whenever I’m bothering him he says, ‘fake news,’ ” Tapper said with a laugh during a talk at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Festival in Austin, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

“I’ve got two kids,” Tapper said. “They’re going to someday read back about this period in our history and I want them to be proud of me.”

Tapper, the host of CNN’s “The Lead” and “State of the Union,” dismissed criticism that he was too tough on the Trump administration, responding that he treated the Obama administration the same way.

“To be completely candid, I did fact checks about [former President] Barack Obama, too,” he said. “Not at the same rate, nor was there a need for them at the same rate.

“I know people that hated me then back then but now like the fact checks I’m doing about Donald Trump. I feel like I’m being consistent.”

Tapper even named three instances of what he thought was “fake news” in the Trump administration.

“I call ‘fake news’ three recent things: When Trump said nobody in his campaign spoke to Russia, and they did; when Michael Flynn said he didn’t have contact with the Russians, and he did; and now our Attorney General said he didn’t speak to the Russians. … The White House wants to delegitimize any checks and balances,” Tapper said, according to Deadline.

Trump and other figures in his administration have called CNN, the New York Times, and any news report that they consider biased “fake news.”

Don&apos;t let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infighting in the Trump Admin. We are getting along great, and getting major things done! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017

Recently, Trump railed against “fake news” reports about infighting in the Trump administration.

“Don’t let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infighting in the Trump Admin. We are getting along great, and getting major things done!” Trump wrote on Twitter.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac3e2c5b7:effa26:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The cold open of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” this week was a skit with Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump dealing with an alien invasion in America.

In the skit, Baldwin’s Trump addressed a group of military members, calling two black female soldiers aliens based on reporting from Infowars. He also altered the words to the Pledge of Allegiance.

At the end, the aliens made it in the military base and asked to speak to the leader.

“Trump” then told the aliens that someone else was the leader.

After finding out Trump was actually the president, one of the aliens exclaimed, “Really? This is going to be so easy!”

Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” President Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said that “nobody will be worse off financially” if Republicans in Congress repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act dubbed Obamacare.

Price said, “I firmly believe that nobody will be worse off financially in the process that we’re going through, understanding that they’ll have choices that they can select the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their family, not that the government forces them to buy. So there’s cost that needs to come down, and we believe we’re going to be able to do that through this system. There’s coverage that’s going to go up.”

Price added, “I believe, and the president believes firmly, that if you create a system that’s accessible for everybody and you provide the financial feasibility for everybody to get coverage, that we have a great opportunity to increase coverage over where we are right now, as opposed to where the line is going right now where people are losing coverage and we’re going to have fewer individuals covered than we do currently.”

LA2024 Chief Executive Officer Gene Sykes told Southern California Public Radio’s 89.3 KPCC last Thursday that President Donald Trump had been more helpful than President Barack Obama in helping to secure the 2024 Olympics for Los Angeles.

Last month, as Breitbart News reported, President Trump gave his strong support to L.A.’s Olympic bid after meeting with the International Olympic Committee: “I would love to see the Olympics go to Los Angeles. I think that it’ll be terrific. The United States committee’s members have asked me to speak up about it, and I have, and I think I’ve helped them, and let’s see what happens.”

In contrast, Sykes said, President Obama had been noncommittal, following his lackluster role in Chicago’s failed bid to host the 2016 games.

“He [Obama] never went to an Olympic games, never met with the IOC [International Olympic Committee] leadership, never talked to them by phone, and showed sort of a disregard and that was deeply frustrating to the leaders of the IOC,” Sykes told KPCC.

Sykes also acknowledged that Trump’s role was a “double-edged sword,” given global opposition to some of his policies, as well as bad media coverage.

In February, former L.A. mayor (and 2018 gubernatorial candidate) Antonio Villaraigosa worried openly that Trump’s immigration policies would hurt the city’s Olympic bid.

2024 would mark the 40th anniversary of the highly successful 1984 Summer Olympics, dominated for Americans by memories of Carl Lewis’s four-gold-medal sweep (and only somewhat marred by a Soviet bloc boycott).

The other contender to host the 2024 games is Paris. The vote is scheduled for September.

The organizers of the annual Los Angeles gay pride have announced that this year’s march will be replaced by a protest against President Donald Trump.

Local West Hollywood news outlet wehoville.com revealed late last that “the annual pride parade has been canceled, ceding to the nationwide LGBT Resist March that is scheduled in many U.S. cities for Sunday, June 11, the day the Los Angeles pride parade would normally occur.”

There will still be a smaller “Pride Festival,” which will be smaller than usual for non-political reasons: West Hollywood Park, the traditional venue for the event, will be under renovation.

In a press statement, Christopher Street West, the organization that stages L.A. Pride Parade and Festival, said: “Given the current political climate where divisiveness and discrimination continue to be part of mainstream dialogue, CSW is determined to make the LA Pride brand a unifying force for the LGBTQ+ community and its allies across all of Los Angeles. ”

West Hollywood’s culture of tolerance, however, has been tested by the rise of Donald Trump. Though Trump has been quite sympathetic to gay rights, and has inspired a vocal group of gay supporters, he has been rejected by gay activists inclined to regard any Republican as a potential threat, and hostile to the notion of states’ rights on issues they consider fundamental.

A local official tried to ban Trump from West Hollywood last year, and a woman assaulted a Trump supporter in a local restaurant.

There are “a quarter-million to a half-million people expected to participate in the march,” wehoville.com reports. LAist.com adds that some gay rights activists are excited about politicizing the parade. It quotes organizer Brian Pendleton, via Queerty: “We want to resist apathy. We want to resist having our rights rolled back by an unenlightened administration. And we want to be all-inclusive. We want to make sure that it’s everyone in the rainbow spectrum out there being represented.”

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) – With his flamboyant shock of blonde-dyed hair and fiery anti-Islam rhetoric, Dutch politician Geert Wilders comes across a man who doesn’t mind the limelight.

Yet for the past dozen years, the right-wing populist has spent much of his time holed up in anonymous safe houses or in a heavily guarded wing of Parliament.

Tight security surrounds Wilders night and day, and he hardly ventures outdoors. For his handful of campaign events ahead of a March 15 election, he traveled in convoys of armored cars.

“It’s a total lack of freedom. That’s how I would say it,” Wilders, who leads the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, told The Associated Press in a recent interview.

The elaborate protection apparatus that surrounds him is a reaction to death threats from extremists enraged by his fierce criticism of Islam.

Wilders has made headlines and drawn condemnation for more than a decade for his anti-Islam rhetoric, which has included comparing the Quran with Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and calling for a tax on the veils some Muslim women wear.

At the same time, support for his party has grown in fits and starts, mirroring what he calls a “Patriotic Spring” sweeping Europe. Despite slipping in the polls recently, the Party for Freedom remains on track to become one of the biggest parties in the 150-seat lower house.

He also is regularly compared to President Donald Trump, for his policies and also his penchant for communicating via Twitter.

As protests and riots unfolded this weekend in Rotterdam over a Dutch government decision to block the visits of two Turkish ministers, Wilders fired off regular incendiary tweets.

“Go away and never come back … and take all your Turkish fans from The Netherlands with you please. #byebye,” he said in one as Turkey’s family affairs minister was at the center of a tense standoff at the Turkish consulate.

His one-page election manifesto is light on economic policy and heavy on pledges to “de-Islamize” the Netherlands, a nation of 17 million where an estimated 5 percent of the adult population is Muslim.

Wilders calls Islam a threat to western democracy and vows to close all mosques and ban the Quran, if he wins power.

But he has alienated so much of the political mainstream that even if he wins the popular vote he is considered unlikely to be able to form a ruling coalition in a nation where no single party has ever ruled alone.

Crucially, Prime Minister Rutte has ruled out working together after the election. Polls show Rutte’s center-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy with the most voter support in the days leading up to Wednesday’s election.

Rutte rejects Wilders’ polarizing rhetoric, but also harbors hard feelings over Wilders’ decision to effectively torpedo Rutte’s first minority government in 2012.

After weeks of negotiations on a tough austerity package, Wilders, who pledged to prop up the government by marshaling party lawmakers for key votes, backed out, forcing fresh elections.

“We know they walk away when the going gets tough, “that they make problems bigger not smaller,” Rutte said of the Party for Freedom.

Even so, Wilders’ message has found strong support in a nation known for its long history of religious tolerance and personal freedoms.

Wilders’ opposition to Islam dates back to the days when he could still move freely around the world. In his youth he lived in Israel, which he saw as a democratic oasis surrounded by oppressive regimes in the Middle East.

After working for a Dutch government welfare organization, Wilders gravitated into politics and joined the party now led by Rutte. But he quit in 2004 over his opposition bringing Turkey into the European Union.

Two years later, he formally established the PVV, the Dutch acronym for the Party for Freedom.

Wilders set up his party so that he is its only member, allowing him to keep a tight rein on its message and lawmakers.

Wilders “rules his kingdom like an emperor,” brother Paul Wilders said in a recent interview with Dutch broadcaster RTL. “Whoever contradicts him is finished, family or not.”

The extraordinary security measures that surround him were put in place after an Islamic extremist murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh in Amsterdam street in November 2004.

Wilders, already an outspoken critic of Islam, was whisked with his wife, Krisztina, into a netherworld of heavily guarded safe houses due to fears that he could become the next victim.

He says he misses the routines of a conventional life.

“Not being able to do all the things normal people can do from … emptying your own mail box, to doing some shopping or walking freely or driving my own car,” Wilders said. “It’s all impossible, and there is always that threat that people might do something.”

The circumstances haven’t caused Wilders to hold his tongue.

He was acquitted of hate speech charges in 2011, but found guilty in a separate trial last year of insulting and inciting discrimination against Moroccans.

He is appealing the conviction. Just last month, he blamed what he called “Moroccan scum” for street crime.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac321cfbb:e1f691:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Marine Le Pen is supported by a quarter of young voters in France, a poll has revealed, matching support within the age group for her liberal rival Emmanuel Macron.

The 18 to 24-year-old age bracket is usually notably liberal and broadly opposed to all expressions of nationalism, including Brexit and the election of U.S. President Donald J. Trump.

Yet in France, some 24 per cent of this group told pollsters they intended to vote for the populist candidate and her Front National party in the first round of the presidential vote on the 24th of August.

The young, photogenic centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, who served as economy minister under outgoing president François Hollande, also gained 24 per cent of their support in the Harris Interactive survey for French radio station RTL.

Another 19 per cent of those interviewed wanted the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon to win the presidency and 14 per cent said they were rooting for hard-leftist Benoît Hamon of the Socialist party.

This means that Ms. Le Pen is more popular than both left-wing candidates in the first round of voting among young people. In the second round, they will likely unite against her and she will lose.

Meanwhile, only 10 per cent of voters aged 18 to 24 said they would be backing the centre-right Republican Party candidate François Fillon, who was the favourite to win before becoming embroiled in a corruption scandal.

Furthermore, in a supposed age of political apathy 80 per cent of the 808 people interviewed between the 2nd and 6th of March told pollsters they were “interested” in politics, and were keeping a “keen eye” on the presidential race.

However, Ms. Len Pen has stressed her scepticism towards polls during the presidential race, after pollsters failed to predict the Brexit vote or President Trump’s victory.

“Polls are not the election”, she told RTL on Tuesday.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac321cfbb:e1f68e:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

With news flooding the media that President Donald Trump has requested the resignations of 46 U.S. attorneys appointed by Barack Obama, Politico’s coverage slapped Trump with a headline screaming that the president was about to unceremoniously “oust” Obama’s appointees.

Back in 2009, Politico had a much less sensational headline when reporting on all the Bush-era U.S. attorneys that Obama fired.

For its March 10 article on the Trump administration’s decision to ask for resignation letters from 46 Obama-appointed U.S. attorneys — an action fully within Trump’s legal right and one many other presidents also executed — Politico chose a headline that clearly cast Trump’s actions in a negative light.

Politico reporter Josh Gerstein’s piece reporting on the president’s move was sharply titled, “Trump team ousts Obama-appointed U.S. attorneys.”

Gerstein opened his coverage by insisting that the Trump administration’s action was “a seemingly abrupt move that surprised many.” And the writer went on to cast it as untoward and “politically fraught,” giving voice to several people critical of Trump’s move.

But Politico was not nearly as antagonistic about presidents replacing a past chief executive’s U.S. attorneys back in 2009 when Barack Obama did the same thing Trump just did.

In 2009, Politico’s article on Obama’s decision to begin firing Bush-era attorneys was blandly entitled, “Obama to replace U.S. Attorneys.” Noticeably missing was the negative “oust” thrown atTrump. Instead, a milder “replace” was used to describe Obama’s actions.

The 2009 article was also written as a straight news piece with no negative connotations, no finger wagging, and no voices of opposition. In fact, the closest Politico got to negativity in 2009 was to say that Obama’s order “began to resolve the questions” over whether Obama would fire Bush’s attorneys in light of the trouble Bush got into from the left when he fired some of Clinton’s appointees back in 2006.

Finally, to put an even finer point on the bias exhibited between the two articles, the writer of the 2009 piece was none other than Josh Gerstein, the same writer responsible for the attack on Trump’s resignation request today.

You can practically taste the bias here:

Liberal media bias at its finest: Obama “replaces” US attorneys, Trump “ousts” them.

During a discussion of President Donald Trump’s claims that the Obama administration wiretapped conversations in Trump Tower on Saturday’s “AM Joy,” MSNBC contributor Malcolm Nance said that “we have a conspiracy theory president,” adding that he is not sure you can put those words along with “president.”

“We have a conspiracy theory president, and I’m not even sure whether you can put those three words together in a tangible sentence, and actually use the word ‘president,&apos;” Nance told host Joy Reid. “He seems to be buying every crazy idea that’s out there.”

Later, Nance added, “I mean, we have got a very serious problem here. This man may be in a position where he will start causing true harm to American democracy. Because he doesn’t know the difference between what American democracy is and the crazy things which he’s told by people like Steve Bannon, and other parts of the, you know, alt-right world.”

This week, Speaker Paul Ryan and House leadership introduced an Obamacare replacement bill. They said it was the culmination of months of discussion and input with members of the GOP caucus in the House. “We listened to our members,” they said, and this was the result.

It turns out that isn’t the case at all. The House Freedom Caucus and conservative groups like Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, Freedomworks and Club For Growth—among others—came out opposing the plan. And the furor began. What’s being revealed as this plays out is the real challenge it will be to “drain the swamp.” And as the fault lines between conservatives and leadership in the House widen, the Trump agenda is truly at risk.

Paul Ryan in his now famous “PowerPoint Press Conference” sent a message to the House Freedom Caucus and conservative groups. “They don’t understand the reconciliation process,” he said. He drew a line in the sand against to their efforts when he said, “The time is here. The time is now. This is the moment, and this is the closest this will ever happen. It really comes down to a binary choice.”

It’s a binary choice over something which has no costs associated with it. The Congressional Budget Office has not released their report on its budget effect. And some members of Congress are openly concerned the report might show severe impacts on future spending. House leadership hasn’t been forthcoming on the fiscal impact either.

Paul Ryan has been sending a message to conservatives. He is telling them to either accept the plan or not. And while conservatives aren’t yet falling into line, an effort to oppose them during the 2018 campaign is beginning to emerge. It may be a repeat leadership’s 2016 efforts to take out conservative members.

Just this week, a group began a $500,000 ad campaign targeting 30 House Freedom Caucus members calling upon them to support what is now being called Ryancare. Similar efforts were initiated against Freedom Caucus members like Paul Gosar (R-AZ) and Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) last year taking out Huelskamp.

Ultimately, Paul Ryan is causing severe harm to the agenda of President Trump. The Speaker knew the bill he released would have strong opposition from conservatives. Sen. Rand Paul was already explaining the reasons for opposition when he complained how the House was hiding the bill in the last few weeks. As the politics in the House continues to deteriorate, there is speculation that while feigning support for the President’s agenda, House leadership is using the legislation to set up an electoral fight with conservatives next year.

I found myself in the middle of this give and take serving Cong. Tim Huelskamp as his Chief of Staff. Immediately after the 112th Congress began in January 2011, leaders in the House offered a spending cut of $38.5 billion in the budget. They claimed they were taking aggressive steps to get spending under control. But no CBO report had been issued to confirm that number. Our office found the actual CBO research which revealed the cut was only $352 million (not ‘billion’ but ‘million’). House leadership was apparently hiding the report. We released it to a furor of condemnation in the House. I met with Boehner’s Chief of Staff Barry Jackson. He was furious. I’ll just say this meeting set the tone for the ongoing backlash against House Freedom Caucus members and John Boehner ever since.

A typical pattern emerged in the House after 2011. Bills were written in the Speaker’s office. They were forced through the committees with limited amendments. They proceeded to the Rules committee which is stacked with members loyal to the speaker. Conservative amendments were killed there. And the bill reached the floor with rules taking away the right of members to amend the bill.

Conservatives have been shut out of the process for years. And it seems nothing has changed.

The House could have offered a full repeal bill. Speaker Ryan is making a passionate plea against the idea saying it would be filibustered in the Senate and die. But experts are saying that might not be the case at all.

Reconciliation is a mystery to the average American—mostly because members of Congress make it so. Reconciliation is a process created through the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that allows changes to budget items to “reconcile” with the then current budget on a simple majority vote. Spending items only are allowed under Reconciliation.

Some experts believe Congress can pass a full repeal of Obamacare in a reconciliation bill. Paul Winfree of the Heritage Foundation argued this in a Politico article last November:

“…it is clear that those rules are inseparable from the rest of the ACA’s structure. In fact, the Obama administration argued this before the Supreme Court in King v. Burwell, the case over whether enrollees who buy insurance through the federal exchange are eligible for subsidies. As a result, Congress may repeal those regulations via reconciliation.”

The Senate Parliamentarian could certainly rule against a bill with full repeal language, but there is a simple fix to that. The presiding officer can rule against the parliamentarian, and the Senate can overrule her with a simple majority vote.

GOP leadership in the Senate and House know this. But they are unwilling to take the risk.

This is where President Trump can use his political heft to bring a solution. And it just might save his agenda from an initial defeat.

He can sit down with Speaker Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and conservatives and hash out a full repeal now. President Trump can send Mike Pence to the Senate to override any negative ruling by the parliamentarian, and Obamacare can go to the ash heap of history.

The Swamp doesn’t want this. But Donald Trump could once again defy the odds and make winning great again.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ac0a81fd2:b9abf5:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Comedian and left-wing activist Chelsea Handler took to Twitter Saturday and posted a vulgar message questioning the sex lives of Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Mitch McConell, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.

“I can’t believe @tedcruz wife still fucks him,” Handler’s wrote. “Is anyone fucking @SpeakerRyan ? Oh, right. @MitchMcConell takes care of that.”

I can&apos;t believe @tedcruz wife still fucks him. Is anyone fucking @SpeakerRyan ? Oh, right. @MitchMcConell takes care of that. — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 11, 2017

Handler has never been below attacking the wives of her political opponents, Cruz’s wife notwithstanding.

In a January interview with Variety at the Sundance Film Festival, Handler said she’d never invite Melania Trump on her Netflix talk show because the first lady “can barely speak English.” Melania Trump is fluent in several languages, including her native Slovenian, French, Serbian, and German.

Two days later, Handler attacked Barron Trump.

In a tweet which appeared to condone a Saturday Night Live writer’s attack on the 10-year-old son of the president and first lady, Handler wrote: “It’s interesting that a writer on SNL is held to a higher standard of language than the man we elected @POTUS @katiemaryrich #stupid.”

The 42-year-old Clinton supporter has spent her post-election days protesting the Trump administration.

Handler sported a pussyhat and led a large group of demonstrators at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah for the Women’s March on Main, a march to protest Trump’s inauguration.

Let&apos;s all give each other hope #WomensMarch #MarchOnMain pic.twitter.com/iy8oM1HqdJ — Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) January 22, 2017

While Chandler told Variety earlier this month that “divisiveness is not the answer,” her continued attacks on the wives of Republican leaders suggest she’s still bitter about Clinton’s devastating defeat.

A one-on-one meeting last week between President Donald Trump and TMZ founder Harvey Levin made several staffers at the celebrity gossip site “uncountable,” The Wrap reports.

“All I can tell you is everyone thinks it’s really gross,” one source reportedly said, referring to an hour-long Oval Office confab between Trump and Levin.

“Many people in the newsroom are uncomfortable with Harvey’s overall Trump coverage,” the source reportedly added.

The New York Times reported last week that Levin and Trump were meeting to discuss a possible sit-down interview similar to the one the pair did last fall for Levin’s Fox News special Objectified: Donald Trump.

“The show was a huge success, and the two were discussing future opportunities,” Hope Hicks, White House director of strategic communications, told the Times.

The Wrap cited several examples of TMZ’s news reporting throughout the presidential campaign that staffers at the Los Angeles-based news giant said amounted to a “pro-Trump tone.”

“It’s troubling,” said Angelo Carusone, president of left-wing blog Media Matters. “TMZ has been running interference for Donald Trump from Day 1.”

Trump and Levin’s White House chat also caught the attention of late night host Jimmy Kimmel, who mocked the meeting.

“What could those two have to talk about for an hour?” the ABC host joked. “Is there a terrorist plot against Taylor Swift we need to know about? Is ISIS after Louis from 1D?”

A former Secret Service agent who served in the security details of both Presidents Bush and Obama warned on Saturday that President Donald Trump “is not secure in the White House right now as it stands.”

Dan Bongino, who was also an instructor at the training academy of the Secret Service, was commenting on Friday night’s reported breach of the White House complex, at least the seventh such incident in recent years.

Bongino stated: “If one guy with a backpack and Omar Gonzales with a bad knee could get near the residence of the White House, can you tell me with a straight face that a forty-man tactical assault team with heavy weapons wouldn’t take that place down?”

Bongino was referring to a 2014 incident in which Gonzales penetrated the north portico doors of the White House, reportedly brandishing a three-and-a-half-inch folding knife in a back pocket.

“This is inexcusable,” Bongino said of the latest incident. “How many of these are we, as the citizenry, going to tolerate, whether under Barack Obama or now President Trump, before there is enough citizen outrage that the Secret Service actually does something?”

Bongino is the author of the bestselling 2013 book Life Inside the Bubble: Why a Top-Ranked Secret Service Agent Walked Away from It All. He also previously ran as a Republican for Congress and the Senate.

He was speaking in an interview set to air Sunday on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.

“The secret service is not ready right now to defend the White House,” he charged. “They’re not. I know that may make people uncomfortable. And frankly, Aaron, I am really getting tired of some of the talking heads on cable news who have never done one minute in the shoes a secret service agent.”

“They have no idea what the security plan of the White House actually looks like on the ground. They’re all sitting here brushing it under the rug, going, ‘Oh no.’ ‘They were prepared.’ ‘This was a manageable incident.’ ‘This was how it was supposed to work.’ You really believe this is how it was supposed to work?”

Regarding Friday night’s breach, Bongino warned, “Do you think that what happened today is not being beamed into every terrorists’ head, going, ‘Look at this fellows.’ I am sounding the alarm hoping and praying with fingers crossed that somebody wakes up and finally does what needs to be done.”

Bongino offered some security upgrade suggestions: “They need to fix the fence. Reinforce the manpower on the north and the south grounds. Add special weapons teams. Get the best technology in there right now. Clearly the technology sensors and cameras are not working as planned. Get them in there yesterday. There’s no other solution.”

Bongino outlined what he says are three major problems facing the Secret Service and the White House security plan.

Problem number one, according to Bongino, involves staffing:

They have had a brain drain of catastrophic portions in the Secret Service. They lost some of the best agents. If this wasn’t a public radio show that people could hear, I could tell you the names of ten or twenty top-notch, tier one guys who left the president’s detail just in the last 5 years who I still communicate with… They have had an even worse brain drain in the uniformed division side. They are responsible for the perimeter of the White House. …You can’t run a security agency without security officers who know what they’re doing. You just can’t.

Problem number two, Bongino contended, is a lack of political will to address the purported security flaws:

The management of the Secret Service right now is grossly unprepared for the evolving threats. Grossly. They say they are but they have no political will because a lot of them are out there – not all – but a lot are looking for their next consulting job. They are just praying that nothing happens on their next watch. They don’t want to be the ones to go on Capitol Hill to say this whole security plan around the White House needs to be fixed.

And problem number three involves the actual security plan, he says:

They are way too concerned right now, the management, with the optics of White House security. That we can’t make this look like an armed camp. The prior staff didn’t like that. There other entities around the White House that want to preserve the historic look of it. But do you want a secure White House grounds or do you want it to look pretty?

CNN reported on Friday night’s breach:

A man carrying a backpack was arrested Friday night after breaching security at the White House complex and was discovered by a Secret Service officer by the south entrance to the executive residence, officials said. The incident happened just before midnight while President Donald Trump was at the White House. The suspect, who had a California driver’s license, told Secret Service officers that he was there to see the president.

Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus Rep. Mark Meadows (R.-N.C.) told Breitbart News on Friday that he will work with moderate Republicans to pass better Obamacare repeal-and-replace legislation than the bill offered by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wis.) — as part of his understanding with President Donald Trump.

“Based on my conversations with the president and the vice-president, they want to get it right, and they want to get it done quickly,” said Meadows. “They also want to make sure they reduce premiums for Americans–and when that happens, we’re in total solidarity with our president and vice-president.”

The congressman said the American Health Care Act does not have the mechanisms to reduce premiums, nor costs, until further on down the path of replacement of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

“I want to applaud the president, having met with him yesterday,” he said.

“He’s negotiating in good faith. I committed to him that I would negotiate in good faith,” Meadows said. “The only troubling thing that I continue to hear is that no amendments are going to be going to be allowed to be made in order. Certainly, no amendments were supported by either of the chairmen in either of the committees of jurisdiction.”

As part of his good faith commitment to the president, Meadows said he would work with more moderate Republicans, whose districts are less conservative than his, in order to find common ground.

One of the frustrations Capitol Hill conservatives are dealing with is the contrast between the 2o17 repeal effort and the 2015 repeal effort.

In December 2015, Republicans in the House and Senate passed an Obamacare repeal bill authored by Rep. Tom Price (R.-Ga.). Price is a physician and now the secretary of Health and Human Services, but in 2o15, he was the chairman of the House Budget Committee. The Price bill was the “root and branch” repeal conservatives demanded from the party. Although it was vetoed by President Barack Obama, conservatives expected the return of the 2015 bill as the opening move, followed by a replacement bill that combined parts of Obamacare that had already become part of the national consensus and a transition period that gave the economy and body politic time to adjust.

The RyanCare bill was crafted to be “RepealPlus,” Meadow said.

“The 2015 bill that all of us vote on? He doesn’t want to do,” he said. “He is saying that the reason why he doesn’t want to do the 2015 bill is that it won’t pass in the Senate. Well, my encouragement is to send it over to the Senate and let them amend it and then they can send it back to us.”

I support my friends @RandPaul, @SenMikeLee, and @tedcruz. Every tax, every mandate, every regulation of #Obamacare needs to go. https://t.co/zdlxLYRrqF — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) February 28, 2017

Meadows said he does bank on promises of future reform and adjustments.

“In Washington, D.C., you have to make the assumption that the only thing that is going to get done is the one thing you are voting on today,” he said. “History shows us that if count on just the thing you are voting on today to get done, that is a more prudent calculation than assuming that you vote on something and assuming you’ll get three or four things that may or may not happen.”

This back-and-forth between the two chambers is the normal legislative process Ryan and the Republican leadership are hoping to avoid. If the RyanCare bill can progress through the House and Senate unchanged, then there is no need for a conference to reconcile two versions of the same bill. In a conference, the power shifts to the Senate from the House because a senator chairs the conference committee. For Ryan, the additional risk is that a conference committee is free to produce whatever bill they come up with for votes in the House and Senate.

There is a suspicion on Capitol Hill that the RyanCare language is frozen because of agreements made between the Republican leadership and insurance company representatives when the bill was written. Certainly, it is strange for a bill to be touted as the return of “regular order” when it was developed outside the committees, without hearings.

It also has not escaped notice among conservatives that not a single Republican member of either the Ways and Means Committee nor the Energy and Commerce Committee offered amendments to the RyanCare bill in their committee markups.

Ryan dropped his bill Monday at 6 p.m., as members were coming back to Washington from the weekend recess and with no outreach to conservative media.

A leadership staffer familiar with the RyanCare rollout told Breitbart News that the rollout was part of the party’s 200-day plan that takes Capitol Hill Republicans from January through Labor Day.

January and February were devoted to confirmations and regulatory relief through the Congressional Review Act, the staffer said.

March is devoted to passing leadership’s health care bill, the staffer said.

The RyanCare bill is meant to be the first phase of the process, and it is written in such a way as to preserve its status as a privileged motion through the budget reconciliation process. Republicans hold a 52-to-48 majority in the Senate, but for regular legislation, there is a 60-vote requirement to close debate and bring up a vote.

Because the Republicans do not have the 60 votes required for cloture, they must use the budget track, which means the repeal bill can only address budget-related issues. Further changes to the PPACA legislation are vulnerable to Democratic efforts to extend debate indefinitely as long as they control 41 votes.

This maneuver is the filibuster and Republicans are anticipating that once the financial underpinnings of Obamacare are restricted through the budget bill, enough Democrats will participate in the process to pass the additional phases of replacement.

As a practical matter, the House Republican Leadership must get to 216 votes, not 218, because there are five vacant House seats. The House Freedom Caucus does not list its members publicly, but during the 2015 fight to remove-and -replace Speaker John Boehner (R.-Ohio), it was accepted that the HFC was solid for 30 votes.

With 237 sitting Republicans, 22 defections are enough to kill the RyanCare bill on the floor.

In the recent past, so many Republicans have bucked the House GOP leaders that the Republicans needed Democratic votes to pass leadership’s compromises with Obama and the Democrats. There were 67 Republicans who voted against the Dec. 11, 2014 “Cromnibus” budget deal. Sixty-two Republicans voted against Ryan’s two-year budget agreement with Democrats in 2013. In the so-called fiscal cliff vote Jan. 1, 2013, 151 Republicans voted against the Republican leadership.

But these votes were before Ryan took the gavel and Trump moved into the White House.

The next hurdle for the American Health Care Act is the House Budget Committee, chaired by Rep. Diane Black (R.-Tenn.).</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15abfaffd67:ab7e99:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Virginia Republican congressman Dave Brat told Breitbart News Saturday radio host Matt Boyle that the American Health Care Act bill written by Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wis.) is designed to save the insurance companies, not return health insurance and health care delivery to the free market.

Brat said the speaker is worried about the insurance companies, who backed the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, because the system they created cannot be sustained because of its perverse incentives, regulations, and costs.

In addition to the flaws in the Obamacare legislation and buildout, the congressman said it is foolish to attempt a political solution to an economic problem that forces you to accommodate the needs and values of 300 million Americans — such as people in both California and Texas — at the same time.

The RyanCare bill is not connected to the promises President Donald Trump made on the campaign trail, said the former head of the economic department at Randolph-Macon College.

“We want Trump to be hugely successful, so we don’t want to handle a bill that’s going to fail in a few years,” he said.

“Trump ran on price-discovery and competition across state lines, getting the price down — the price is going up by 20 percent and the bill we are getting ready to vote on, once again, goes back and does too much emphasis on the coverage aspect,” he said.

Focusing on coverage makes it impossible for the bill to ever work, he said.

“Five percent of the people with pre-existing conditions, et cetera — very serious issues that every bill deals with — but five percent of the folks will cost 50 percent of the entire health care market,” he said.

A pre-existing condition has nothing to do with insurance, because the person already had the problem, he said. “That is not an insurance problem. That is a health care problem, and we’ve got to fix that. For the rest of the 300 million, we’ve got to design an efficient system that follows free-market logic, where you get to go shop.”

Obamacare has many rules and restrictions governing how the insurance companies structure policies and run their own firms, he said.

Lifting the regulatory burden on the insurance industry would free them to innovate, he said

“In the current bill, I’ve asked leadership, budget committee experts: ‘Can a young person go out and buy a health care insurance product of their choosing?’ The answer is no,” he said.

The reason is that the regulations on the insurance companies require certain “essential health care benefits,” so that everyone in the country is forced to buy the same coverage, whether they need it or not,” Brat said.

In the RyanCare bill, the individual mandate was supposed to go away, but instead, it is reconfigured as a continuing care option tied to the pre-existing condition protections, he said. Under Ryancare someone can go without insurance for 10 years and then upon learning they have cancer, sign up for “insurance.”

Brat said the only penalty would be a 30 percent surcharge upon their premiums. “It is a perverse economic system.”

The congressman said nothing makes the politics of the RyanCare bill more plain than the fact that in 2015, Republicans in the House and Senate passed a flat-out repeal of Obamacare — when everyone knew it would be vetoed by President Barack Obama. Now with real bullets, Republicans are stepping away from repeal to put forward a RyanCare bill that preserves the structure and spirit of Obamacare.

The speaker’s bill is unlikely to pass the House, but even if it makes it to the Senate, it will not pass there, either, Brat said.

Then, hopefully, the Republican leadership will work with Capitol Hill conservatives to craft a true repeal of Obamacare that synchs up with what Trump promised the American people, Bratt concluded.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15abf947bfd:a9aa7f:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump stated that the Obamacare replacement put forth by House Republicans “follows the guidelines I laid out in my recent address to Congress” and is “part of a three-pronged reform process.”

Transcript as Follows:

“My fellow Americans,

In March, we celebrate Women’s History Month, honoring the countless contributions that women leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs have made throughout American history. We are a greater, stronger, and more just Nation today because of women like Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, and so many others.

We honor them and we recommit ourselves to a better future for every woman in America today.

On my 50th day in office, I want to talk about an issue of paramount importance to families across our nation – healthcare.

Seven years ago this month, Obamacare was signed into law over the profound objections of American people. Our citizens were told they would have to pass Obamacare to find out what it was and how bad it was.

Now we know that the hundreds of pages were full of broken promises.

Americans were promised that Obamacare would bring premiums down $2,500 for a typical family. Instead, they’ve gone up by more than $4,000.

Americans were promised that Obamacare would increase competition and provide them with more choices. Instead, the number of plans to choose from has plummeted – and I mean plummeted.

This year, Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges – or, in effect, no real choice at all.

Americans were promised that if they liked their health insurance and their doctors, they could keep them. Instead, millions of Americans lost the insurance and lost the doctor that they liked and were thrust into a cold new reality of higher costs and less coverage.

Through seven long years of botched rollouts, soaring costs, cancelled plans, and bureaucratic mandates, Americans have called out for relief. And relief is what we are determined to give them.

I want every American to know that action on Obamacare is an urgent necessity.

The law is collapsing around us, and if we do not act to save Americans from this wreckage, it will take our healthcare system all the way down with it. If we do nothing, millions more innocent Americans will be hurt – and badly hurt.

That’s why we must repeal and replace Obamacare.

House Republicans have put forward a plan that gets rid of this terrible law and replaces it with reforms that empower states and consumers.

You will have the choice and the freedom to make the decisions that are right for your family. The House plan follows the guidelines I laid out in my recent address to Congress – expanding choice, lowering costs, and providing healthcare access for all.

This plan is part of a three-pronged reform process. In concert with the plan in front of Congress, I have directed Dr. Tom Price, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, to use his authority to reduce regulations that are driving up costs of care.

We are also working on reforms that lower the costs of care, like allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines. You’ve heard me say that many, many times during the debates.

I encourage Democrats to work with us to improve the healthcare system for the American people. Also, we will be driving down the costs.

We will deliver relief to American workers, families, and small businesses, who right now are being crushed by Obamacare, by increasing freedom, choice, and opportunity for the American people.

Thank you very much.”

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee and the first major GOP figure to endorse President Donald Trump, is calling out House Speaker Paul Ryan for what she says is “RINO-Care.”

Ryan introduced what he calls the “American Health Care Act,” a bill that does not repeal Obamacare but only amends it. For the last several days, senior Republicans ranging from members of the House Freedom Caucus to other House Republicans to Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and more have raised serious concerns with the bill. Some call it Obamacare 2.0, others call it Obamacare Lite or Ryan-care, and now Palin—in her first interview on the topic, coming on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend—calls it “RINO-Care.”

“I do want to speak about this, but I am tempted to say not another word from our fearless leaders about this new form of Obamacare that I’m going to call RINO-care—not another word from them until we are definitively told that there is no provision whatsoever allowing Congress to exempt itself whatsoever with this law,” Palin said. “As with anything else mandated by Congress, every single dotted I and crossed T better apply to them, too, and not just the people who they are lording this thing over because remember this is government-controlled health care, the system that requires enrollment in an unaffordable, unsustainable, unwanted, unconstitutional continuation of government-run medicine, and even in this new quasi-reformed proposal, there is still an aspect of socialism. That’s the whole premise here.”

Palin expressed serious concern with the fact that Ryan’s healthcare bill does not eliminate Obamacare’s individual mandate. It just shifts the mandate—which requires all Americans to purchase a health insurance plan even if they do not want one. Under Obamacare, those who do not comply, pay a tax to the federal government. Under Ryan’s plan, those who not comply, pay a fee to the insurance companies.

“This 30 percent additional fee will be collected by some in the private sector, which will mean politicians are allowed again to pick the winners and losers, and it makes you wonder who’s lobbying hardest for aspects of this new bill because obviously there are special interests involved. Otherwise, certain private sector segments of our economy wouldn’t be rewarded as they will be with this fee, instead of going to the IRS going to private companies,” Palin said. “It would be really helpful if every single one of these politicians would do like the NASCAR drivers do—and it’s been said before—but let them wear their sponsors plastered all over their three-piece suits when they show up so we know what side they’re on and who they’re actually doing their bidding for.”

At this time, House GOP leadership officials are refusing to answer which lobbyists specifically were involved in writing the bill and which lobbyists wrote which parts of the legislation. Palin told Breitbart News that it’s a “great question” for leadership officials that they should answer because the public deserves to know.

“That’s a great question. That’s a great question,” Palin said when informed of the fact that House GOP leaders have refused to answer which lobbyists were involved in writing the legislation. “The people want to know with this RINO-Care, we know that it helps Big pharma and big lobbyists who need big government to stay in business. We want to and have the right to know who’s actually putting pen to paper and writing this because we know the politicians don’t write the laws.”

Palin also praised Cotton and Paul and Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), among others, who are standing up and pushing back on this rush from leadership on this bill. She says that they are “right” in pushing to make sure the process is not rushed in the way that Ryan has been rushing it through the House so far. In fact, this past week, the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees stayed in session all night to ram the bill down to the next stages, rather than taking input from the American people and slowly deliberating the process of healthcare reform.

“Cotton is right. Dr. Rand Paul is right. Dave Brat is right. Some of these public servants are right in saying, ‘Let’s do it right this time’ because, remember, the rush job under Obamacare gave us what we’re having to deal with today, which is the devastating system that is again lorded over us,” Palin said. “They passed it with their rushed-through process of theirs. It’s very important that the people are allowed to see what’s in the bill before its first draft so we know what their thinking is, so we know what the difference is between Obamacare and RINO-Care.”

“But we can’t lose sight of the entire premise between the whole pro-Obamacare and the pro-RINO-care arguments,” she continued. “It’s so wrong because it’s still so unconstitutional. It’s still taxation without representation. It still picks winners and losers because some corporations get to opt out of the requirements that hit everyone else. It still infringes on states’ rights, and it still weaponizes the IRS against Americans who just simply seek freedom and choices and sensibility in their families’ health care. The IRS will be taxing aspects of this without representation because we have no choice. We’re shackled to politicians’ whims and special interests’ bullying interests, which does violate the Constitution, and it actually allows government to have a lien on our health.”

“People need to know it’s the foundation, it’s the premise,” Palin said. “I don’t know why we’re still even giving an inch on aspects of socialized medicine via this new RINO-care proposal. Is that okay with conservatives, with Republicans in office? They say they want the patient first. They say they want freedom. They say they want a free market to drive the insurance system that we have in America. But no, government is still in control. Government actually has a lien on our health because they lord over us penalties if we want to opt out of a big government mandate.”

When asked what she would say to Ryan if he were on Breitbart News Saturday with her this weekend—Ryan has refused to come on the program to discuss these matters and will not answer Breitbart News’s questions about the bill —Palin said she has lots for Ryan to explain here. But she also noted that Republicans party-wide agree that Obamacare is awful and needs to be repealed.

“There is much that we agree on,” Palin said. “Thank the Lord, we all agree that Obamacare is devastating one-sixth of our economy. That’s what health care encompasses. Once the government took it over—it obviously is unaffordable, unsustainable and unwanted. So, from the get-go, thank the Lord we all have that in common, and we want to do away with Obamacare. I would ask Paul Ryan’s forgiveness if I come across sounding like I’m just whining and complaining about a problem without proposing a solution. Like Teddy Roosevelt said, that is the definition of whining. So I want to propose solutions, and I want Paul Ryan to listen to the people who are suggesting that, okay, if government is going to be this involved in our healthcare system and choices, then allow the states to take this over. Get it out of big government’s hands. The most responsive level of government is that which is closest to the people. If you’re not going to allow individuals to have the freedoms and the autonomy and the choices provided in their health care, at least let it be a states’ rights issue. So that’s one.”

“And then let’s talk about the tort reform that I still don’t see in the new proposal,” Palin continued. “I’d like Paul Ryan to address that more clearly. I’d like him to really talk about how he proposes to tackle the waste and the fraud in the healthcare system. I’d really like him to talk about the interstate commerce allowance now because we know that that has caused a lack of competition, and I really want him to address just that good old American freedom of choice. How can he convince the American people that this isn’t just still big government in bed with big pharma and big Wall Street and sticking it to the people with all its globaloney that was part of Obamacare. How is this RINO-care any different?”

Palin concluded the interview by noting that she has the utmost confidence that President Trump will move to scrap Ryan’s bill and fix this whole process before this gets out of hand.

“He will step in and fix it,” Palin said. “I have great faith that President Trump is one who will fulfill campaign promises. He already has a track record of doing so well in these first months, I’m just really proud to have been part of the constituency that wanted him in there and worked hard to get him in there. So, yeah, I’m sure that President Trump is going to do the right thing and listen to all sides, of course, but understand, especially, that as a businessman, he’s going to understand whether this makes sense in his vision of how to grow businesses and how to get government off our back and back on our side. How will we create a smaller, smarter government with a proposal like this that basically allows for the continuation of a growth of government? That’s what any aspect of Obamacare or RINO-care does. So asking President Trump specifically about how running a business, not a Wall Street business, but mom-and-pop main street business, how does RINO-care help their business get to grow and drive and survive in this economy?”

Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle grabbed brunch with Bono in the Big Apple Friday and were greeted with cheers and applause from a crowd of onlookers.

As the Obamas and the U2 frontman exited the restaurant, People reports, “the whole restaurant stood up and applauded and cheered for them. Barack Obama waved at everyone upon leaving.”

Video of the Obamas exiting Upland Restaurant in Manhattan, flanked by Secret Service, flooded social media.

“Obama, we love you” one person is heard screaming as the crowded eatery erupts with applause.

The bromance between President Obama and Bono dates back years.

In 2010, the Grammy-winning crooner met with Obama and his national security team to “discuss the administration’s development strategy heading into the upcoming G-8 and G-20 meetings in Canada and September’s U.N. Summit on the Millenium Development Goals.”

And Friday’s was not the first brunch the Obamas and Bono have shared together.

In June 2013, Michelle Obama and her two daughters dined with Bono, his wife, and their two sons at Finnegan’s Irish Pub in Dalkey, Co Dublin.

Bono, of course, has been an outspoken opponent of President Donald Trump.

Two months before the presidential election, Bono called Trump “potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America.”

Just last month, Bono condemned the idea of a “national border” as the best way to protect one’s country from Islamic terror.

“I don’t see a body of water wide enough or a wall high enough to keep these problems from our doors,” the Irish rocker said before world leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

Vice President Mike Pence took the argument for the House Republican Leadership’s “American Health Care Act” to Americans on a warehouse floor in Kentucky on Saturday morning, admitting that there would be a “battle” in Washington, D.C., over the bill and that they “need every Republican in Congress” to get it passed.

Pence called Kentucky “a textbook example of Obamacare’s failures” as he spoke to the crowd of about 100 on the floor of a Harshaw Trane warehouse. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin introduced Pence, and Pence returned praise for Bevin during his speech that centered around the new healthcare bill.

He made the statement after highlighting health insurance woes from around the country like premiums up 25 percent on average around the country in just 2016. He said millions have lost their insurance and their doctors, and he spoke of one-third of American counties with only one insurance company available to them, “which essentially means they have no choice at all.”

“The Obamacare nightmare is about to end,” Pence promised the Kentucky crowd on Saturday. “Virtually every promise of Obamacare has been broken.”

The vice president detailed premium increases of an average 24 percent last year in Kentucky. He added that some plans spiked more than 47 percent.

Pence continued:

Nearly half of the state has only one health insurer to choose from and next year, Humana, headquartered right here in Louisville, is pulling out of Kentucky’s Obamacare exchange. Today, one third of the state is on Medicaid, and as your governor has said over and over again, it’s unsustainable, and Medicaid here is Kentucky is threatening to bankrupt this state.

Debate over the bill has come from both conservative Republicans and Democrats. House and Senate conservatives have proclaimed that the leadership’s new bill, released on Monday, does not fully repeal and replace the Obamacare plan that Democrats continue to cling to. Members of the House Freedom Caucus, including Sen. Dr. Rand Paul and others, have introduced their own clean repeal and replace bills.

President Donald Trump has welcomed discussions for better solutions as his administration has voiced support for the House Republican Leadership bill.

Pence publicly thanked Kentucky Congressman Brett Guthrie, who was in attendance, for his strong support for Obamacare repeal and replace. The vice president said that he knows not every politician supports the plan. Kentucky Congressmen Andy Barr was also in attendance.

He pledged that the plan would repeal the taxes and individual and employer mandates and penalties of Obamacare. Conservative members of Congress have criticized the House Leadership plan for provisions that they say create new mandates and penalties. Pence said that the House leadership plan will remove 500 billion dollars of Obamacare tax increases.

Pence assured that there would be tax credits to help Americans afford health insurance, that pre-existing conditions will still be covered, and American adult children can remain on their parents’ health insurance until they are 26. Each have been lauded as popular aspects of Obamacare.

He declared that the states will be given freedom and flexibility with Medicaid. Vice President Pence added, “It’s competition between the states that will give the American people better healthcare choices” and “finally allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance.”

“The way to lower the price of health insurance is to create a national marketplace and give Americans more choices to buy the insurance they want, not the insurance that the government mandates them to have,” said Pence.

“This is going to be a battle in Washington, D.C.,” he resolved. “For us to seize this opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all, we need every Republican in Congress, and we’re counting on Kentucky.”

Pence continued:

I want to assure the people of Kentucky who might be looking on this morning. We’re going to work with the Congress and work with our agency at Health and Human Services, and we’re going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system that makes affordable, high quality health insurance available for every American. We’re going to make the best healthcare system in the world even better.

Pence went on to laud the president’s plans to cut taxes for working families and small businesses, roll back regulations, and “rebuild America” to provide the best bridges, highways, and airports we have ever had. He highlighted Trump’s concern for the safety and security of Americans, support for law enforcement, and the military. He reassured that the administration is working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get criminal illegal aliens off American streets. The vice president lauded Trump’s choice of Neil Gorsuch to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court of the United States.

In the course of the speech, Pence also heralded new jobs numbers that revealed 235,000 jobs were added in the month of February alone, Trump’s first full month as President of the United States. “This economy is coming back and coming back strong,” said Pence.

“We’ve come to a pivotal moment in our nation’s history,” the vice president said as he closed. Pence implored the crowd and all Americans to join in the effort to move the House Republican Leadership plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. “We need every freedom-loving American to join with us in this effort to Make America Great Again. We need all of you to stand up, speak out, to let your voice be heard.”

“We need you to tell the world that we can do better,” Pence said, referring to health care, a growing economy, and standing tall and strong in the world. “We can restore this country – put it back to a path to a brighter future.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Secret Service says a person is under arrest after climbing a fence and getting onto the south grounds of the White House.

The breach happened at about 11:38 p.m. Friday. President Donald Trump was at the White House.

The agency says the individual – whom it did not identify – was arrested without further incident. No hazardous materials were found during a search of a backpack the individual carried.

The Secret Service also says a search of the south and north grounds of the White House complex found “nothing of concern to security operations.”

Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was briefed on the incident.

The agency didn’t provide an update on the individual’s status. Standard practice is to hand intruders over to the local police department.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15abe49a704:a3d1e9:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Amazon boss Jeff Bezos wants to apply the same principles used in Amazon’s developing delivery services to bring supplies to the future population of the moon.

After The Washington Post obtained a copy of the confidential “white paper” that Bezos’ space company Blue Origin is passing on to Trump’s transition team, the company verified its authenticity. And while Elon Musk’s SpaceX rushes to beat Trump’s own lunar ambitions, Bezos is focused on the logistics of something a little more permanent than private sightseeing excursions.

Blue Origin want to deliver cargo to the moon, paving the way for sustained human colonization of our natural satellite. They’ve even picked a spot for this potential real estate — a cheery little crater near the moon’s south pole, with access to water via ice hidden in the crater’s shadows, and enough consistent sunlight to make use of solar energy.

The thought of lunar expansion has managed to whet the appetites of several companies, who are already offering their own ideas for involvement. One such example is Bigelow Aerospace. Its founder, Robert Bigelow, wants to adapt the design of their BEAM habitat, currently docked with the International Space Station. He wants to create an orbital depot to house supplies and medical facilities.

According to Bigelow, venturing toward Mars is “premature.” As for the moon? Bigelow asserts that “We have the technology. We have the ability, and the potential for a terrific business case.” For his part, Bezos believes that “if you go to the moon first, and make the moon your home, then you can get to Mars more easily.”

Bezos says that this project “only be done in partnership with NASA,” and believes that “[Blue Origin’s] liquid hydrogen expertise and experience with precision vertical landing offer the fastest path to a lunar lander mission.” He is personally “excited about this,” to the point of investing his own money “alongside NASA,” to make sure they get there.

“Blue Moon is all about cost-effective delivery of mass to the surface of the Moon,” according to the Amazon boss. “Any credible first lunar settlement will require that capability” But all of this is just the beginning of Blue Origin’s ambitions. Their first proposed mission hopes to be just the first in “a series of increasingly capable missions.”

We’ll have to wait to see whether President Trump and his advisors are as excited about the possibilities as Bezos himself.

Tea Party activists, while critical of the healthcare bill proposed by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), are giving President Trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the process of honoring his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

“We have no doubt President Trump is on our side,” Tom Zawistowski, president of the We the People Convention and long-time Ohio Tea Party leader, tells Breitbart News.

“This is between the Tea Party movement and the conservative movement, on the one hand, and establishment Republicans, on the other hand,” the veteran Tea Party activist adds.

“We’ve seen this act before,” Zawistowski notes.

“Give us the House, we need the Senate, they say. Give us the Senate, we need the White House. Give us the White House, we need 60 votes in the Senate,” Zawistowski says.

“We’re not playing these games any more,” he declares.

“They can’t pass their bill without us. We won’t pass their bill unless we get what we want, need, and deserve — full repeal of Obamacare, and free market replacement. The Art of the Deal says people who can afford to walk away from the table win. Trump needs a deal and he needs to support our position to get one,” Zawistowski concludes.

Other Tea Party activists around the country share Zawistowski’s trust in Trump.

“I certainly understand what I believe to be the strategy of a phased approach. President Trump and Speaker Ryan have talked about a three phased approach to repeal and replace Obamacare. I understand it’s a complex issue. I trust this president,” Mark Skoda, founder of America First Tennessee and organizer of the March 4 pro-Trump Spirit of America rally in Nashville, tells Breitbart News.

“My biggest concern is that they aren’t killing the regulation. If you don’t kill the regulation, then the possibility is for another president to reinstate some form of Obamacare through that regulatory structure. I’m also concerned, as Sen. Rand Paul has suggested, that the current proposal is, in effect, a de facto continuation of the individual mandate,” Skoda adds.

“I’ve been telling people to calm down and be a little bit more strategic,” Bill Hennessy, founder of the St. Louis Tea Party, tells Breitbart News.

“Donald Trump is a better negotiator than anyone in Congress,” Hennessy says.

“The establishment thought President Trump was out of his mind when he announced he was running for president. They thought he was out of his mind when he promised to build a wall. One thing President Trump has shown, he always knows what he’s doing when it comes to setting the table for negotiations,” Hennessy concludes.

“I started out as ‘Never-Trump’ and became a Trump supporter because President Trump kept his word,” Judson Phillips, founder and president of Tea Party Nation tells Breibart News.

“President Trump promised us there will be a repeal of Obamacare, and I believe he will keep his word on that,” Phillips adds.

“What Speaker Ryan and the establishment Republicans need to realize is this: they are destroying what little good will they have with the conservative movement. That is a fight they do not wish to have. It is a fight they will end up losing long-term,” he says.

“They needed the Tea Party to take the House, take the Senate, and take the White House. If they do what they do best, which is selling out the conservative base, they will find themselves in the minority in the House and in the Senate,” Phillips concludes.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15abe12aa16:902cc8:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Daniel Levinson, son of former FBI agent Robert Levinson, is hopeful that President Trump can bring his father home after 10 years missing in Iran.

Fox News interviewed Daniel on the tenth anniversary of his father’s disappearance, shortly after the Trump White House declared it would “spare no effort” to recover Robert Levinson or learn the full story of his fate.

“The Levinson family has suffered far too much during the last decade due to the absence of Mr. Levinson, a loving father, brother, husband, grandfather and friend to many,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday. “Each and every day, but especially today, our hearts are with the Levinson family. We will not rest until this case is resolved.”

Levinson said he hoped President Trump would meet with the family, so they could convey the message that “if there’s one issue that he’s so well-suited for, it’s this one to get my dad home, because he has talked about helping to take care of the people who have been serving our country, he’s talked about being tough with America’s adversaries.”

He noted Trump has also specifically addressed the Robert Levinson case and accused Iran of knowing “exactly where he is.” In the fall of 2015, Trump promised to recover Levinson and three other Americans held in Iran; in fact, he predicted they would be returned even before he took office if he won the presidency. The other three – Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, former Marine Amir Hekmati, and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini – were released over the course of 2016, but Levinson is still missing.

Daniel Levinson said Trump is a “deal-maker,” and “this is going to require a deal.”

“I think this is an enormous opportunity for President Trump to do something that two previous U.S. presidents haven’t done,” he told Fox News.

Levinson reiterated his family’s criticism of President Obama for ignoring his father’s plight to secure the Iran nuclear deal. “He had said many times over the years that it was a top priority, but he had eight years to get him out, and he didn’t,” he said of Obama.

“I think the biggest issue with that, though, was that he was never aggressive with the Iranians. He never issued threats of repercussions for their inaction. We know that President Trump has no qualms about doing that – threatening sanctions, threatening to label the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization. So we’re hoping that he’s going to be tough,” Levinson said.

The Levinson family issued a statement on Thursday that pronounced Robert “America’s longest-held hostage in history,” and asked why there hasn’t been more outrage over “this treatment of an American citizen.” The statement reads in full:

When is enough enough? It has been 10 years since Robert Levinson, our amazing husband, father and grandfather, was arrested on Kish Island, Iran, and imprisoned. For 10 years the government of Iran has been allowed to dodge and weave every time it was asked to come clean about what happened to Bob and send him home. Where is the outrage of this treatment of an American citizen? For 10 years, over and over and over again, two U.S. Presidents abandoned him, a lifelong public servant. Even Bob’s government co-workers and their bosses – they know who they are – ran away when he disappeared, to their lasting shame. Ten years is beyond enough. How much more agony must he withstand? It is time to get Bob Levinson home to his family. And, to Bob, Dad and Grandpa Bob: Stay strong! We know you are alive and trying to come home to us. We love you more than ever. We miss you every hour of the day. We will never, never, ever give up looking for you.

“The Iranian government arrested my dad. They’ve held him for 10 years without any basic human rights. This is an American citizen. There should be outrage around the world,” Daniel Levinson said in his Fox News interview. “And they’ve been getting away with it. This is unbelievable that it has been this long, and I’m still coming out here and having to plead to get action.”

He said it was an “enormous opportunity that was squandered” when the Obama administration did not insist on Levinson’s release while negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran.

Daniel stood behind his family’s criticism of Robert Levinson’s colleagues and senior U.S. officials. “In the ensuing weeks after he first went missing, there were mistakes made. We’re trying to move past that. It’s an issue to be addressed in the future. We’re focused on getting him home. We can deal with the repercussions of that later,” he said.

“He was working for the CIA as a contractor,” Daniel elaborated. “There are the people who were tasked with working with him. They had denied it at first, and lied to the federal investigators at the FBI about his ties. So that was a big issue for us. There’s so many complex aspects to this. The focus for is is that the Iranians really have denied everything since.”

He noted that his father has “missed several weddings” and has “two grandchildren on the way” plus “several that he has never met.”

“That’s tough when our family is all together, because we have a big family, and it’s a happy time,” he said.

“We fully believe he’s alive,” Daniel said of his father. “The FBI investigators who are involved in the case on a daily basis believe he’s alive. People survive ten-year prison sentences all the time. He’s relatively young, he’s going to be 69 tomorrow. He has a lot to come home to. They think that the two most pressing health issues he has – diabetes, hypertension – those can be resolved with a limited staple diet that he’s eating over there.”

The New York Times recalls Iranian officials feeding the Obama administration a false intelligence report that Robert Levinson’s remains had been buried in a remote region of Pakistan, but no remains were discovered at the indicated location.

“American officials concluded that the report, rather than a gesture of good will, was a gambit by Iran to further cloud its role in Mr. Levinson’s fate,” the Times writes, noting that the only hard evidence remains a handful of photographs and a professionally-staged 2010 videotape that depicted him as a prisoner. The FBI believes this video was probably filmed by “a state-sponsored intelligence group such as a unit of the Revolutionary Guards Corps.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15abbb4afd1:6744b3:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” MSNBC anchor Joy Reid argued that the “bread and circuses” for President Trump’s base, “includes the persecution of people they fear, the persecution of Muslims is part of the bread and circuses, the persecution of the immigrants, throwing out DREAMers from the country, people that it’s easy for his base to hate and to fear.”

Reid said, “[T]he most cynical thing he’s done so far, is to say, I have to ban people from these seven Muslim countries. It’s urgent. I’ve got to do it now. And then, when it gets rejected by the courts, the 2nd version of this ban, actually can wait because he’s getting lauded by the press. And so, while he’s being applauded, it’s not so urgent. It can wait now.”

She added, “[T]he bread and circuses for his base includes the persecution of people they fear, the persecution of Muslims is part of the bread and circuses, the persecution of the immigrants, throwing out DREAMers from the country, people that it’s easy for his base to hate and to fear. That is part of the show he gives them instead of giving them substantive things like, I don’t know, health care.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.–There was an altercation Friday afternoon before the White House press briefing between Jon Decker from Fox News Radio and Lucian Wintrich from the website Gateway Pundit.

Multiple witnesses who saw the confrontation confirmed that Decker approached Wintrich in the back room of the press briefing and began accusing him of being a Nazi and a white supremacist who worked for a white supremacist website. Witnesses also saw Decker follow Wintrich back into the briefing room and continue to point at Wintrich and accuse him and the website he works for of being “white supremacists.”

Drama in WH press room between @lucianwintrich and Fox reporter I don&apos;t know. Not helpful for anyone. Let&apos;s stay calm everyone. — Andrew Feinberg (@agfhome) March 10, 2017

Reporter screaming at @lucianwintrich was Fox Radio&apos;s John Decker. Not helpful or professional — Andrew Feinberg (@agfhome) March 10, 2017

GatewayPundit.com, run by gay conservative Jim Hoft, is not a white supremacist website but instead is a well-known site that’s been supportive of President Donald Trump.

Wintrich told Breitbart News that Decker blocked him from the doorway and claims he was assaulted by Decker, an accusation that Breitbart News was not able to independently confirm or deny. However, all witnesses agreed that Decker initiated the conflict and made the accusations while pointing to Wintrich.

Fox News Radio John Decker just loudly told everyone in briefing room that Gateway Pundit is here &quot;they hate blacks, Jews, Hispanics.&quot; Wild — Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017

He was speaking to Lucian Wintrich. He said it twice, pointing to him, so everyone knew who he was. https://t.co/42njWQQ0fX — Adrian Carrasquillo (@Carrasquillo) March 10, 2017

Wintrich, whose grandfather was Jewish, calls the allegation of being a “white supremacist” absurd and says that the idea that he’s racially biased is totally inaccurate.

Wintrich told Breitbart News that he also finds it strange that the accusations came from Jon Decker of Fox News Radio, since FoxNews frequently links to the Gateway Pundit site.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, President Donald Trump and his supporters and associates were dogged by false accusations of racism and anti-Semitism. Recently, Democrat Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi falsely accused Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon of being a white supremacist without citing any proof whatsoever.

John Decker also asulted me, pushing me in the break room &amp; then grabbing my arm in the briefing room while shouting that I&apos;m a nazi. https://t.co/RiVM1yYCJv — Lucian B. Wintrich (@lucianwintrich) March 10, 2017

Jon Decker has denied accusations of assault, saying that he “did not get physical in any way” with Wintrich.

Trump, we are coming for you. Everyone’s talking about the Deep State now. The other day, Virgil searched “deep state” and found, just in the Google News section, no less than 3.86 million hits. Republican politicians are using the phrase, and so are Democratic pols. In fact, one Democrat, Rep. Ted Lieu of California, chose to “own” the phrase, tweeting, “We are #Deep State.” Translation:

Indeed, the Deep State hashtag is now busy, used by both fans and foes of the DS. There are even a bunch of Twitter accounts on the Deep State theme—which may or may not have any connection to reality.

And there are even plays on the phrase, such as DeepStateGate, which by now is familiar to Breitbart readers, and also “Shallow State,” an anti-Republican coinage from David Rothkopf, an appointee in the Clinton administration.

It was different back on December 12, when Virgil first started writing about the Deep State; back then, references were scarce. Yet today, if one goes to Google Trends and types in “deep state,” this is what one sees: a recent sharp spike in usage. It’s fun to have company!

And speaking of company, I’ll hope you’ll continue to join me on our tour of the Federal Triangle, the heartland of the Deep State. We started our tour at the Department of Commerce, and so next we’ll visit the federal bureaucracy in the next building over.

That would be the Environmental Protection Agency, which fills up, in fact, three different buildings, stretching from Constitution Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue, from 14th Street to 12th Street. (Plus, of course, the EPA has myriad satellite offices all over the country; the total head-count is more than 15,000, not counting contractors and grantees.)

The EPA, of course, is right in the middle of the ongoing DC power struggle, which has spilled into open bureaucratic revolt. On February 16, for example, The New York Times reported that EPA employees had brazenly been calling senators to urge them to vote against Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s pick to head the agency. It was, the Times’ Coral Davenport observed, “a remarkable display of activism and defiance that presages turbulent times ahead for the EPA.”

Speaking of turbulence, the career staff at EPA is feeling it. On March 7, Axios’ Jonathan Swan tweeted a picture of a sign at EPA, offering counseling sessions to fearful careerists:

Feeling Pressured? Worried About Change at EPA? The EPA’s Employee Counseling and Assistance Program presents a 45 min. seminar on “Dealing with Change.”

Yes, the delicate snowflakes at the agency need help—your tax dollars at work.

Yet whether they have had counseling or not, EPA-ers seem to be girded for battle. A rogue Twitter account, AltEPA, billing itself as the “resistance,” has 382,000 followers—and there are many more such accounts in existence. It’s possible, of course, that some, perhaps most, of these accounts are fakes. But probably not all.

In the meantime, some EPA people, long ago, developed their own “resistance strategies.” For instance, Lisa Jackson, the EPA administrator in Barack Obama’s first term, had a nifty Deep State tactic—she hid her identity, even with her own agency. As far back as 2009, Jackson was using a fictitious name, “Richard Windsor,” for her e-mail, in a seeming attempt to evade the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act and other transparency laws. By some reckonings, such evasion might be counted as a crime, but Jackson suffered no ill consequences. In fact, she is now a well-paid vice president at Apple.

Given that sort of no-penalty precedent, it’s little wonder that a pervasive culture of clandestine operating still permeates EPA. To illustrate, we might recall an EPA inspector general’s report prepared at the behest of the House Republicans: In 2014-2015, EPA employees sent or received 3.1 million text messages on government-issued devices; of these, just 86 were archived for the federal records. So what were all the rest of those 3-million-plus texts about? Maybe they were all personal, or maybe they were leaks, or maybe they were back-and-forths with Lisa Jackson—we’ll never know. And we can underscore: that’s just on government equipment; who knows what’s been happening on personal equipment, and on personal accounts.

So as we can see, secrecy is one weapon that EPA lifers can deploy. Another weapon is complexity. The same Times reporter on the environmental beat, Coral Davenport, recently interviewed Jackson’s successor at EPA, Gina McCarthy, who served from 2013 to 2017. McCarthy was eager to outline the torturous process that the Trump administration would have to follow to undo Obama regulations:

If you want to do these executive orders that require a whole rewrite of the rule, you have to get that right, legally. It took years to do those rules. To now ask for those things to be undone with less staff and low morale—how are they going to do it?

Yes, that’s standard Deep State stuff. As bureaucrats like to say to the political appointees of any administration, “We were here when you arrive, and we’ll still be here when you depart. In fact, by the time you figure out how things really work, it’ll be time for you to go!” In other words, the Deep State is eternal, and throughout that eternity, Deepists have mastered the arcane procedures needed to make any sort of change. So the message to interlopers is simple: Do it our way, or else face frustration, or even failure.

Moreover, perhaps more than any other government agency, the Deep Statists at EPA can call upon powerful outside allies—in the media, in partisan politics, and in the realm of litigation activism.

Let’s take a look, starting with the media. On March 8, that same Times reporter, Coral Davenport, printed the names of five aides that Scott Pruitt, having been confirmed for his post, now plans to bring with him. Just a hunch: Davenport didn’t get those names from Pruitt; instead, most likely, she got them from some EPA worker with inside access to his doings. And so the Democratic war rooms, joined by so many others, can get to work building their “oppo” dossiers on each new hire.

Meanwhile, other media outlets, too, are piling on. Thus we get dozens of Pruitt/Trump administration-bashing headlines every day. For example, here’s Slate: “Trump’s EPA Plans Are ‘Just Racist.’” And MinnPost: “Trump’s EPA cuts would undo local efforts to restore iconic places—like the Great Lakes.” And Quartz: “Leaked document details plan to starve an already malnourished EPA budget.”

Ah yes, there’s the “l” word again—“leaked.” Indeed, it seems that back on March 3, the National Association of Clean Air Agencies got its hands on a Trump administration document calling for $2 billion in cuts at EPA, and then shared it with various publications, including The Oregonian.

And then on the second bounce of that particular leak-story, as reporters sought to give it “legs,” we saw headlines such as this, in Science: “Trump plan for 40% cut could cause EPA science office ‘to implode,’ official warns.” The EPA official doing the warning, of course, was unnamed. Meanwhile, the internal communications at EPA have been leaking out in near real-time. That’s how things work in DC, every day. Warning to Trumpsters at EPA: You’re going to be parachuting in far behind enemy lines, and they know where to find you.

Now we come to a second ally of the permanent regime at EPA, the increasingly greened Democratic Party. Yes, it’s the Democrats who put the wind beneath the wings of the environmental- (anti) industrial complex.

We can recall that it was not always this way: As recently as the 1960s, the Democrats cared cared more about growing the economy than greening the environment. That is, Democrats worried about workers and their wages, and to that end, they focused on the development—the word often used back then was “reclamation”—of natural resources.

For example, the 1960 Democratic platform, the one that helped elect John F. Kennedy, was emphatic:

The new Democratic Administration will develop a comprehensive national water resource policy. In cooperation with state and local governments, and interested private groups, the Democratic Administration will develop a balanced, multiple-purpose plan for each major river basin.

Indeed, in those days, the Democrats attacked the outgoing Eisenhower administration for its alleged cheapness when it came to funding new projects:

We will erase the Republican slogan of “no new starts” and will begin again to build multiple-purpose dams, hydroelectric facilities, flood-control works, navigation facilities, and reclamation projects to meet mounting and urgent needs.

By contrast, the 2016 Democratic platform offered a much different worldview: workers and wages were an afterthought, well behind penguins and polar bears. In fact, the old concept of “reclamation” never appears at all; instead, we get 16 paragraphs, for instance, on “climate change.”

Of course, at this precise moment, in 2017, the Democrats lack the political power fully to protect their friends at EPA, although they’ll certainly always be trying.

And now to a third ally of Deep EPA: the activist litigators.

As every conservative knows, the left has been far more effective, in recent decades, at winning in the courts than winning at the ballot box. And yet on many issues, a win is a win: If a judge orders the government to take action of a certain kind, well, oftentimes that’s it—that’s the ballgame. No wonder the left is so tight with the lawyers!

And as a sign of the anti-Trump eco-litigation flood to come, on March 8, nearly three dozen green groups filed a formal legal petition with EPA, demanding that the agency tighten the regulations on concentrated animal-feeding operations (CAFO), also known as “factory farms.” As the lead plaintiff, Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food &amp; Water Watch, declared,

This petition paves the way for EPA to finally regulate CAFOs as required under the Clean Water Act, and explains that allowing CAFO pollution to continue unabated by maintaining the woefully inadequate status quo would violate federal law.

That petition, we might note, is 58 pages of closely argued legalese, boasting 294 footnotes. And there’s a clear call to action in the document’s conclusion; as it reads, “Petitioners believe that EPA has an obligation pursuant to its [Clean Water Act] duties to [take new action against CAFOs] without further delay.”

In other words, it’s a serious legal demand, aimed at forcing EPA to take additional regulatory action. Or, failing that, to persuade a judge somewhere to order such additional regulation into existence.

So now Virgil wonders: Who among Team Trump at EPA is actually going to have time to read this petition, let alone develop an appropriate legal counter-strategy?

And so what might happen if the Trump people choose to delegate the handling of this case to the EPA career staff? Well, we know what could easily happen: The Deep Statists at EPA could consult with their like-minded friends, neighbors, and former law-school classmates—quite possibly, including the very people who filed the CAFO case—and come up with a nice green answer.

That is, it’s easy to see EPA Deep Statists communicating with their friends—perhaps even their spouses—in the activist legal world. Suppose, for example, that two grocery shoppers at the Whole Foods in Northwest DC’s Tenleytown neighborhood just happen to have a friendly ex parte conversation? You know, about maybe, legal strategy in the CAFO case? What would be the policy upshot of such a chat?

As an answer, here’s one scenario that we’ve seen many times before: The career legal staff tells the thin layer of political appointees at an agency that the plaintiffs have a strong case, and so it’s best to settle. That is, except for maybe a few face-saving tweaks, give the plaintiffs what they want. After all, the careerist could be saying to the politicals, if you choose to fight, it could get really messy, and, in the end, you’d likely still lose. So why not do it the easy way? Why not do it our way?

That’s the pitch that’s been heard a million times within the Deep State. And while it doesn’t always work, since it’s the path of least resistance, it’s a familiar course of action. And so we see how the Deep State so often wins.

So now the Deep State stands ready to welcome Scott Pruitt and the rest of the Trump contingent to their humble outpost at 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue. Well, okay, maybe “welcome” isn’t quite the right word.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15abb9930e5:6f5089:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Daily Mail reports: U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday invited Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to the White House, an Abbas spokesman said, after the two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since Trump took office.

‘President Trump has extended an official invitation to President Abbas to visit the White House soon to discuss ways to resume the political process, stressing his commitment to a peace process that will lead to a real peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis,’ said Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah.

Palestinians are concerned at the more favorable approach shown by Washington towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Trump came to power.

President Donald Trump has now been in office for 50 days, and his administration has moved swiftly to get America back on the right track.

Since taking office 20th January, Trump has signed 16 executive orders, met with an array of foreign leaders, delivered an unforgettable speech to congress, and made a meaningful impact on restoring the nation to prosperity. Here we look at what Trump has achieved in his first 50 days in office.

National Security

To stop the inflow of unvetted individuals from terrorist states that was taking place under Barack Obama’s refugee resettlement program, Trump signed an executive order suspending Obama’s refugee program and introducing a temporary travel ban from seven terror-prone countries. However, following multiple lawsuits, the U.S. Appeals Court upheld a ruling overturning the ban.

Our legal system is broken! &quot;77% of refugees allowed into U.S. since travel reprieve hail from seven suspect countries.&quot; (WT) SO DANGEROUS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2017

Since that ruling, Trump has signed a revised executive order that blocks the arrival of most travelers from six terror-prone countries for 90 days, and freezes the inflow of refugees from any country for the next 120 days. Iraq has now been dropped from the list of countries and green card holders remain exempt. However, four Democrat-led states are now reopening legal action against the latest order.

Immigration

Trump’s trademark project of building a wall along the Mexican border, which will prevent the flow of illegal immigration into America, is already taking shape. In his first week in office, Trump signed an executive order that seeks to “secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.”

Although construction of the wall has not yet begun, Trump has begun formulating plans for its construction, adding that the design phase is already in place. Trump’s Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), retired Marine General John Kelly, claimed that the wall will be built in under two years.

Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017

However, the greatest impact so far has come from the Trump administration’s guidance to Immigration Enforcement Agencies for stricter enforcement, directing them to hire thousands of new agents to apprehend illegal immigrants, and if necessary, send them back to their country of origin. Illegal border crossings have fallen by 40% in the months of January and February.

Jobs and the economy

Since his election in November, Trump has prioritized bringing jobs back to America, especially those from companies planning to outsource overseas. Having met with a range of business leaders, he has received assurances from companies such as Ford and Carrier Corporations to cancel their overseas plans and instead invest in America. Leading technology firms such as Apple, Amazon, Samsung, and Intel have also pledged to create thousands of new jobs in America over the coming years.

Reducing levels of regulation has also been a priority for the Trump administration. Following a year of record regulation, Trump has signed two executive orders attempting to slash regulation. His initial order stipulates that for every new regulation created, two other regulations must be cut. His second order will introduce “regulation watchdogs,” which will require federal agencies to dissolve their power as rule makers.

Trump has also promised significant tax breaks for both individuals and companies, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this week suggested the necessary reform might not be implemented until August.

Current economic trends are proving positive. This week, it emerged that hiring across America is at a three-year high. Amid rising economic confidence, the Dow Jones industrial average also broke record levels in January, reaching 20,000 points on its stock index.

Escalating war on the media

Since assuming the presidency, Trump has escalated his already hostile relationship with the mainstream media. Regularly referring to them as the “fake news media,” he has targeted networks such as ABC, NBC, and CNN for biased reporting, even describing them as the “enemy of the American people.”

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

These assertions are backed up by data, a recent analysis found that 88 per cent of mainstream media coverage is anti-Trump. Amid the rising tensions, Trump has confirmed he will not be attending this year’s White House Correspondent’s Dinner, becoming the first president to do so in 30 years.

Diplomacy

While in the Oval Office, Trump has met with a range of foreign leaders, such as UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

In all the meetings, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to close relations between America and the given country. In a meeting with Theresa May, Trump committed himself “100%” to NATO, while promising a “quick deal” on trade with Britain as it leaves the European Union. With Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump scrapped decades of U.S. policy urging a a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while Netanyahu argued there is “no greater supporter of the Jewish people” than Trump.

Meanwhile on meeting with Justin Trudeau, Trump promised “tweaking” of the current trade settlement between America and Canada, while Japanese Prime Minister said that future trade relations between American and Asia must be both “free and fair.”

Abortion and transgender bathrooms

Although not known to be overtly socially conservative, Trump has taken action to protect the rights of the unborn. In his first week, Trump signed an executive order restoring the Mexico City policy, which bans federal funds from being used to fund abortions at organizations such as Planned Parenthood.

Trump has also revoked Barack Obama’s federal guidelines forcing public institutions to let transgender people use the bathroom of their choice, even if it is not that of their biological sex. This decision will now be left up to the states and school districts.

President Donald Trump’s is looking to speed up the deportation of illegal immigrants by relocating some judges to detention centers.

In a letter from the Department of Justice (DOJ) obtained by Reuters, the Trump Administration is moving 50 judges to detention facilities in areas like Adelanto and San Diego, California, as well as Chicago, Illinois.

Additionally, the DOJ will ask immigration judges to hear cases from 6am to 6pm with two rotating shifts to hear more cases.

A source close to the DOJ told Reuters that judges will be able to volunteer for the some 50 deployments to detention centers, but if not enough signed on, judges would be assigned.

Last month, Breitbart Texas reported on a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo that requested the Trump administration allow federal immigration courts to use “expedited deportation proceedings” for any illegal immigrants living in the U.S. for two years or less. The process is currently limited to those only living in the U.S. for up to two weeks.

In his latest op-ed, New York Times columnist Timothy Egan explores the similarities between President Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon and King Henry VIII’s chief minister Thomas Cromwell, whom Bannon jokingly compared himself to when he told an interviewer last year, “I am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors.”

Egan writes that Bannon, like Cromwell, is a “brilliant and cunning” strategist who is “busy trying to destroy the existing order.” But Egan ominously warns Bannon to remember the fate of his “historical doppelgänger.” Cromwell was eventually executed for treason by the mercurial king he served.

From Egan’s New York Times column:

Bannon is a voracious reader — of philosophy, theory and the hinge moments in history. Cromwell, who altered the course of the Western world in ways still being felt today, was Steve Bannon in feathered Tudor finery.

…

Readers of Hilary Mantel’s revisionist novels, and viewers of the BBC series based on her work, know Thomas Cromwell as a brooding, brilliant master of the court of King Henry VIII, from 1532 to 1540. The real Cromwell was a cunning conspirator who tore up the old order in service of a self-indulgent, wife-killing king who forced a breakaway religion on his subjects.

Or was he serving his own needs, an overarching plan? That’s the question we should ask about Bannon. Like Cromwell, the Trump-whisperer in the West Wing is brilliant and cunning, and full of contradictions. He appears to be a self-hating baby boomer, a self-hating member of the Harvard Business School/Goldman Sachs elite, a self-hating Hollywood director and a self-hating journalist. From his films on Sarah Palin to his time running Breitbart, he learned how to be a very good propagandist. It’s a role that has served him well in the White House.

…

As chief strategist, he recently vowed a daily fight for “deconstruction of the administrative state.” This is a Cromwellian task aimed at overturning not just the traditional work of the federal government, but also the existing international order of treaties, trade pacts and alliances that has kept the world relatively safe since World War II. Trump’s cabinet is stocked with people whose goal is to neuter the agencies they head.

Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton joined SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily, where the conversation began with President Trump’s revised executive order on immigration and covered the Iran nuclear deal.

“I think the process it went through this time was obviously more careful, less hasty,” Bolton said of the order. “But honestly, I felt the first order, for all its flaws, was well within the president’s constitutional and statutory authority. I thought the Ninth Circuit decision that enjoined it on a nationwide basis was way, way out of line. It represented the court second-guessing what the president thought was a national security threat.”

“Throughout our history, courts have recognized they lack judicial competence in that area – unless you’re on the Ninth Circuit, in which case you’re fit to rule almost anything,” he said sarcastically.

Bolton thought President Trump “made adjustments to suit the nature of the litigation,” but dropping Iraq from the list of affected nations was not called for.

“Honestly, Iraq is no friend of the United States today,” he said. “It’s controlled, for all intents and purposes, by the Ayatollahs in Tehran. There are a lot of people in Iraq I would give asylum to in the United States, the famous case of interpreters and others who work with our military, absolutely; threatened Christian populations; and even some Sunni Muslims, who are the target of the Shia death squads that the Iranians have unleashed.”

“This shows why it’s a delicate balance that the Constitution gives to the political branches of government,” he observed. “There are a lot of other things we need to do to reduce the threat of terrorism. This executive order and its predecessor were never more than the first step.”

Kassam noted that the Treasury Department is “continuing to grant licenses to companies such as Boeing to pursue multi-billion-dollar deals with Iran” and asked if this was a practice Bolton would like to see changed.

“Absolutely,” Bolton replied. “This is one of the reasons why I have said for quite some time – really since the Iran nuclear deal was signed in the summer of 2015 – that the next Republican administration should abrogate the deal immediately or at least now that we’re 50 days into the administration, as soon as possible.”

“The longer it goes on with the consequences of the sanctions lifting and the rest of it, the stronger the ayatollahs grow and the more its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs can proceed essentially unimpeded,” he argued. “This is what happens in a transition when the new government doesn’t take power, because the bureaucracy continues on, as if it’s on autopilot. That’s what this licensing issue represents.”

Bolton said that “the personnel problem across the government is very real, and it stems in part from the slowness of the Senate in confirming the president’s nominees.”

“Until you get the top positions filled, it’s customary not to nominate subordinate positions in those respective departments,” he explained.

“But I’d say also this is important: you can’t come into the government with no philosophy and expect to understand immediately the direction you need to take on key issues like the Iran nuclear deal,” he continued. “If you don’t have a philosophy, if you don’t have a view, the risk is extraordinarily high that the bureaucracies at the State Department, the CIA, the Defense Department will co-opt the new secretary, the new head of the agency. The bureaucracy’s policies will become their policy, and then if the White House doesn’t resist, they’ll become the administration’s policy.”

“I don’t think that’s why people elected Donald Trump, honestly, and that’s why it’s so important to get a grip on the bureaucracy,” he urged. “It was often said, dating back to the Reagan administration, that personnel is policy.”

Bolton said it was not groundless paranoia to worry about the disruptive influence of Obama holdovers on the Trump administration, although he thought the notion of a “shadow government” or “deep state” was excessively conspiratorial.

“I think there’s certainly some element of Obama administration political appointees who have ‘burrowed in,’ as the saying goes, to the bureaucracy. But I personally do not believe there is a ‘deep state.’ I don’t think there is a cabal or a conspiracy,” he said.

“I think what you’re facing is a culture: a bureaucratic culture, let’s say, at the State Department – I wrote about this in my book after I left the government in the Bush administration – that has existed for decades, that is fundamentally divergent from a conservative or Republican foreign policy perspective. It’s a bureaucracy that’s absolutely expert at capturing and co-opting new political appointees who aren’t paying attention,” he contended.

“There’s a human element here, too,” Bolton added. “If you are a bureaucrat, and for eight years under Obama you’ve been doing a certain thing, you don’t get up every morning hating what you’re doing. You would have resigned, found another assignment, gone somewhere else. So for eight years, you’ve been doing this. In come the new guys and say, ‘Well, we’re not going to do that.’ In effect, a lot of people take that to be a criticism of what they’ve been doing for eight years. It is a criticism of the policy. It’s not a criticism of them, but that’s how they react. It’s instinctive. There aren’t memos. There aren’t meetings. It’s a cultural issue.”

Kassam concluded the interview by asking Bolton for his take on the political dynamics within the Republican Party as Obamacare repeal is debated.

“I have to say, I’m astounded that we’re at this point. We’ve been saying since Obamacare was adopted that the Republican position was to repeal it and replace it, and now we find that we don’t know what the replacement is. How can this be, after all these years?” Bolton exclaimed.

“The notion that somehow, we have to accommodate people who have been brought into the subsidy system by Obamacare, and we can’t do what we should be doing, which is reducing individual dependence on government subsidies – when did that become a Republican principle?” he asked.

Bolton said he was “utterly confused and dismayed that we’re in such disarray.”

His dismay was not much alleviated by Republican attempts to explain their repeal plan with PowerPoint presentations. “As soon as somebody turns their PowerPoint on, I turn off,” he sighed.

John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

The influx of unregulated waves of illegal immigrants poses a “huge security threat to Europe,” according to Hungary’s Foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó.

In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Minister Szijjártó said that Europe must come to grips with its immigration crisis before it is too late, a task that demands recognizing the problem for what it is, rather than resorting to euphemisms and hiding behind political correctness.

“Illegal immigration poses a huge security threat to Europe. It is obvious that an unregulated and uncontrolled massive influx of migrants will allow terrorist organizations to take advantage of it by sending in fighters and terrorists among the migrants” he said.

“If you don’t know who you allow to enter,” he added, “no one can guarantee that all of them are coming with good will. Of course, not all migrants are terrorists but it is clear that there is an opportunity for terrorist organizations to take advantage of this uncontrolled and unregulated massive influx of people.”

Szijjártó told Breitbart News that a big part of the problem is the “hypocrisy and political correctness” that keep people from identifying the problem for what it is and from using precise language when describing the issues.

“We had to fight for months just to be able to speak of ‘migration.’ Because it was considered a ‘refugee crisis,’ despite the fact that it has nothing to do with a refugee crisis. It is a massive influx of illegal migrants from other parts of the world into Europe.”

“But we had to fight for months just to be able to say that and not be badgered for using an expression of the sort,” he said.

Breitbart News recently reported on efforts by an Italian lobby group funded by George Soros to purge journalistic language of all references to migrants that could carry a negative connotation, including the term “illegal immigrants.”

The list of forbidden terms to be expunged from news reporting comprises expressions that underscore the ethnicity of certain migrant groups or their illegal status. Terms like “clandestini” (clandestine migrants), “zingari” (gypsies), “nomadi” (nomads), “extracomunitari” (those coming from outside the European Union) and other similar terms have been marked for exclusion from news reports.

Even precise terms like “Albanian,” “Maghrebi” and “Chinese” should be removed from news reports, the association contends, because “today, they are no longer neutral.”

Even “Islamic extremists” should simply be referred to as “extremists,” the guide declares, to avoid stirring up prejudice against Muslims.

In his interview this week, Szijjártó told Breitbart News that “honesty and straightforward speech are critical for Europe to be able to move forward, leaving hypocrisy and political correctness behind.”

Even regarding the putative “right to migrate” itself, Szijjártó said that greater clarity is needed.

“When it comes to international law, which we think should be a stable basis to judge this whole issue,” he said, “the right to a safe life is clearly a fundamental human right. That’s why we push for assisting countries around war-torn areas like Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and others, in order to be able to take care of refugees coming from war-torn areas closer to their homes.”

“On the other hand,” he said, “picking a country where you would like to live and violating borders in order to get there is not a fundamental human right.”

“So our approach is to bring help where it is needed and but not to import problems where there are no problems yet,” he said.

Szijjártó said that Hungary has reacted positively to the foreign policy of U.S. President Donald Trump, who seems to understand what other leaders do not.

“We totally understand when Donald Trump speaks about renewing American security. We also understand why Donald Trump says ‘America first,’ because we do the same thing in Hungary. Our number-one policy priority is to ensure the security of the Hungarian people,” he said.

“This is why we don’t let anyone enter our country illegally,” he said, “regardless of what the international media write about us or what other politicians think.”

“Our job is not to please the media. Our job is to satisfy the expectations of the Hungarian people, because they gave us the mandate and not the New York Times or Le Figaro, he said.

When you’re President of the United States, you can pretty much meet with whoever you want, whenever you want, whether that person is “on the schedule” or not.

Such an unplanned, off-the-schedule meeting took place last Wednesday at the White House, where President Donald Trump sat down with TMZ President Harvey Levin, according to the New York Times. Levin and Trump have a history together, partly based around Trump’s appearance on Levin’s Fox News special “Objectified.”

The success of that show has now led to a spinoff series, also called “Objectified.” Levin spoke with Trump about appearing again on an episode of that series, which starts in September. However, he also asked the Commander-in-Chief to help in securing an interview with the most famous man not named Donald Trump to ever own a “MAGA” hat.

That of course being Tom Brady. According to the New York Times, “One of Mr. Levin’s ideal guests is Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback and a friend of Mr. Trump, and Mr. Levin planned to ask the president if he would help secure the athlete’s participation, according to one of the people who described the visit.”

An off-the-record meeting with the leader of the free world, a probable second feature with POTUS on your TV show, then leveraging that visit to secure a better than average shot at getting an interview with greatest quarterback of all time?

Not a bad way to spend a Wednesday afternoon.

Hannity described them as saboteurs and warned they were”hell-bent” on destroying Trump’s presidency.

Transcript as follows:

[F]or weeks, we’ve been warning you about the deep state Obama holdover government bureaucrats who are hell-bent on destroying this president, President Trump. Tonight, it’s time for the Trump administration to begin to purge these saboteurs before it’s too late. That’s tonight’s “Opening Monologue.”

Let’s go back to 1861. President Abraham Lincoln — he created, you know, a team of rivals, a so-called team of rivals, a cabinet of rivals, including adversaries that he ran against in the Republican primary. But while president Lincoln sought to unify his party through cabinet selections, he also executed an extensive government purge. He fired over 75 percent, nearly 1,200 people out of 1,500 bureaucrats that worked in the executive branch who President Lincoln feared could be disloyal.

It’s time now for President Trump to follow Abraham Lincoln’s example and a fire anyone and everyone who is actively working against him in government. After all, even former president Bill Clinton — he utilized this tactic back in 1993. He fired all 93 U.S. attorneys — all of them. Now, according to Conservative Review’s Daniel Horowitz, sacking opposing government employees is best utilized at the start of an administration.

He writes, quote, “Clinton easily fired all 93 U.S. attorneys on day one. Nobody blinked an eye. Yet when Bush’s attorney general fired eight U.S. attorneys well into his second term, well, that became a national scandal.”

So it’s very important for President Trump to act right now and not just avoid outrage from the left — that’s not what this is about — because he’s got to end the leaks that are plaguing this administration. Major leaks, like the ones you see right there on your screen, started just five days after President Trump was sworn into office.

Now, the explosion of these leaks coincides with a New York Times report that says in his final weeks in office, President Obama revised executive order 12333 which allows the widespread sharing of this raw data collected by American intelligence agencies across 17 government agencies.

Now, that is an additional 16 agencies and their employees who in the final two weeks when Obama was in office, who gained access to top-secret intelligence that they never had access to before.

Now, we’ve been asking for weeks on this program, why did President Obama wait until the last minute to do this? And why didn’t he apply this to himself for eight years?</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab9a889a9:4339d2:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Sen. Chuck Schumer tweeted the fake news that Planned Parenthood offers women “mammograms, maternity care, cancer screenings &amp; more.”

The Senate minority leader observed the GOP Obamacare repeal measure – which he calls Trumpcare – would cut Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding. However, he takes up the false claims that the abortion business provides mammograms and maternity care and, therefore, should continue to be funded by the federal government.

“To try to justify $500 million a year in taxpayer funding for the nation’s biggest abortion chain, Sen. Schumer continues to parrot Planned Parenthood’s false talking points that it provides mammograms and ‘maternity care,’” says Lila Rose, president of national pro-life group Live Action, in response to Schumer’s tweet.

“The reality is, Planned Parenthood does zero mammograms, performs less than two percent of women’s cancer screenings in the U.S., offers virtually no prenatal care, yet does over a third of the nation’s abortions – 887 abortions every day,” Rose adds.

In 2015, during testimony before Congress, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said, “[W]e do not have mammogram machines at our health centers. And we’ve never stated that we did.”

However, Live Action produced a fact-checking video demonstrating that Richards and even former President Barack Obama made the false claims that the abortion business provides mammograms:

The pro-life group also recently released another investigative video in which Planned Parenthood staff members throughout the country are repeatedly heard informing the investigator that their clinics do not offer “prenatal care.” However, the abortion chain’s officials, including Richards, have touted its prenatal care services.

“Live Action’s recent investigation has shown that women wanting to keep their children who were seeking prenatal care at Planned Parenthoods across the country were consistently turned away, despite Planned Parenthood’s claims that its federal funding goes toward prenatal care,” Rose says. “When subsequently asked, the abortion chain has refused to tell the media how many of its centers actually provide prenatal care.”

“Clearly, Sen. Schumer, it’s time to redirect those federal funds to local health care providers that actually do mammograms, offer prenatal care, and provide more comprehensive health services to women,” Rose asserts.

This week President Donald Trump informed Planned Parenthood it would have to quit performing abortions in order to keep its federal funding for its “other” services. However, Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) rejected Trump’s proposal.

The provision to end Planned Parenthood’s federal funding would redirect it to other federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) that provide more health services, but do not perform abortions.

Nationally, there are 13,000 FQHCs – a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities by 20 to 1.

A recent Marist poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 40 percent of those who say they are “pro-choice,” and 41 percent of Democrats.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab9a889a9:4339d1:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

After a series of blackouts in South Australia, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has offered to solved the state’s energy problems with his innovative battery system in short order, or the system will be free.

Musk made the promise after Tesla executive Lyndon Rive claimed the company could install 100-300 megawatt hours of battery storage in just 100 days.

@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 10, 2017

Tesla has both commercial and consumer versions of its innovative energy system that uses solar power to charge large batteries.

The Tesla battery system is already in place in places like the Hawaiian island of Kauai, CNBC reports:

[T]he Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) is now drawing energy from 272 Tesla power packs to provide electricity after dark. While the island previously relied on solar and other renewable energy during the day, it had no way to store the sun’s power after it went down. Using stored energy from Tesla’s power packs is expected to save KIUC 1.6 million gallons of diesel fuel annually, which has traditionally been the way the utility generates power after dark. However, some investors still aren’t convinced that Telsa’s energy venture is a winner, as CNBC continues: “At this time, we ascribe zero value to Tesla shares from this business,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas told investors. “We take this view due to the uncertain economic and regulatory forces facing the energy business, particularly the solar business.”

Billionaire Musk, although not a Trump supporter during the election, has become a frequent presence in the new administration, visiting the White House this past week for a meeting on infrastructure. It’s his third visit since President Trump took office on Jan. 20.

Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is reportedly considering a run for U.S. Senate in 2018, when incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is said to be considering retirement.

Several media outlets report that Schwarzenegger, who recently raised his profile with a series of Twitter clashes with President Donald Trump, is thinking of re-entering the political fray after several years’ absence.

Politico’s Carla Marinucci reports: “The prospect of Schwarzenegger’s return to elected politics in a 2018 U.S. Senate run — possibly as an independent — is generating increasing buzz in state Republican circles, fueled by the former governor’s seeming ability to get under the skin of President Donald Trump on social media.”

Schwarzenegger also opposed Trump in the Republican presidential primary, backing Ohio governor John Kasich instead.

If elected, Schwarzenegger could pose a significant opposition threat to the Trump administration on issues such as climate change. California’s controversial cap-and-trade system was introduced under Schwarzenegger’s administration.

However, Schwarzenegger will have to confront his own political record along the way. Though he was re-elected to a second term in 2006, Schwarzenegger is mostly remembered for leaving the state in a fiscal mess after abandoning the reform agenda that brought him to office in the first place.

The East Bay Times recalls:

The Republican governor’s approval ratings fluctuated while he was in office and were as high as 63 percent in March 2007. But five months after he left office, a Field Poll found that three of four California voters surveyed had a negative image of Schwarzenegger in the wake of revelations he had fathered a boy with a former household staff member while married to TV journalist Maria Shriver.

Whether he runs as an independent or as a Republican, Schwarzenegger would face stiff competition from a long line of California Democrats who have been waiting, patiently, to angle for Feinstein’s seat.

Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), an outspoken critic of the House Republican replacement for Obamacare, joined SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily. Paul revealed he has been in constant contact with President Donald Trump about the issue, including a phone call Thursday night, and said the president is “very open to negotiation.”

Kassam asked if House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was correct to argue that repealing Obamacare without an immediate comprehensive replacement plan is impossible, and the plan his caucus has put on the table is the closest to repeal they can get.

“I’ve always been for repeal and replace at the same time, but not necessarily in the same bill,” Senator Paul replied. “The reason why I think you need ‘replace’ is we need to offer hope, and we need to offer an insurance product that is inexpensive, and something that will fix the marketplace so everybody can get access to health insurance.”

“The problem with putting replace and repeal in one bill is that we all tend to agree on the repeal aspect, Republicans, but we tend to disagree on the replacement aspect,” he said. “My idea of replacement is trying to let the marketplace work, encouraging people to join co-ops and healthcare associations so they can drive prices down, and freeing-up the sale of all kinds of insurance.”

“Some of those things we actually agree with Paul Ryan on. The problem is Paul Ryan has a lot of Obamacare Lite stuff that he wants to keep in there,” Paul said. “He wants to keep the Obamacare subsidies. He calls them tax credits, refundable tax credits. He wants to keep the Obamacare taxes, all of the taxes, for a year – and then he wants to keep the Cadillac tax, the tax on good insurance, forever.”

“He also has an individual mandate in there, which is curious, because if you’ve listened to the debate for the last six, seven years, one of the things Republicans have hated the worst is the individual mandate,” Paul added. “He keeps the individual mandate. You just don’t pay the government; you have to pay the insurance company. I think if you talk to customers and patients across the country and talk to doctors, there’s not a great deal of difference in dislike between the government and the insurance companies. You’re not going to make a lot of us happy if we have to pay the insurance company a penalty instead of the government.”

“But there’s also insurance company bailouts in there. This gets to the fundamental heart of the problem. The problem with Obamacare is they tell people, ‘You know what? You can wait to buy insurance until after you’re sick.’ When they do that, nobody buys insurance until they’re sick, and the price of the insurance goes up. Ryancare doesn’t fix that. If you do not fix that, the premiums will continue to skyrocket, but we’re going to be blamed for it,” the senator warned his fellow Republicans.

“After repeal is voted on, and even if it’s an incomplete repeal or Obamacare Lite, Republicans will own this. So we’ve got to get it right before we do this. We have to understand fundamentally that if you wait to let people buy insurance until after they’re sick, they will,” he said.

“The interesting thing about the individual mandate in the Ryan plan is that let’s say you do lose your job, or let’s say you can’t buy insurance for a while. Now you know that when you buy it again, you have a 30 percent penalty. You don’t get the penalty until you buy it. So why would you buy it? You’re going to wait to buy it until you get sick. So once again, as the adverse selection gets worse, the death spiral of Obamacare continues after Ryancare,” Paul argued.

Kassam noted that the White House is making a push for the House bill on Paul’s home turf in Kentucky and asked if the situation had devolved into “all-out war” between Senator Paul and the executive branch.

“Actually, I think the president is very open to negotiation,” Paul replied. “I talked to him again last night by phone. I’ve talked to him twice a week, which is quite a bit for anybody to talk to the president that’s not in the administration.”

“I talked to him again last night. He said he’s open to negotiation, but I reiterated to him that Paul Ryan went on TV for 45 minutes yesterday with a press conference, and he said, ‘The response to this, the choices are binary.’ Well, binary means there are two choices: either we take it or leave it. Either we take Obamacare Lite or we get nothing. That isn’t sitting well with conservatives, and I promise you, the more we hear Paul Ryan say, ‘Take it or leave it,’ the less we’re willing to take it,” he said.

“Also, we are concerned that if we vote for Obamacare Lite, and insurance premiums still continue to go through the roof, and a year from now, insurance companies are going bankrupt the same way they’re going bankrupt now, people will say, ‘What did you guys do? You had six years to figure this out, and you couldn’t get it right,’” Paul said.

When Kassam asked if opponents of the Ryan bill had the votes to keep it from passing, Paul replied, “The proof’s in the pudding.”

“There are 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus. They will make their decision. So far, their leadership and their voting has been that they’re for clean repeal. I believe they voted 80 percent to take a position of clean repeal. And that’s my position: separate repeal from replace,” he said.

“You do replace. I do replace it on the same day. We’re not completely unable to vote on more than one thing in a day,” he pointed out.

“We should put the repeal forward that we voted on a year ago, and that passed unanimously. Put it on, and the same day, let’s put up replacement,” Paul recommended. “Now, what House leadership will tell you is, you probably won’t get to 60 votes. I can’t guarantee 60 votes. All I can guarantee is what we’re for. We should put it forward, and if Democrats block replacement, they still own the whole thing.”

Paul agreed with Kassam that many Republicans do not seem to understand they hold the high ground on Obamacare repeal and could make Democrats pay a political price for interfering with vitally needed measures to deal with the failing program.

“I don’t think they understand that yet. I’m still trying to get that through to them,” said Paul. “I am for replacement. I do want to pass replacement – but if they don’t, instead of Republicans fighting with each other, why don’t we make sure that the Democrats still are responsible? If they choose to block replacement, they’re still responsible.”

“I think we could pass replacement, though. I think there actually are some Democrats who will come around,” he predicted. “Some of these ideas are really reasonable. For example, what if we put up the individual idea that every patient in America should be allowed to join a healthcare association? We expand healthcare associations in one vote. That’s a tough vote for Democrats to say they’re against the consumer to join a buying group to get a lower price and to get guaranteed issue.”

“This is the other thing nobody understands,” he elaborated. “They think you have to mandate guaranteed issue – you know, that you can buy insurance after you’re sick by law. The other way you do it is you let people get group insurance. You join a co-op, you join the health buying group, and when you buy it, you have group insurance. Group insurance is protected, and if you get group insurance, you will not be let go. Your prices will not go up.”

Paul predicted such a reform would “completely transform” the doctor-patient-insurance company relationship.

“Let’s say you’re part of a million-person buying group. Now you have enormous leverage, so instead of us kissing the boots of the insurance executives, it’ll be the opposite. The insurance executives will be begging to talk to our person, whoever’s in charge of this,” he said. “And I promise you, whether you make $30,000 or you make $100,000 in our country, people don’t like the way they’re being treated by the health insurance companies.”

He said that under Ryancare, insurance companies would “continue to lose money, but Ryan’s going to give them a backstop, a bailout.”

“The chronic insurance company bailout that was in Obamacare is still in this new Obamacare Lite bill,” Paul said.

He also expressed strong support for tort reform as part of a plan to bring medical costs down.

“I’m a physician,” he reminded the audience. “We’ve got to try to stop the frivolous lawsuits, not only for the expense of them, but everybody orders about a million too many test, because they’re afraid of being sued. We need to fix that.”

“Unfortunately – or fortunately, depending on how you look at it – that probably has to be done at the state capitols, because people get sued at the state courts, and the state courts are under the purview of state law,” he added. “Some states have fixed this, frankly, or made it a lot better. They have review panels. They have caps on damages. I don’t know if any have loser-pays, but I like the loser-pays aspect also.”

If passed in its current form, the GOP’s Obamacare 2.0 bill will impose brutal costs Americans still struggling to make it through a great recession—particularly President Donald Trump’s base—and risk handing Congress and the presidency back to Democrats.

1) The bill’s provisions increase healthcare costs for Trump voters in critical states. As an analysis conducted by the Washington Post shows, voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin will see their tax credits decrease under Obamacare 2.0. “If you’re a 40-year-old making $75,000 a year, you’re going to get a 75 percent or higher increase to your tax credits—a beneficial situation for you,” the Post explains. “If, however, you’re a 60-year-old making $30,000 a year, you’re going to see a reduction in those tax credits (unless you live in Upstate New York or Massachusetts or parts of central Texas).”

In other words, senior citizens—who vote regularly in mid-term elections—will see their healthcare costs increase under the Republicans’ bill.

Plus, Obamacare 2.0 phases out credits for people who start earning more than $75,000. Why? Because screw the voters and they’re on their own? What a great message to send to the middle class! Not only are Republicans hurting people struggling to make ends meet, they also punish you if you make too much money. Everyone loses, except perhaps insurance companies.

2) Meanwhile, the bill is “a gift to illegal aliens,” as conservative author Daniel Horowitz writes. Illegals can get health care through identity theft and fraud, because Obamacare 2.0 makes it impossible to check enrollees’ immigration status. The bill incentivizes further illegal immigration by encouraging illegals to come to the U.S. to cut into taxpayer-funded programs meant for citizens. Poll after poll shows Trump’s immigration policies prioritizing Americans and their problems over foreigners and their wants are hugely popular with voters. Giving away health care to illegals, while ramping up the price for Trump’s core voters, is a slap in the face.

3) Obamacare 2.0 will be labeled as “Trumpcare,” and Democrats and their media allies will highlight every hard case to attack Republicans for hurting the poor and elderly. Remember when a progressive group put out an ad showing Paul Ryan pushing a grandma in a wheelchair off a cliff? Obamacare 2.0 gives the media and the Democrats a golden opportunity to walk away from their healthcare mess and blame Republicans, and amplify that message endlessly.

4) Republicans kicked things off with horrific messaging. In a condescending statement, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz told Americans they’ll have to “invest” in their health care instead of getting a new iPhone. “Americans have choices,” he said on CNN. “And they’ve got to make a choice. And so, maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on, maybe they should invest it in their own health care. They’ve got to make those decisions for themselves.”

Being forced to buy a product that doesn’t deliver adequate care and keeps increasing in price year after year isn’t an “investment,” for one. Left-wingers pointed out that Chaffetz was mocking poor people who get blindsided by a health crisis: “If low-income families make the wrong series of choices, forcing them to choose between their health and their finances, that’s on them. How’s that for a winning message?” The Huffington Post immediately splashed a photo of Chaffetz pointing his finger at the viewer:

Chaffetz later walked back his comments, but the damage was done. They sound especially bad in light of Obamacare 2.0’s “continuous coverage” provision.

5) The arbitrary and crushing penalty for not enrolling during the randomly-selected period will hurt financially struggling voters already fighting to stay afloat. As Avik Roy writes in Forbes, the “continuous coverage” part inflicts a massive cost increase on those who go without paying for a plan for more than 63 days. “Worse still, the bill contains an arbitrary ‘continuous coverage’ provision, in which those who sign up for coverage outside of the normal open enrollment period would pay a 30 percent surcharge to the normal insurance premium,” Roy writes. And you have to pay this for an entire year—which will not go over well with people struggling to pay for rent, for childcare, for student loans. In other words, it’s not enough to pay a one-time penalty if you forget to sign up for your Obamacare 2.0 in time or choose to forgo insurance altogether. No, you have to pay 30 percent more, on top of rising costs, for a whole year. How is this supposed to help, say, parents with three kids paying a large monthly premium (not counting eye and dental, of course) with a high deductible?

6) This bill is going to unleash the kind of political fury on Republicans that will elect Elizabeth Warren in 2020. Part of what killed Hillary Clinton’s campaign was voters getting their massive Obamacare premium increases in the mail in October. Republicans seem eager to inflict that kind of fatal damage on themselves. The explosive reaction to Obamacare launched the Tea Party in 2010 and swept Republicans into Congress during the mid-term elections of 2014. The Left is furious and energetic under Trump. The 2018 midterm elections are right around the corner, and Democrats are going to launch a holy war against Trump during the 2020 election. The Left will rally around Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other progressives and portray the Democrats as the party of the forgotten man. The white, working class gave Trump a chance in 2016. They could easily begin voting Democratic again or drop out of the political process altogether after a healthcare betrayal.

7) It destroys political capital desperately needed for the rest of Trump’s first term, particularly pro-American immigration reform. Trump’s election victory wasn’t a once-in-a-generation election. It was once-in-a-century, or once-in-history. Republicans have one, brief chance to correct the course the U.S. is heading down and bind up all of the wounds inflicted on Americans over the decades. There is a small window to end the era of cheap labor, low wages, mass immigration, hollowed-out communities, family disintegration, drug addiction, and suicide. Will Republicans take it and secure their party’s dominance for the next 50 years? Or will they throw it away?

Sixty percent of adults are “hopeful and optimistic” about America’s future. That’s a precious opportunity, one that shouldn’t be wasted. “The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f—ed over. If we deliver, we’ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we’ll govern for 50 years,” White House Chief strategist Steve Bannon said during a November interview. “That’s what the Democrats missed… They lost sight of what the world is about.”

Will Trump continue to support Obamacare 2.0 despite conservative and populist dissent?

Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz subpoenaed two agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to appear before his committee in connection with the Obama Administration’s gun-running program, Fast and Furious. Firearms from the former president’s scheme were allegedly involved in the 2011 murder of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agent Jaime Zapata in Mexico.

Chaffetz, who serves as chairman of the House Oversight Committee issued the subpoenas after the two ATF agents failed to appear voluntarily before the committee.

“I’m tired of hearing from just [Justice Department] management, I want to hear from the people that actually are on the front lines doing this,” Chaffetz told Fox News.

Chaffetz wants to hear directly from ATF Agent William Temple, special agent in charge of the Dallas Field Division, and Associate Director Ronald Turk. The hearing marks the first effort by Congress to re-open the investigation into President Obama’s Fast and Furious gun trafficking scheme since he left office in January. ICE Agent Zapata was killed by one of the guns involved in this program, and Special Agent Victor Avila was injured during the attack in Mexico.

Following the attack on the two ICE agents, Breitbart News reported:

Agent Zapata’s partner Victor Avila spoke out about the attack that left Agent Zapata dead and him wounded. His twin sister Magdalena Avila-Villalobos spoke for him in the Univision special on Fast and Furious. Avila is so scared and hurt by the attack he did not speak out until he knew he was in a secure location. No one knows for sure why Agent Zapata and Agent Avila, assigned to the US Embassy, were asked to travel on road 57, a road controlled by the Zeta Cartel and extremely dangerous. They didn’t even know why they were given the mission to retrieve electronic surveillance equipment. The urgency made it even more suspicious. Agent Zapata and Agent Avila met with American consulate agents in Monterrey and received 14 boxes of equipment. They did stop for something to eat on road 57 before heading back to Mexico City. About a half hour after leaving the restaurant they noticed two cars closely following them. Within seconds the vehicles surrounded them and 14 heavily armed men formed a circle around their car. Unfortunately, Agent Zapata put the car in park, which forced the doors to automatically open. Agent Avila said they thought their diplomatic plates would protect them and the screamed they were American agents. The men didn’t care and demanded them to exit the vehicle. The agents refused to leave their vehicle. They frantically tried to relock the doors, but instead Agent Avila accidentally lowered his window. A rifle and handgun came in through the small opening and the man opened fire. Agent Avila pressed the emergency satellite button, but it did not work. He also tried to place an emergency call to the embassy, the Mexican capital, and the First Post of the Regional Security Command. They told Avila a Mexican Federal Police helicopter would be there in 40 minutes. 90 bullets were fired. Five hit Agent Zapata and three hit Agent Avila in his right leg. Agent Zapata turned to Agent Avila and said, “I am going to die.” Agent Avila responded, “No, you are not going to die. Be strong, help is on the way, you are not going to die. While in the rescue helicopter Agent Avila was informed Agent Zapata did, in fact, die.

On Thursday, the two ATF officials failed to appear before the committee looking into the assault on the agents. ATF Acting-Director Thomas Brandon, an Obama Administration holdover appointed in 2015, claims he did not order the two ATF officials to skip the hearing Fox News reported. However, he said he agreed with their decision to bypass the Oversight Committee’s hearing.

The failure of the two ATF officials to voluntarily appear before Congress sparked the issuance of a subpoena and sharp rebukes from both sides of the aisle.

“That puts us in a kind of awkward position. We got the boss, ‘OK guys, you don’t have to show up.’ And that sends a hell of a message. That’s a problem,” Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said.

Chaffetz complained that the ATF “continues to insist” that his committee should not speak directly with the two officials.

Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas John Craft also failed to appear. Chaffetz said his committee issued the invitation to Craft late and he would not be issuing a subpoena for him at this time.

Fox News reported on an ATF Inspector General report that was completed in 2012 but not released until March 1, 2016. Fox reported:

The IG said the ATF were aware in 2010 that Osorio and his brother might be trafficking firearms to Mexico, but they did not follow up or further investigate until after Zapata’s death. Otilio Osorio and Riendfliesh were arrested in late February 2011 after the ATF confirmed weapons used in Zapata’s murder had been purchased by them. The report faulted ATF for its handling of the case, saying there was “probable cause” to arrest Osorio and his brother “after ATF witnessed the Osorios complete a transfer of 40 firearms on November 9, 2010.” The IG said: “Overall, we found numerous problems with ATF’s assimilation of information concerning [the suspects] … and the timeliness of ATF’s response to mounting evidence that they were committing firearms offenses.”

The report states that two weapons used in the murder of Agent Zapata and wounding of Agent Avila traced back to a Dallas-area gun show purchase by Otilio Osorio, and a purchase by Robert Riendfliesh at a gun store in Beaumont, Texas. The report continues, stating the ATF suspected the two men were trafficking firearms to Mexico but failed to further investigate the purchases until after the murder of Agent Zapata. ATF agents eventually arrested the two men in connection with the purchases.

Despite the length of time since the incident, the creation of the report, and its issuance, Director Brandon told Chaffetz he was not prepared for the hearing. “That’s a bunch of crap,” Chaffetz snapped at the ATF acting director. Chaffetz responded that he received a draft of the report in December.

Murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry

The murder of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010 is also connected to the Fast and Furious gun-running scheme. Two guns involved in Fast and Furious were found at the scene of his murder. Terry and other members of his elite Border Patrol BORSTAR team engaged a group of Mexican bandits. The bandits opened fire. Terry was shot in the back and died before reaching the hospital.

The Terry family met with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump several times during the campaign. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas, the Terry family expressed hope that President Trump would get to the answers their family has been searching for over the past six years.

“I want people to grow a conscious and come clean as to what transpired, what was covered up and what the hell were they thinking,” Terry’s sister, Kelly Terry-Willis told Breitbart Texas.

She said she had heard many promises by many people. “If Mr. Trump can get those skeletons out and expose the truth then my family can finally get closure and justice for Brian,” Kelly explained. “I think there are a lot of people scared that just might happen. It may take time, and we will be patient, but the truth always reveals itself. I hope Trump can make that happen.”

On Friday, Terry’s brother, Kent Terry, spoke out about the new hearing and the subpoena issued to the two ATF officials.

“We have the House, Senate, and the White House now,” Kent Terry said. “There should be absolutely no reason we should fail to get the answers and accountability for the deaths of Agent Zapata and my brother. Their mothers have been put through Hell since these murders occurred. They deserve to know why their sons, who served every day, were killed by criminals armed by our government.”

“Enough time has gone by,” an exasperated Kent Terry explained. “I respect their hands were tied with the Obama Administration’s executive privilege taken on the Fast and Furious documents. But why hasn’t the Oversight Committee gone after the ATF agent who no longer works there? Why hasn’t the committee asked why who has been fired in connection with the program?”

The full report on the hearing held by the committee on March 9 is available on the Oversight Committee’s website. The committee is expected to hear from the two ATF officials under subpoena later this month.

During his regular segment on the national John Batchelor Show, Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief Aaron Klein blamed the news media for “fueling” an “atmosphere” of anti-Semitism in the U.S. by repeatedly propagating a false narrative that President Trump and top administration officials are anti-Semitic.

Klein contended that the constant stream of news stories attempting to link the White House to anti-Semitism may have created a dangerous environment in which “you have some (anti-Semitic) nut jobs come out of the woodwork” and target Jews in the U.S.

Klein further said the news media was largely silent about the potential for an anti-Semitic resurgence when the Obama administration allowed the passage of an anti-Israel United Nations Security Council resolution declaring Israeli communities in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem to be illegal. The move, Klein argued, “puts the anti-Semitic BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) campaign on the steroids.”

Click below to listen:

Klein was asked by Batchelor to comment on the reported spate of recent domestic anti-Semitic acts and threats. Klein responded that there is one “entity that needs to be blamed here in part. And I am talking here about the media.”

He continued:

We don’t know yet who is behind some of the threats. One of them turned out to be a fake news reporter who resigned in disgrace… Clearly we are seeing something. And so, the question is who is behind it? We don’t know. Is it overseas? Is it domestic?

But what I can say is that I believe personally as a reporter – especially one based in Israel and one who has been involved for 11, 12 years reporting on the threats of anti-Semitism – to me I believe that the news media has reached a height of total irresponsibility. Because what they have been doing since Donald Trump has been elected and even before that is spewing this completely fake news narrative. That Donald Trump is almost Hitlerian. That his top advisors – and I know them very well, they are fighters of anti-Semitism – that somehow, they are anti-Semitic.

So, they have built this false narrative in America. And I believe that when you have major stories in major news outlets and major networks actually having segments, I’ve seen many of them, debating whether Trump or whether his top advisors – some of them the closest friends that Israel has ever had in the White House – whether they are anti-Semitic. This…creates an atmosphere of alleged anti-Semitism. And maybe you have some nut jobs come out of the woodwork…”

Klein raised questions about the news media’s intentions:

But to me also I don’t understand where the news media was before Donald Trump. Where they were reporting on the rise of anti-Semitism alongside the BDS movement? Or what about reporting on the possibility for anti-Semitic acts or anti-Israel acts after President Obama pushed through the United Nations resolution against the so-called settlements? Meaning Jewish communities in the West Bank… eastern Jerusalem. Which now delegitimizes those communities. Which delegitimizes Israel and sends a message. Puts the anti-Semitic BDS campaign on steroids. So, I am singling out the media for fueling some of this atmosphere that is now allowing some of these atrocities.

On his own radio program on last Sunday, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” Klein also accused the news media of “hypocrisy” for minimizing Obama’s longtime alleged anti-Semitic ties, including to his controversial pastor of nearly twenty years, Jeremiah Wright Jr.

Referring to Obama, Klein stated, “This is a president who signs a deal with Iran, which wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth and is an anti-Semitic, terror-supporting entity. And now the media is generating this fake news story with Trump, the greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House?”

Last week of a former Intercept reporter was arrested for allegedly calling in at least eight phone threats against Jewish institutions, including Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) and a bomb threat to the Anti-Defamation League. The reporter, Juan Thompson, was fired from the online publication for fabricating sections of stories.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab93a544e:39c9ea:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Thursday, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos said on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” that the “Trump effect” is causing a “fear stronger than any wall” that is keeping illegal immigrants from coming into the United States.

Partial transcript as follows:

COOPER: Jorge, the massive drop in border apprehensions last month, the customs border protections says 40 percent, it’s down 40 percent, people trying to cross illegally. What do you make of that? Is it possible that the tough talk on illegal immigration by President Trump is working, that he deserves credit for that drop?”

RAMOS: Let me just say that fear is stronger than any wall. What we are seeing right now is the ‘Trump effect.’”

These people calling their relatives and their friends, saying, “Don’t come here, this is not the right moment.” So I think it is possible. Really no one wants illegal immigration, not even undocumented immigrants. It is very risky for them. It is better to do it in a legal way.

And the other positive thing is that, I think, many Americans, many people who voted for Donald Trump, they really have to understand that there’s no invasion. No one is invading the United States. Mexicans aren’t invading the United States. The undocumented population has remained stable at about 11 million for the last decade. So those are the positive things.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab93a544e:39c9e9:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The Sunni Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) has boasted that key U.S. Middle East ally Saudi Arabia is the top provider of terrorists for the jihadist group in Iraq, reports Fox News, citing Iraqi military sources.

Sunni Saudi Arabia shares an estimated 500-mile-long border with war-ravaged Iraq.

Nevertheless, Fox News reports that the Saudi jihadists crossed into Iraq over the border the country shares with both Turkey and Syria.

The news outlet learned from unnamed Iraqi intelligence sources that jihadist from the Saudi kingdom comprise nearly one-third (up to 30 percent) of all ISIS terrorists in Iraq, adding that “Saudis comprise the largest single contingent of ISIS fighters, with Russian Chechens making up the second-largest contingent.”

Speaking to the news outlet on condition of anonymity, a high-ranking Iraqi intelligence officer said, “The Saudi presence in ISIS is very large. What we have left are mainly Iraqis and Saudis.”

“The Saudis make up a large number of suicide bombers, as they already have the ground work of radicalization installed in their minds from radical sheikhs in Saudi [Arabia]. And we’ve caught important ISIS commanders,” he added.

Fox News points out that it has seen various ISIS-linked photographs and documents showing identification and credit cards of Saudi terrorists.

The report comes nearly a month after an article by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) revealed that President Donald Trump’s administration is considering forming a military alliance with major Middle East allies, including the Sunni Saudi kingdom, to combat Shiite Iran.

President Trump’s anti-Iran coalition would bring together Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Israel, Egypt, and Jordan.

The Sharia law-compliant kingdom Saudi Arabia is regarded as a hotbed and top global exporter of radical Islamic thought, namely the Sunni extremist ideology of Wahhabism, adhered to by ISIS and various other jihadists groups.

Saudi Arabia imposes extremely strict Islamic laws on its citizens.

“Wahhabism was born in Saudi Arabia. Saudi is leading those extremist organizations like ISIS,” an anonymous Iraqi official told Fox News. “They have high-ranking officials and fighters among their ranks. Saudi is nothing without U.S. protection; it is only a bite for Iran to eat.”

Sunni Saudi Arabia considers Shiite Iran its regional rival. Iran exerts tremendous influence over the Shiite-led government of Iraq where militias backed by the Islamic Republic are fighting ISIS.

Saudi Arabia is part of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The Sunni kingdom, which has cracked down on the jihadist group within its borders, has also suffered attacks carried out by ISIS.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab8950d7f:2914a2:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Attorney General (AG) Jeff Sessions indicated that he would advise the commander-in-chief to continue using the U.S. military prison in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to house newly captured jihadists.

Sessions said he sees “no legal problem whatsoever” with doing so. His comments came in response to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asking Sessions what he would tell President Trump if he were to request legal guidance on incarcerating newly captured detainees at the Guantánamo facility, commonly known as Gitmo.

“There’s plenty of space. We’re well-equipped for it. It’s a perfect place for it. Eventually, this will be decided by the military rather than the Justice Department, but I see no legal problem whatsoever with doing that,” responded the new AG.

“I’ve been there a number of times as a senator and it’s just a very fine place for holding these kind of dangerous criminals,” added the former Alabama Republican lawmaker. “We’ve spent a lot of money fixing it up, and I’m inclined to the view that it remains a perfectly acceptable place. And I think a lot of the criticisms have just been totally exaggerated.”

Echoing President Trump, Sessions told Hewitt that he did not support former President Barack Obama’s failed goal to shut down Gitmo, suggesting that he would encourage the new commander-in-chief to keep the facility running.

Sessions did urge the military justice system to speed up the process of Gitmo hearings, telling the conservative radio host, “By now, we should have worked through all the legal complications that the Obama administration seemed to allow to linger and never get decided, so nothing ever happened.”

“So it is time for us in the months to come to get this thing figured out and start using it [military justice system] in an effective way,” he continued. “In general, I don’t think we’re better off bringing these people to federal court in New York and trying them in federal court — where they get discovery rights to find out our intelligence — and get court-appointed lawyers and things of that nature.”

Towards the end of the Obama administration, the military justice system and the former president’s parole-style panel proved to be capable of stepping up court hearings and detainee reviews as Obama pushed to shut down Gitmo.

The attorney general’s comments come nearly a month after the New York Times (NYT) reported that the Trump administration is considering ordering the Pentagon to continue using Gitmo to imprison newly captured terrorists linked to al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.

During his presidential campaign, President Trump vowed to “load [Guantánamo] up with some bad dudes.” The new president has blasted Obama for reducing the number of detainees housed at Gitmo.

Obama failed to keep his campaign promise of shutting down the detention center. The former president blamed his inability to deliver on “congressional restrictions,” explicitly saying, “all these rules and norms and laws” prevented him from emptying out and ultimately closing Gitmo.

However, Obama himself signed into law a bipartisan bill that prohibited him from carrying out his proposal to close down the facility.

The law banned Obama officials from building or modifying U.S. facilities to house Guantánamo prisoners, a key move to facilitate the former president’s plan to shut Gitmo down.

Obama did dramatically reduce the prison’s population, from 242 at the start of his presidency to 41 by the time he left.

His administration liberated many jihadists who had been deemed “forever prisoners,” or too dangerous to release. The U.S. intelligence community has determined that some (20) of the prisoners released by Obama are confirmed (9) or suspected (11) to have re-engaged in terrorist activities.

Nevertheless, the recidivism rate for detainees released by former President George W. Bush is higher — 113 confirmed and 75 suspected of having returned to the battlefield.

Bush (532) did liberate more than three times the amount of prisoners released by Obama (161), which may explain the high recidivism rate. It appears that the more prisoners are released, the higher the likelihood some will return to terrorist activities.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab8950d7f:2914a0:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The jobs market is sizzling.

Domestic employers added a jaw-dropping 235,000 new jobs last month, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.

Both construction and manufacturing saw strong jobs gains.

Economists expected nonfarm payrolls to grow by 190,000, compared with 227,000 in January. Unofficially, however, expectations have been rising this week following a blowout jobs figure from ADP on Wednesday.

Wage pressure remains muted. Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents and 2.8 percent on an annualized basis. The average work week in the private sector was unchanged at 34.4 hours.

January’s employment was revised upward to 238,000 from the earlier read of 227,000.

The employment gains were broad based, occurring in construction, private sector educational services, manufacturing, health care and mining. The jobless rate for adult men and women was 4.3 percent. The labor force participation rate, at 63.0 percent was close to unchanged.

Construction employment increased by 58,000 jobs. Manufacturing added 28,000 jobs. Over the past 3 months, manufacturing has added 57,000 jobs. Health care employment rose by 27,000 jobs. Mining employment increased by 8,000 jobs. Employment in business and professional services rose by 37,000 jobs.

The report covered the first full month of President Donald Trump’s administration. During the 2016 race, Trump was critical of the unemployment rate, arguing that it understated the level of joblessness in the United States.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab8798106:222f54:5fec47d3</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Hungary’s foreign minister praised the foreign policy of President Donald Trump, noting that “his approach towards migration is much better for the whole world than the approach of the Democrats.”

“For us it seems obvious that the security of the U.S. and the safety of the American people is the number one issue for the American president,” said Hungarian Minister Péter Szijjártó in an interview with Breitbart News Wednesday. “What should he deal with if not the security of his country? Who should deal with the security of the U.S. if not the U.S president?”

Szijjártó said that he considers the treatment of President Donald Trump by “international media and the international political elite” to be “really ridiculous.”

Pulling no punches in his critique of the hypocrisy of international elites, the minister said that “whenever Donald Trump says something he is bashed immediately,” and it is expected that everyone will criticize him.

“But my feeling,” he continued, “is that if Hillary Clinton had won this election and had said the same things that Donald Trump has been saying, there would be another type of expectation: that everyone would stand up and give her a standing ovation for such progressive ideas.”

“But just because Donald Trump says these things he must be slammed immediately,” he said.

Trump’s approach to foreign policy, Szijjártó said, “is much better for the whole world than the approach of the Democrats, because he has removed the exportation of democracy from the focus of U.S. foreign policy. In this way he has kept other regions from becoming destabilized.”

“This foolish one-size-fits-all policy,” he added, “created many threats and security issues all over the world by destabilizing governments that might not comply with American standards of democracy, but at least were stable enough to guarantee some security in the region.”

Asked why he thinks Donald Trump is so despised by international elites, Szijjártó responded that “what we represent in politics is a total denial of the international Left represents.”

“We say that national identity is important; we say nation is important; we say patriotism is not bad—on the contrary, it is good. We say religion is important; we say we are proud to be Christian and all these things are a denials of what they believe in or at least what they say,” he said.

Szijjártó said that the Hungarian government is especially appreciative of Trump’s willingness to call a spade a spade.

“Among the media and liberal political elites in Europe, it is virtually impossible to identify challenges for they are,” he said, “and if you cannot name your challenges properly you definitely will not be able to respond appropriately.”

“Take the case of immigration,” he said. “We had to fight for months just to be able to speak of ‘migration.’ Because it was considered a ‘refugee crisis,’ despite the fact that it has nothing to do with a refugee crisis. It is a massive illegal influx of illegal migrants from other parts of the world into Europe.”

“But we had to fight for months just to be able to say that and not be badgered for using an expression of the sort,” he said.

This week, Republicans unveiled the American Health Care Act, the bill written by Congress, and adopted by President Donald Trump, to replace Obamacare (without quite repealing it).

The rollout has been less than stunning. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) made a valiant effort, and the White House is backing him. Yet conservatives in both the House and Senate rejected the bill, Democrats want nothing to do with it, and it looks doomed to fail — if it even comes to a vote.

On the surface, this is a big potential failure for the young Trump presidency. But with the Trump White House, as with the campaign, there is always a certain amount of chaos that is deliberate (though Trump, quite deliberately, never indicates how much).

In this case, the repeal/replace debacle allows the president to improve his leverage over all of the other policymakers: the Republican leadership, the conservative caucus, and the Democratic Party. (Perhaps they just don’t know it yet.)

The Republican leadership will be the most severely chastened. They had six years to devise an alternative to the so-called Affordable Care Act, and came up with a plan that, surprisingly, falls well short of full repeal, while frightening voters who worry about losing their current (albeit expensive, limited, and widely disliked) health insurance plans.

President Trump has shown them he is willing to suffer for supporting them. But he has also proved to them their plans are political non-starters.

The House Freedom Caucus, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and other conservatives are happy to see the Speaker’s bill struggle. But Trump has put them on notice, declaring that he will not back their own plans, and that the only alternative is to let Obamacare fail — with major consequences for the 2018 midterms. (More voters will blame Congress than Obama, fairly or unfairly.) Conservatives do have a unique opportunity to push their own ideas — but they know they must agree to something.

Democrats, meanwhile are bemused by the fact that Obamacare is proving so hard to repeal (not because it works — if it did, Hillary Clinton would have won — but because of the poison political pills Pelosi planted in it). But the fact is that Democrats have 25 Senate seats up for re-election in 2018, of which ten are in states Trump won.

Unless they can vote for a successful replacement for Obamacare, they will be in far more danger than the conservative holdouts. This week has rattled them, too.

In The Art of the Deal — which liberals ought to study as carefully as conservatives studied Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals if they want to begin to understand a president they have only demonized and caricatured thus far — Trump explains that one of his core negotiating principles is: “Protect the Downside and the Upside Will Take Care of Itself.”

Today, the upside is obvious, but extremely elusive: a replacement for Obamacare that does not create new headaches for millions of patients. The downside is failure — either no deal, or a deal that hurts enough people to create a new opposition constituency.

President Trump has used the launch, and decline, of the American Health Care Act to highlight the downside — and take some wind out of the sails of the politicians and policy wonks who convinced themselves they had all the answers. As the bill falters, the next, inevitable step will be for nervous Republican leaders to ask Trump to offer a new plan.

And that plan will be more of a classic Trump bargain — one that does what Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama refused to do: namely, bring all of the stakeholders together, including doctors and patients, to hash out something everyone can accept.

The final flourish will be incorporating the changes as amendments to the American Health Care Act, so Trump can claim to have kept his word, while also allowing Congress to save face.

Do not be fooled by the bill’s early troubles. Another principle in Art of the Deal is: “Deliver the Goods.” Watch.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer rejected the notion that the House effort to repeal and replace Obamacare would fail, assuring that the White House continued to support Speaker Paul Ryan’s effort to replace Obamacare.

“This bill will land on the president’s desk; he will sign it,” Spicer said when asked by Breitbart News if the president would sign the 2015 Obamacare repeal legislation. Sen. Rand Paul and other conservatives have called for their Congressional colleagues to revisit the 2015 bill, citing a wide margin of Republican support for a repeal effort.

Predictions for the success of the bill suffered another blow after Sen. Tom Cotton also came out against the bill on Thursday.

But Spicer repeated his assertion that Ryan’s effort does repeal and replace Obamacare. Conservatives critics of the current plan insist that the bill does not fully replace Obamacare and leaves many elements of Obama’s effort in place until 2020. Spicer dismissed the idea that the White House would sign a bill that wasn’t Ryan’s plan.

“I think the way that we’re doing now is the right and the responsible way to do this,” he said, backing Ryan’s three-pronged solution to address health care.

Spicer described Ryan’s powerpoint presentation earlier in the day on his healthcare plan as “very good” and “phenomenal.”

Officially, President Donald Trump continues to support the House-led effort, as does Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney.

During Ryan’s presentation, Trump wrote on Twitter that negotiations for the bill were going well.

“Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great,” he wrote. “We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab85e01d5:215941:36e281dc</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

On Wednesday, Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman Gen. Paul Selva confirmed to the House Armed Services Committee that Russia has deployed a cruise missile banned under the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty.

More specifically, General Selva said the deployment of ground-launched SSC-8 cruise missiles violates the “spirit and intent” of the INF treaty, which dates back to 1987 and is considered a vital achievement in arms control negotiations.

“The system itself presents a risk to most of our facilities in Europe, and we believe that the Russians have deliberately deployed it in order to pose a threat to NATO and to facilities within the NATO area of responsibility,” Selva told the House Armed Services Committee.

“While senior Trump administration officials have not said where the new unit is based, there has been speculation in media reports that a missile system with similar characteristics is deployed in central Russia. The Times also noted that a second battalion was staged at a missile test range at Kapustin Yar, in southern Russia near Volgograd,” reports the New York Times.

This marks the first official confirmation of Russia’s cruise missile violation. The New York Times wrote a story about the deployment last month, which the Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed as “fake news.”

Reuters quotes Selva saying the Joint Chiefs have been asked to “incorporate a set of options into the nuclear posture review.” President Trump has also stated he would discuss the interview directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin if a meeting between them takes place.

“I don’t have enough information on their intent to conclude other than they do not intend to return to compliance,” Selva added.

Reuters notes prior history suggests the Russians are likely to deny allegations they violated the treaty and leave the missiles where they are, as occurred during a similar situation in 2014. They will likely calculate that the American aversion to a new arms race is strong enough to let a few Russian infractions slide.

Rep. William “Mac” Thornberry (R-TX), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, sounded ready to call that bluff on Wednesday.

“We see what the Russians are doing; they’re not going to stand down out of the goodness of their heart, and so some sort of strong action is important,” he said shortly after Selva’s testimony, as reported by Military.com.

“You’re not going to get rid of a Russian capability by not having a capability of your own,” he added.

Thornberry said he was prepared to “let lawyers consider a legal status of a treaty in which the Russians are in clear violation of.” While those lawyers decide if Russia has effectively abrogated the treaty, Thornberry said he would support faster deployment of long-range U.S. weapons, including the B61 nuclear bomb and LRSO cruise missile.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab6f354f4:14522c9:c9473c70</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI) is slated to introduce legislation Thursday that would block President Trump from using federal funding to pay for a wall along the Mexican border.

“I am not in favor of the wall, but if there is a wall, then I do not want the United States of America to pay for the wall,” Moore told CBS News, saying that American taxpayers should not be burdened by Trump’s campaign promise.

The legislation is called the “No Taxpayer Funding for the Wall Act,” which would prohibit any federal funding, including funding already set aside for that purpose, from going to the wall. The bill has reportedly already gained the support of three dozen Democrats.

Moore is also hoping to gain support from Republicans who are worried about the cost of the border wall.

“My bill gives amazing opportunities, I think, to people like Jim Jordan to opt out of building the wall,” she said, referring to the Republican lawmaker from Ohio. “I’m trying to mobilize some interest in my bill from deficit hawks.”

Other Democrats have scrutinized Trump’s plan to build a border wall, especially over its potential cost.

Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asking the agency to brief the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on how it plans to pay for the border wall by March 13, the Hill reported.

“I request that DHS provide a briefing for the committee regarding DHS’ acquisition process and funding for this requirement,” McCaskill wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, also asking for a formal estimate of the wall’s cost.

The Trump administration is considering a plan that would cut funding to the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to pay for the border wall and other methods of immigration enforcement, the Washington Post reported.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab6d7c719:12193ad:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

The House Ways and Means Committee’s 23-16 passage of the American Health Care Act gave Speaker Paul Ryan (R.-Wis.) a huge victory shortly before 5 a.m. Thursday, closing out more than 15 hours of testimony, amendment votes, and remarks by members of the committee.

“Ways and Means Republicans just passed legislation that will help Americans finally have access to affordable health care,” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R.-Texas), the committee chairman and Ryan’s immediate successor leading the powerful panel.

“We voted repeatedly to end Obamacare’s crushing taxes and mandates and ensure patients have more power over their own health care,” he said.

“This legislation reflects President Trump’s strong commitment to improving health care for all Americans,” Brady said. “I sincerely thank my colleagues for their hard work and commitment to delivering on the President’s promise.”

The senior Democrat on the committee, Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, said in his opening remarks that he was upset about the lack of transparency in the process and the lack of time given to members to read the bill and prepare the committee’s vote.

The bottom line, though is that the American Health Care Act does not improve the situation for regular Americans, he said.

“If Republicans take away critical coverage benefits in the ACA coupled with hurting the middle-class, it would drastically increase costs and lower coverage and quality care,” he added.

“As the Republicans have heard loud and clear during town halls, people are afraid of losing their health insurance,” Neal said. “It would be irresponsible for Republicans to take away health care programs on which their constituents across a broad age and economic spectrum depend.”

Committee Democrats delayed the vote as long as they parliamentarily could.

Democrats used all of their allotted time for questions and remarks–often going over. They also offered dozens of amendments that were ruled out of order by the chairman.

Brady worked out a tandem with Rep. Pat Tiberi (R.-Ohio) to handle the amendments. First, Brady would rule the amendment non-germane to the bill. Then, when the Democrat would object to the ruling, Tiberi, chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, would move to table the objection, but often with a story relating to an American suffering from Obamacare.

New York Democrat Rep. Joseph Crowley took a large poster of an amendment Brady offered during the 2010 Obamacare debate that would have required all members of Congress to certify that they had read the PPACA. Crowley took out a red marker and crossed out Brady’s name and wrote above it his own.

“We haven’t had a single hearing on this bill,” Crowley said.

“It comes after the Republicans kept a draft of the bill under armed guard protection, sending their own members in search of the Capitol in vain looking for the bill,” he said. “Americans should not have to play a game of hide-and-seek to find out the fate of their health care coverage.”

Democrats voted down Brady’s measure in 2010. In 2017, Brady simply ruled it out of order.

Tiberi acknowledged the rich irony of the situation.

“Oh, it’s pretty rich,” Crowley replied. “So is this bill, by the way.”

Tiberi also recalled out loud that despite Crowley’s assertion that members had 30 days to read the Obamacare draft before the Ways and Means vote, Democrats dropped a 794-page amendment at 11:57 p.m., the night before the 9:00 a.m. committee vote.

New Jersey Democrat Rep. Bill Pascrell offered several amendments, including one that would have required President Donald Trump to release his tax returns.

When the American Health Care Act passed the Ways and Means Committee, it moved the bill to the House Budget Committee as a recommendation. Similarly, the Energy and Commerce Committee’s approval of the same bill with the same language goes on to the Budget Committee. If the bill is reported out of the Budget Committee, it must pass the House Rules Committee with a “rule” that lays out how the members will debate the bill on the House floor.

On the House floor, the House will be converted into the Committee of the Whole House, with Rep.

Wednesday on CNN’s “The Messy Truth,” host Van Jones said President Donald Trump was “driving liberals insane,” to the point he does not want “y’all to be in charge either.”

Jones said, “One thing I want to share, progressives tend to focus, when we critique him, on politeness and proper protocols okay? There’s a proper way to deal with reporters or intelligence agencies or judges. And when Trump breaks the rules, we start fanning ourselves and fainting and freaking out and handing out all of these protocol violations. And for his supporters, his appeal has nothing to do with protocol. It has everything to do, though, with pride and prosperity.”

“He’s saying, I want you to be proud of the country and have a job,” he continued. “So liberals seem to only see, like the crazy tweets. And we act like that’s all he’s doing. But his supporters actually ignore those tweets. You want to know the tweets they cherish? The one where he’s taking credit for the stock market that’s rising and their 401(k)s doing better and the jobs he so-called saved. If progressives want to understand Trump supporters, those are the tweets we need to be paying attention to.”

He added, “I think he’s driving liberals insane. I mean that. I think he is. I think he is. And I’m seeing more — I’m seeing liberals and progressives now so mad and distracted and depressed, I’m like, I don’t really want y’all to be in charge either. So it’s — Am I wrong?”

In a thinly veiled reference to President Donald J. Trump, former President Bill Clinton unleashed a warning against the rising “nationalism” he sees across the globe.

“People who claim to want the nation-state are actually trying to have a pan-national movement to institutionalize separatism and division within borders all over the world,” Clinton said during a speech at the liberal Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Politico reported.

“It’s like we’re all having an identity crisis at once — and it is an inevitable consequence of the economic and social changes that have occurred at an increasingly rapid pace,” Clinton added.

With his first major public appearance since his wife lost her second bid for the White House, Clinton lamented the “us vs. them” attitude he sees in the world.

Clinton asked his audience to consider the two choices the “us vs. them” sentiment fosters, asking, “Are we going to live in an us and them world, or a world that we live in together? If you got that, in every age and time, the challenges we face can be resolved in a way to keep us going forward instead of taking us to the edge of destruction.”

The ex-president’s comments are clearly aimed at Donald Trump, though Clinton didn’t utter Trump’s name during the event. Critics of President Trump have accused him of pushing a policy of “nationalism.”

These statements may not be surprising from a figure who has called for wide open borders.

On that terrible day in 2001 that radical Muslim terrorists launched the most devastating attack on the U.S.A. in history, Bill Clinton was in Australia giving a speech before a group of businessmen. In comments made only ten hours before the towers fell in New York, Bill Clinton said he felt the wold would be a better place if there were no national borders.

According to someone with knowledge of the former president’s speech, Clinton said he believes “the world will be a better place if all borders are eliminated – from a trade perspective, from the viewpoint of economic development and in welcoming [the free movement of] people from other cultures and countries.”

An anonymous donor gave $1 million to the New York Times to fund subscriptions for public school students.

The paper’s “sponsor a subscription program” has received more than 15,500 donations and gave 1.3 million students access to the Times’s website, the newspaper said in a statement Thursday.

The Times plans to use this new influx of donations to expand the program to provide a series of educational webinars on subjects ranging from news literacy to the Supreme Court.

President Donald Trump has continuously railed against the Times for what he says is “fake news,” describing the newspaper as “the enemy of the American people.”

The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017

In an exclusive White House interview with Breitbart News from February, Trump said the “intent” of the New York Times is “so evil and bad.”

“If you read the New York Times, if you read the New York Times, it’s—the intent is so evil and so bad,” President Trump said in the interview. “The stories are wrong in many cases, but it’s the overall intent. Look at that paper over the last two years. In fact, they had to write a letter of essentially apology to their subscribers because they got the election so wrong.”

The Times recently released an ad campaign called “The Truth” that aired during the Academy Awards in February. It was their first ad campaign in a decade.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab6bc2a46:11fed18:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggested Thursday that he would be open to the appointment of an outside counsel to review actions taken by the Justice Department during the Obama administration.

Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Sessions in an interview if the new attorney general would consider designating an outside counsel “not connected to politics” to take a second look at Justice Department actions that provoked Republican ire in the last eight years. Those include the Fast and Furious gun scandal and the decisions against bringing criminal charges over Hillary Clinton’s email practices or the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of conservative groups.

Hewitt contended during his radio interview that the department had become “highly politicized” in the Obama administration and floated the idea of a special review by an attorney with the authority to bring criminal charges and “just generally to look at how the Department of Justice operated.”

Sessions was noncommittal but left the door open, saying he would do everything he could to “restore the independence and professionalism of the Department of Justice.”

“So we would have to consider whether or not some outside special counsel is needed,” Sessions said. “Generally, a good review of that internally is the first step before any such decision is made.”

The exchange reflected the lingering deep partisan anger over the Justice Department’s decision to close without charges the Clinton email investigation and a separate probe into how the IRS processed requests for tax-exempt applications.

Sessions said the outcome of the IRS case, in particular, remained “of real concern.” The Justice Department in 2015 found mismanagement at the tax agency but no evidence that it had targeted a political group based on its viewpoints or obstructed justice.

Democrats have called for an outside counsel to probe possible contacts between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Sessions recused himself last week from any investigation that touches the campaign, and Rod Rosenstein, the prosecutor nominated as his deputy, would not commit at his confirmation hearing this week to step aside from any such investigation.

During the campaign, President Donald Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Clinton, though he expressed ambivalence about that idea after he won the election.

It’s not clear how serious Sessions was about the idea of a special counsel to investigate past Justice Department decisions, or how such an undertaking might work.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab6bc2a46:11fed14:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Four Democrat-led states are currently suing President Donald Trump over Executive Order 13780, temporarily restricting immigration from seven terror-prone nations, and that number of states will likely grow in the next few days. At least one of these legal challenges appears headed for the Supreme Court.

Many of the 20 lawsuits filed over Trump’s first executive order (EO) are being dismissed, but when EO 13780 revoked and replaced the first EO, several states decided instead to press forward, insisting that the new EO is still a “Muslim ban.”

Trump signed EO 13769 on Jan. 27. Washington State sued on Jan. 30, joined by Minnesota. Judge James Robart of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington issued a rare temporary restraining order (TRO) on Feb. 3, blocking the EO.

There were several reasons that the federal trial court and the appeals court could have dismissed the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction. Instead, on Feb. 9 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the TRO.

Although longstanding constitutional principles should require the Washington State lawsuit to be dismissed because EO 13780 has provisions different from EO 13769, and thus any legal challenge should have to start over at the beginning, the plaintiffs have asked Judge Robart instead to regard the new EO as a continuation of the first EO and continue to block the policy.

On Mar. 9, Oregon was permitted to intervene as another plaintiff in Washington and Minnesota’s case. The attorney general of New York has announced that the Empire State would seek to intervene in that case as well.

The previous day, on Mar. 8, the State of Hawaii filed its own separate lawsuit challenging the order in the federal district court in the Aloha State. Hawaii is represented by former U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal and a team from his powerhouse law firm, Hogan Lovells.

Both of these cases will eventually end up before the same appeals court: the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. It is possible from there that one or more of these cases could go to the Supreme Court, perhaps on an expedited schedule.

Washington v. Trump is No. 2:17cv141 in the Western District of Washington.

Hawaii v. Trump is No. 1:17cv50 in the District of Hawaii.

On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” Vice President Mike Pence stated of the Obamacare replacement bill, “I think we’re going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we’re all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we’ve replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people’s choices and giving states more flexibility, then that’s where we’re headed.”

Pence said, “[T]he legislation introduced this week in the House begins that process [of repealing and replacing Obamacare]. We’re open and talking about ways we can improve that bill, but that combined with administrative action by the secretary of Health and Human Service,s and ultimately by, likely additional legislation, will get us to a point before we get to the spring this year where Obamacare will be gone, and it will be replaced with the kind of healthcare system that gives the American people more choices in their health insurance and gives states more freedom and more flexibility to provide Medicaid in the best way they see fit for our most vulnerable.”

When asked about objections to the repeal and replace in three phases, Pence responded, “I think they can count on President Trump’s going to be a man of his word. And the president made a commitment to not only repeal Obamacare, but to replace it with the kind of reforms that would allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance, and by giving states the flexibility to implement reforms in Medicaid a little bit like we did in the state of Indiana, where those programs will better serve our most vulnerable citizens.”

He further stated, in response to a question the bill can be changed, “I think we’re going to listen intently to conservative leaders. … [W]hat President Trump has said, to our whole team, is continue to engage members. This is the bill, but if there are ways to improve that bill and give people greater confidence that we’re all going to arrive at the same place where Obamacare is done and we’ve replaced it with the kind of healthcare reforms that will lower the cost of health insurance by expanding people’s choices and giving states more flexibility, then that’s where we’re headed.”

Pence was then asked, “So, eventually it’s going to come down to that binary choice. And you’re going to expend political capital to make sure it gets across the finish line?”

He answered, “President Donald Trump is a man of his word. … [H]e decided, the day after the election Bret, that that number one priority, the first priority of the Congress when they came back, is to keep his word to repeal and replace Obamacare. And we’re going to make sure it happens.”

He concluded, “The central element of the president’s vision for healthcare reform is to expand to a national marketplace, to allow the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines. … The president and I envision an American healthcare economy where people literally have hundreds or even thousands of health insurance products, not ordered by the government, but that they can choose from, and have some assistance from the government through tax credits and other ways to participate.”

Bloomberg’s U.S. Consumer Comfort Index has reached its highest point in a decade following positive assessments about the economy and the buying climate, according to Bloomberg Markets.

The consumer comfort index rose to 50.6 as of March 5, the highest it has been since March 2007, from 49.8. The index has surpassed 50 only six times since April 2002.

A measure of the economy rose to 48.2, the highest since August 2001, from 46.8, while a measure of buying climate rose to 44.5, the highest since April 2002, from 43.7.

The stock market has jumped to record highs and the job market has been particularly strong since President Trump’s inauguration, causing the consumer comfort index to rise.

Respondents to the index view the buying climate as the most favorable it has been in 15 years, a sign that there might be an uptick in household spending after a slow start in 2017.

Sentiment has been strong among Republicans as well as political independents, who were the most confident about the economy and the buying climate since July 2001.

Republicans’ sentiment has surpassed that of the Democrats by the most since September 2013. Confidence among people in the South and Midwest, part-time employees, and married Americans rose.

For part-time employees, they were the most confident since October 2015, while married Americans saw the highest levels of comfort in a decade.

Confidence did, however, fall for people living in the West and Northeast.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab64df5b9:1378f9f:c9473c70</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

This week in an interview with the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said the Democratic Party’s “agenda and approach” had shown “enormous neglect” of voters, which he blamed for the “ultimate failure” of electing President Donald Trump.

Sanders said, “At the end of the day, being in the minority here in the Senate, the minority in the House, having a right-wing Republican president, the only way we are going to win this ― and I think we can win this ― is when millions of people stand up, especially in states that Trump carried, and say, ‘Excuse me. We did not elect you to be president to throw us off of health care. We did not elect you to be president to cut back on the child care we desperately need. That’s not why we elected you.&apos;”

When asked if there was a bit of neglect of voters by Democrats, Sanders continued, “Not a bit of neglect, an enormous amount of neglect. The truth is, and I think anyone who objectively assesses the situation has to appreciate, that the model the Democrats have followed for the last 10 to 20 years has been an ultimate failure. That’s just the objective evidence. We are taking on a right-wing extremist party whose agenda is opposed time after time, issue after issue by the vast majority of the American people. Yet we have lost the White House, the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, almost two-thirds of the governors’ chairs and close to 900 legislative seats all over this country. How can anyone not conclude that the Democratic agenda and approach has been a failure?”

U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos says her department is committed to ensuring every child is “respected” in his or her learning environment.

DeVos’s statement, released after meeting with representatives from LGBT rights groups, made clear that all children are deserving of respect and acceptance, without singling out any one particular group of students.

The secretary said:

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak directly with these families, students and community leaders about their concerns, thoughts, fears and suggestions. Every school and every school leader has a moral responsibility to protect all students and ensure every child is respected and can learn in an accepting environment. I remain committed to advocating for and fighting on behalf of all students. Today’s meeting was compelling, moving and welcomed, and part of an ongoing dialogue with families and students throughout the country.

DeVos met with transgender students and their parents; Stephanie White, executive director of Equality Michigan – from DeVos’s home state; Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN; Nathan Smith, director of public policy of GLSEN; and Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.

The LGBT rights leaders reportedly discussed their concerns about President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the Obama administration’s directive that caused school bathroom and locker room use to be an issue under the oversight of the federal government. Trump said policy about bathrooms and other private spaces should be under the purview of the states.

“We highlighted the pervasive violence and discrimination that the majority of transgender students face across the country, including being prevented from using their correct name and pronouns and appropriate school facilities, Byard said in a press release statement about the meeting with the secretary. “We told DeVos about the immediate impact of withdrawing the guidance, and discussed ways that she might be able to mitigate the pain, fear, and confusion that decision has caused.”

Keisling said in a recent C-SPAN interview that parents who oppose their children and teenagers being forced to share bathrooms and shower rooms with children of the opposite sex must begin “putting aside their prejudices.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab64df5b9:1378f9d:c9473c70</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Swiss financial services company Credit Suisse is warning that coffee giant Starbucks’ announcement of a plan to hire 10,000 Muslim refugees has clearly hurt the company by negatively impacting sales and damaging the company’s brand.

“Our work shows a sudden drop in brand sentiment following announcement of the refugee hiring initiative on Jan. 29th, to flattish from a run-rate of ~+80 (on an index of -100 to +100). Net sentiment has since recovered, but has seen significant volatility in recent weeks,” equity analyst Jason West said, according to CNBC.

At the end of February, it was reported that the Starbucks Coffee brand took a major hit after its Muslim “refugee” announcement made in January in response to President Donald Trump’s temporary travel moratorium.

According to the survey, after the company issued its anti-Trump statement, its brand name lost favor with customers. Perception levels of the Starbucks brand name fell by an incredible two-thirds since January, according to a YouGov survey, Yahoo Finance reported.

Before the company’s refugees hiring announcement, 30% of respondents said they would consider spending money at Starbucks. But after the new policy was revealed, that number fell sharply to only 24 percent.

The company’s announcement immediately sparked a #BoycottStarbucks movement on Twitter and brought condemnation from coast to coast.

Many Americans took umbrage at the policy announcement, wondering why Starbucks is hiring refugees and slighting the hiring of Americans — especially U.S. military veterans.

The attacks worried Starbucks enough that it felt the need to issue a second statement to explain to America’s military veterans that the company doesn’t actually hate them.

House Speaker Paul Ryan is openly targeting House Republicans with television advertisements—while conspicuously not hitting Democratic members—to try to browbeat them into supporting his healthcare legislation.

The remarkable development, in which a GOP leadership-connected organization is now opening fire on the airwaves against Ryan’s own members, is ultimately one of the main tactics employed by Ryan’s predecessor, former House Speaker John Boehner—one that was instrumental in forcing his resignation in 2015.

And while this is going on, with Ryan unrelentingly pushing for this American Health Care Act—nicknamed by many Republicans who oppose it “Ryancare,” “Obamacare 2.0,” or “Obamacare Lite”—members in the House GOP conference are beginning to whisper about replacing not just Obamacare but replacing Ryan as Speaker.

“A group with close ties to House Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), is airing a half-million dollars’ worth of television ads in more than two dozen media markets urging unruly conservatives to support GOP health-care legislation,” the Washington Post’s Mike DeBonis reported on Thursday.

Particularly, the group American Action Network—a group the Post notes is “affiliated with” Ryan’s Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC—“is targeting 30 members it says are part of the House Freedom Caucus,” DeBonis writes.

“The Republicans’ American Health Care Act versus Obamacare,” a narrator says in the Ryan-connected ads. “Obamacare is full of job-destroying mandates. The new plan eliminates them. Obamacare put bureaucrats in control. The Republican plan puts patients and doctors in charge. Obamacare stuck families with soaring premiums. The new plan provides more choices and lower costs.”

Most of those claims are untrue. The Ryan bill does not eliminate Obamacare’s individual mandate, the highly controversial part of Obamacare that forced all Americans to buy a health insurance plan even if they did not want one or face a tax penalty collected by the IRS. Ryan’s bill still forces all Americans to buy healthcare, but gives the penalty collected for not doing so to insurance companies.

The bureaucrats versus patients and doctors claim can also be challenged, given that the AARP and the American Medical Association both oppose the bill, while the bureaucrat-connected Washington establishment organization the U.S. Chamber of Commerce backs Ryan’s plan.

And the claim this bill cuts costs doesn’t hold muster either, as everyone from Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) to the House Freedom Caucus to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) are concerned Ryan’s bill actually does the reverse.

The ad then cuts to President Trump’s recent address to a joint session of Congress, where Trump says he wants to “repeal and replace Obamacare.”

The bill does not repeal Obamacare. It just amends it. In fact, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Cotton laid out how the bill “will not deliver on the main promises of President Trump and congressional Republicans” of repealing and replacing Obamacare. Nonetheless, the ad’s narrator concludes by blaming Trump for Ryan’s bill and urging the Republican members Ryan is targeting to “vote with President Trump.” While the narrator says that, the text “repeal and replace Obamacare”—again, inaccurately claiming the bill repeals Obamacare—appears on screen.

This comes as Ryan is unlikely at this time–despite whatever he says at press conferences–to get 218 votes to pass this legislation on the House floor. Heritage Foundation president former U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina says that Ryan does have the votes to pass the bill in the House, as do many others.

.@JimDeMint: &quot;I think there are enough votes right now in the House to stop the bill as it is.&quot; pic.twitter.com/GCu7XtYnoW — Fox News (@FoxNews) March 9, 2017

House Republicans are furious that Ryan is using precious resources and money that could be used to beat Democrats in 2018 midterm elections to attack his own members.

“This is the beginning of his downfall,” one House Republican, who wished not to be named, told Breitbart News of Ryan’s decision to open fire on his own conference with television ads. The member noted that it was about two years ago exactly that Boehner did the same thing, and his days were numbered after that.

“I think Paul Ryan sees himself as about as untouchable as John Boehner did and that’s a dangerous position of hubris,” another member told Breitbart News.

One member told Breitbart News that Ryan explicitly promised, during a meeting with the House Freedom Caucus in the fall of 2015 around the time he announced his campaign for the Speakership, that he would absolutely not engage in this tactic used by Boehner—television ads to browbeat Republicans into supporting leadership initiatives.

Brendan Buck, Ryan’s chief spokesman, has not responded to requests for comment as to why the Speaker is targeting his own members with television ads and why he is breaking the promise he made to House Republicans that he would not use this Boehner-crafted tactic to push leadership initiatives.

While it’s certainly still too early to predict if any coup on Ryan would be successful—or if any serious one may materialize at all—the fact that members of the House Republican conference are even whispering about this is remarkable in and of itself.

Less than two months into President Donald Trump’s administration, nobody thought Republicans would be engaged in an internecine war over a bill that some claim repeals Obamacare but actually does not. Nor did anyone think that Ryan’s lack of organization on the issue that supposedly united Republicans for seven years since Obamacare first passed would be—given his failure to put forward a plan that achieves Trump’s and Republicans’ objectives of repealing and replacing Obamacare—even close to contemplating any effort to vote for a Republican alternative to Ryan as Speaker of the House.

Before Trump’s landslide electoral college victory over Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton on Nov. 8 in the general presidential election, it was widely presumed that Ryan was in fact in serious trouble over his speakership—and that there were enough Republicans willing to vote for an alternative as Speaker in 2017. Trump’s win, and particularly his win in Wisconsin, saved Ryan for the time-being. But the honeymoon is over.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab5fb5e29:130282a:c9473c70</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

NEW YORK (AFP) – French-Swiss group LafargeHolcim is ready to sell its cement to build US President Donald Trump’s controversial border wall, the company’s CEO said in an interview.

The wall Trump promised to erect along the US-Mexico border, valued at tens of billions of dollars, is at the center of a diplomatic crisis between Mexico City and Washington and is provoking criticism around the world.

“We are prepared to supply our materials to all types of infrastructure projects in the United States,” LafargeHolcim chief Eric Olsen told AFP.

“We are the leader in cement, so we supply all our customers,” he said. “We are here to support the building and development of the United States.”

Asked about possible consequences for the company’s reputation, Olsen stressed that LafargeHolcim is not a political entity.

“We are here to supply our customers’ needs,” he said. “We don’t have a political view on things.”

He refused to comment on a possible victory for the extreme right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election, a prospect increasingly worrying international business and financial circles.

Olsen also declined to comment on the indirect financing by Lafarge in 2013 and 2014 of armed groups in Syria, a country torn by civil war, to keep one of its cement plants active.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called Thursday on the company to “think carefully” before supplying material to build the Mexico wall, insisting it had social and environmental accountability. He also noted the Syria issue.

Ayrault said Lafarge “should think about its own interests, as there are other clients around the world who are going to view this with a degree of surprise.”

– Boycott risk? –

While this apolitical stance risks causing the firm bad publicity, especially in Europe, the material impact on sales likely would be negligible because LafargeHolcim does not sell cement directly to ordinary consumers.

The company is therefore shielded from a potential boycott like the one targeting Uber, which was criticized for its slow reaction to the first travel ban by the Trump administration, blocking travelers from several Muslim-majority countries. Thousands of customers deleted the app from their phones.

In contrast to LafargeHolcim, Irish cement manufacturer CRH, also with a presence in the US market, already announced it will not supply its materials for the border wall.

– US jobs –

The stakes are high for LafargeHolcim, a group created in 2015 by the merger of French cement manufacturer Lafarge and its Swiss counterpart Holcim.

The company hopes to be one of the big winners of the $1 trillion infrastructure investment program Trump has promised to renovate bridges, tunnels, roads and airports.

Olsen noted “there is going to be a significant increase in infrastructure spending,” although the benefits are not likely to be felt this year “because it takes time for these infrastructure projects to get going.”

But “it will partially affect our business in 2018 and certainly in 2019, 2020 and 2021.”

The company is “very well positioned to serve that demand,” he said.

The cement maker, which returned to profitability last year after losses in 2015, is expected to announce the creation of new US jobs in the coming weeks, a topic central to Trump’s agenda.

“I don’t have a specific number,” Olsen said, but “we will be creating jobs.”

Another element that could appeal to Trump, who has been hammering for weeks on his strategy of giving priority to US employees, merchandise and companies: LafargeHolcim has production sites in Texas and operations in New Mexico and Arizona, three of the four US states bordering Mexico.

The group has also built two new plants in Maryland and Oklahoma and opened new facilities in New York and Missouri in anticipation of the ongoing recovery in the US construction sector.

This strong presence on US soil could tip the balance in favor of LafargeHolcim against Mexican cement maker Cemex.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab5dfe041:12b96a3:c9473c70</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

NBC News chairman Andy Lack said Tuesday that President Donald Trump “has us a bit more focused on temperament than we expected,” but he derided Trump’s complaints about “fake news” and the role the media has played in covering the campaign and now the administration.

“We’re not the opposition party, and we’re not in a popularity contest with this administration or any administration,” Lack said at a panel discussion at New York’s IESE Business School, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

That referred to remarks made by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in an interview in February, in which he said, “I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.”

This sentiment was later back by President Trump when he told an interviewer, “I think the media’s the opposition party in many ways.”

Lack said an adversarial relationship between the press and the president is “fundamental to our democracy. We go through periods where we’re in the crosshairs, we’re targeted.”

“Here we are again,” he asserted. “We’re not going to be intimidated by that. I think it’s a distraction from what we’d like to focus on, which is policy.”

But NBC News has not always met that mark.

According to the New York Post, the Wikileaks dump of Democratic National Committee emails included one from CNBC anchor John Harwood to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta saying, “Let’s be honest, is this a comic-book version of a presidential campaign?”

Another email to Podesta said, “I imagine … that Obama feels some (sad) vindication at this demonstration of his years-long point about the opposition party veering off the rails.”

On election night, Rachel Maddow said on MSNBC, “I mean, to have the first African-American president succeeded by a guy who was endorsed by the KKK … it’s a big deal.”

Earlier in the fall, Lawrence O’Donnell, also of MSNBC, called Trump “an imbecile candidate.”

And before that, Maddow said, “I’ve been reading a lot about what it was like when Hitler first became chancellor. I think that’s possibly where we are” if Trump is elected.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab5c432e1:10c178e:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Black Lives Matter activist and Christian minister Nyle Fort, a doctoral candidate at Princeton University who calls for revolutionary violence in the face of “white supremacist terror,” will return to Bucknell University this week.

As a part of an ongoing lecture series organized by the Griot Institute at Bucknell University entitled, “The Black Body (Re)Considered,” activist Nyle Fort will return to campus to “explore the moral and spiritual dimensions of the Black Lives Matter movement.” His lecture is co-sponsored by the English department.

In the July/August 2014 issue of Syndicate Theology, a Christian-based periodical, Fort wrote,”under conditions of white supremacist terror, revolutionary violence can be an expression of Christian love.”

I addressed Mr. Fort’s work last year in the introduction to an event featuring then-Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, arguing that that the administration’s liberal politics motivated their respective responses (or lack thereof) to the Yiannopoulos and Fort events.

Before Yiannopoulos spoke at Bucknell last February, the administration sent out a 400-word email to calm the community’s concerns over his upcoming visit. Bridget Newell, then the university’s Associate Provost for Diversity, suggested that Yiannopoulos’ values contradicted the “qualities of inclusiveness and respect that we want to emulate” at Bucknell.

Although he criticized President Obama and the Black Lives Matter movement in his event at Bucknell, Yiannopoulos argued that “there is stuff left to do on race in America…(African-Americans) are still owed something.” Yiannopoulos addressed the struggles faced particularly by African-American females, who he suggested are on the receiving end of cross-sectional institutional discrimination.

Just weeks before Yiannopoulos appearance, Fort spoke at Bucknell without the smallest amount of resistance from those in the community on the right. This week, he’ll return to Bucknell in the aftermath of an incident in which Bucknell Professor Marcellus Andrews slandered my peers and me, publicly calling us “racists” and instructing students to “impose a steep and lasting price” on us for organizing last year’s Yiannopoulos event.

“I praise Mr. Ciccotta for helping the young and dark understand that there is not much that the administration can do about racism on campus, because y’all can’t,” Bucknell Professor Marcellus Andrews wrote in an email to University President John Bravman and I after I brought my concerns over Andrews’ conduct to the administration.

If there were to be “revolutionary violence” at Bucknell, as Fort calls for, who would it be directed towards?

In a political climate in which the labels “racist” and “white supremacist” are thrown around arbitrarily without hesitation, and sometimes, without legitimate cause, Fort’s call for violence should be deeply concerning to university administrators that host him on their campuses.

Fort even acknowledges that his theories on violence are controversial, but justifies his radicalism by arguing that the theological concept of a god being “one in three persons” is equally controversial, but nonetheless worthy of serious consideration.

To say Christian love can embody revolutionary violence is controversial. But so is saying God is “One in three persons”! Just because something is controversial doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take it seriously or even embrace it. The idea of the Trinity is controversial to many as is revolutionary violence. Interestingly, however, most Christians are silent about State violence on black bodies, and yet condemn the very idea of those same bodies engaging in counter, revolutionary violence.

He adds that Christians must start to recognize “that the face of Jesus Christ is the body of Michael Brown,” because “Jesus shows up in the suffering of black bodies and all the world’s cruciﬁed peoples.”

Fort, of course, should be allowed to speak, even without a disclaimer from the University, but it is concerning that the same community that took such issue with Yiannopoulos’ brand of provocation and humor gave Minister Fort, and his justification of violence in the name of Christianity, a warm embrace, and will do so again this week at Bucknell a second time.

This isn’t a conversation about violence, but rather the failure of university administrations to act objectively when faced with politically-charged matters. Last week, before American Enterprise Institute Scholar Charles Murray spoke at Middlebury College, the school’s president Laurie Patton injected her personal politics into the discussion and denouncing his scholarship, claiming that she “profoundly disagrees with much of Mr. Murray’s views.”

In January, Dean of Students Amy Badal attended a candlelight vigil held at Bucknell in response to President Trump’s executive order on immigration. Can students feel comfortable expressing their support of such legislation on campus if administrators like Badal are willing to take such a strong and public stance?

Instead of defending my peers and I against Andrews’ threat and accusations of racism, Badal and the administration claimed that I had “mischaracterized” the email (which you can read in its entirety here). The administration argued that the university “values and encourages the free exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives,” despite the texts assigned throughout my economics curriculum consisting almost exclusively of leftist and anti-free market perspectives.

University administrators must adopt an objective set of moral principles that isn’t derived from partisan ideology if they are to ensure that all students are treated fairly, educated comprehensively, and so that they can rightfully condemn conduct that infringes upon students’ ability to participate in the tradition of open intellectual inquiry upon which the academy was founded.

There will be no immediate overhaul or reforms to the H-1B foreign guest worker visa program, according to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.

In a media briefing, Spicer said President Donald Trump would be reviewing a number of immigration issues that include H-1B visas, but said any reforms to the system before foreign workers could begin applying for the visas on April 1, 2017 would not occur.

“I think there is the legal part of immigration and then the illegal part of immigration,” Spicer said, according to The Hindu. “The President’s actions that he’s taken in terms of his executive order and other revamping of immigration policy have focused on our border security, keeping our country safe, our people safe. And then, obviously, whether it’s H-1B visas or the other one — spousal visas — other areas of student visas, I think there is a natural desire to have a full look at — a comprehensive look at that.”

The open borders lobby has shifted much of their focus away from Trump’s initiatives on illegal immigration and are now in defensive mode on the issue of H-1B visas, as Breitbart Texas reported.

India-based media and open border groups are particularly worried of any kinds of changes to the H-1B visa program, as the system largely favors young, male Indian workers who fill American tech-industry jobs.

The Trump Administration’s inaction to move on the H-1B visa program could see pushback from immigration hawks and voters, as only 30 percent of Americans see the program as necessary, Breitbart Texas reported.

Trump does remain aware of issues regarding the current legal immigration system. In an interview with POLITICO, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said Trump seemed to endorse his and Sen. David Perdue’s (R-GA) “RAISE Act,” which will cut legal immigration by 50 percent over a period of time.

The legislation would also reduce the number of green cards issued every year from about one million to 500,000; end extended family chain migration to the U.S.; eliminate the 50,000 visas granted to foreigners under the diversity visa lottery; and permanently cap U.S. refugees resettlement to 50,000 per year.

Some 85,000 H-1B visas are allotted to foreign workers every year through the U.S. government’s visa lottery program, which has long been criticized by Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

TBS’ late-night comedy show Full Frontal with Samantha Bee issued an apology Thursday after a video segment mocked a conservative man for sporting a “Nazi” haircut when in fact he suffers from Stage 4 brain cancer.

“This year, the bow ties were gone, replaced by Nazi hair, Nazi hair, Nazi hair… and CPAC was decidedly Trump country.” a Full Frontal correspondent says in the video clip, as multiple images of young men with partially shaved heads appear on screen.

One image, however, showed Kyle Coddington, who, according to his sister, Megan, is suffering from “stage 4 brain cancer.”

“When @iamsambee makes fun of your brother for having ‘Nazi hair.’ He actually has stage 4 brain cancer, but whatever floats your boat,” Megan wrote on Twitter Thursday morning.

According to a GoFundMe page created for Kyle by a family friend last December, the young man is currently fighting an incurable form of cancer called glioblastoma. But Kyle’s doctors say his condition is not a death sentence, and the young man says he believes “God is still in the miracle-making business.”

“I’m putting complete trust in God and I know regardless of the outcome, I’ll be healed one way or another!” Kyle says.

The Full Frontal segment mocking Coddington has been scrubbed from the TBS show’s YouTube page.

However, a clip of the jarring bit has been provided below.

Bee’s late-night show has relentlessly attacked both President Donald Trump and the GOP since its debut in February 2016. The late-night host has previously blamed white people for “ruining America” and recently teamed up with TheBlaze mogul Glenn Beck to fight “Trumpism.”

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), a leading GOP senator, is warning his friend House Speaker Paul Ryan to “take a pause” and slow down when it comes to healthcare reform.

Cotton told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview when asked what he would say to Ryan were he speaking directly to the embattled Speaker:

Take a pause, lower the stakes, we don’t need to meet arbitrary legislative deadlines. We need to keep our promise to make healthcare more affordable, more accessible and hassle-free for all Americans. The legislation they’ve introduced can be a starting point but it needs major changes. Those changes can be perused and analyzed and tested at hearings. Then we can move forward with a more deliberative fashion in committee to propose amendments and cast votes so we’re not rushing through in the dark of night 36 hours after the bill is introduced. Then the Senate can take the same process and we can work out what differences we might have. That, ultimately, would yield the right result even if it takes a little bit longer. Our healthcare system has had many problems for many years, well before Obamacare—and Obamacare has made them worse—what we need to do is not focus on arbitrary deadlines but focus on finally solving these problems.

Ryan is rushing a bill—the American Health Care Act, or Obamacare 2.0, or Obamacare Lite, or Ryancare as it has become known—through the House of Representatives right now. But Cotton, a U.S. Senator, tells Breitbart News in this exclusive phone interview on Thursday afternoon that Ryan should back off. Cotton told Breitbart News that this plan by Ryan does not follow through on President Trump’s and other Republicans’ plans to repeal Obamacare, then replace it with a healthcare system that works better for all Americans.

Cotton told Breitbart News:

We need to get healthcare reform right. We don’t need to get it fast. The House bill as drafted will not deliver on the main promises of President Trump and congressional Republicans, which is making healthcare affordable, keeping it accessible and reducing the level of stress and hassle in the lives of Americans. The process by which the House is considering this legislation and the breakneck pace at which they’re operating is not going to fix this. You can’t introduce major legislation on a Monday night and vote on it Wednesday morning without even having time to process it. We’re not having any hearings to lay a fact-based foundation of knowledge to understand the very thorny questions that healthcare reform poses. It’s much better that we take a pause and do so to get healthcare reform right than to get it right.

The bill as introduced does not repeal Obamacare as proponents falsely claim—it only amends it—and it keeps Obamacare’s Cadillac Tax and individual mandate. With the individual mandate, for people who choose not to buy insurance, the bill merely shifts the penalty from Obamacare’s government-collected tax to a fee collected by insurance companies. There are many more issues with the bill, but the individual mandate question is one that Cotton is particularly concerned about. He went on to say:

This is one small instance of a provision I don’t think we understand in this bill. It creates a kind of tax credit to helps low income Americans afford their healthcare and it pays it to the insurance companies not to taxpayers—not to the Americans who need it to buy health insurance. I simply don’t understand why we would take that approach. That’s one of the problems with Obamacare—including too many giveaways to insurance companies.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), in his own exclusive interview with Breitbart News a day earlier, is calling for Trump to support the 2015 bill in which both chambers of Congress voted successfully to repeal Obamacare—and then do a separate replacement bill the same day. Cotton said he is open to Paul’s ideas, and other ideas on this front, but wants everyone to think about this and slow down and move off the Ryan bill.

Cotton said when asked if he backs Sen. Paul’s idea for Obamacare repeal and replacement:

I’m open to lots of legislative approaches except for ramming through major legislation in 36 hours in the dark of night. Paul’s idea for Obamacare repeal and replacement. “written spending bill in late December. Introduce it on Monday, vote on it on Wednesday morning and everyone goes home for Christmas—and hey, who cares because it’s all going to expire in nine months anyway. We ought not do that on spending bills, but we surely ought not do it on healthcare reforms. As we all said on Obamacare, we are remaking one sixth of the nation’s economy and something that affects every single American in a personal and intimate fashion.

Cotton said he has spoken with President Trump in “broad contours” about healthcare and looks forward to future conversations with him about it.

“We’ve only spoken in broad contours about healthcare, and I’ve expressed to him it’s a complicated topic and we have to take our time and get it right—not fast,” Cotton said.

With Cotton, Paul, and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) out publicly against the Ryan bill as is—and Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Susan Collins (R-ME) saying it is dead on arrival in the Senate—it has no chance to pass the U.S. Senate. There is also significant opposition to the bill inside the GOP conference in the House, with the House Freedom Caucus and many more members outside the Freedom Caucus opposed to it in the House. Cotton said the bill will likely not, despite what Ryan says over and over, pass the House of Representatives. Cotton said:

I would encourage my old friends in the House to slow down and fix the many problems in this bill before they vote on it. If they do that, it can pass and it can pass with a big majority. And I think that’d be good for the American people. But if they move forward with the legislation that was introduced Monday, I have real doubts about whether it can pass the House of Representatives and there’s no need for that to happen because we are relatively close to the right kind of reform that’s better for the American people. It’s better to spend a few weeks getting that right than moving it fast.

If somehow politicians in Washington were able to navigate the significant GOP opposition to this bill and force it through to passage, Cotton added, there is likely to be significant political backlash against anyone who supports it and anyone who supports this rushed Obamacare-like process.

“I’m more concerned about the implications for the Arkansans I represent,” Cotton said. “Arkansans are either losing their health insurance or continuing to have to pay higher and higher premiums. But you can be sure, if that’s the result, that it will be politically hazardous to the health of people who supported this process and those who supported a bill that produces this result. I’m not trying to stop the repeal of Obamacare and healthcare reform. I’m trying to fix it. I’m trying to help President Trump achieve the goals on which he and all of us campaigned. Right now, the House bill—as drafted—I don’t think does that.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab58d23fd:1081021:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

President Donald Trump again tweeted support for the House Obamacare replacement plan just as House Speaker Paul Ryan wheeled in a television screen to deliver a PowerPoint presentation to explain the bill to reporters.

“Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!”

Trump’s message is an effort to signal support for Ryan and his House plan to replace Obamacare despite a whirlwind of conservative dissent over the bill.

Key senators and House conservatives have loudly protested the bill, calling it Obamacare Lite or Obamacare 2.0.

Trump met with conservative Tea Party groups on Wednesday evening to hear their concerns with the bill, opening up the possibility for minor changes to the legislation.

“This is going to be great. You’re going to make it even greater,” Trump said to the groups, according to a source speaking to CNN’s Jim Acosta.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab53a6e89:11b7f44:c9473c70</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Actress Alyssa Milano says the task of “removing” President Donald Trump from office is up to the women of the United States.

“Trump has proven that he really can’t take the heat in the White House kitchen. But, he won’t get out of it, either. His ego won’t let him. Removing him will be up to us,” the Who’s the Boss actress wrote in an essay published in Marie Claire.

Milano says the “crushing, life-altering blow” of Trump’s election spurred women to begin “organizing the resistance.”

The actress writes:

“Most of us thought—no, assumed—that when we woke up on November 9, 2016, we’d be looking into the poised and confident face of the first female president. We stepped up! The powerful Hillary Clinton, a lifelong civil servant, politician, wife, mother, and former First Lady seemed to embody all the glorious elements of a modern leader. Instead, we arose to the sinister smirk of her opponent, the ‘dark horse.’ All we heard were our hearts drop over the deafening mic drop.”

The 44-year-old actress later describes Trump as “an egomaniac with no political experience, questionable business ethics, and a crude moral compass” who “has been charged with running our big, beautiful, diverse, country.”

Milano’s essay came on International Women’s Day, which saw anti-Trump #DayWithoutAWoman protests around the world and in the U.S., organized by leftist Women’s March activists.

The actress says Trump’s election forced women to begin “fighting back with marches, rallies and town hall meetings.”

“So, with powerful hearts and pussies, we began the fight,” she writes. “We grabbed back. We realized the power of our collective voices and awakened a sleeping, feminist giant. She’s smart. She’s beautiful. She’s strong. She’s pissed.”

“Feminine power is boundless. Women can change the world. We already have…and we’re not giving up now. The march goes on.”

Milano was an early supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid. She’s spent much of her time on social media slamming Trump’s policies.

Robert Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, said Wednesday that ABC News has been “extremely fair” in its coverage of the 2016 election and the Trump administration and that complaints of left-wing political bias on ESPN are “completely exaggerated.”

Disney, which owns both ABC News and ESPN, held its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, where Iger responded to a question about the leftwing political bias at the networks by Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy Research.

Iger insisted that ABC News has been entirely on the level in its coverage of the 2016 campaign and President Trump. He said:

ABC News has reported to me, directly or indirectly, for almost 25 years. I’m an expert on ABC News, and I can stand here today, look you in the face, and say I’m proud of the efforts of ABC News. I respect ABC News, and I believe they work very, very hard to present news in an extremely fair way. There are always going to be people – yourself included and perhaps the president – who are going to believe that it is not being presented in a manner that’s consistent with their own beliefs. There’s an indictment made about the press simply because some of the press do not necessarily tow the line with positions being taken by others.

Danhof, whose organization buys stocks in firms so it can attend shareholder meetings and ask tough questions, pointed out that Iger sidestepped the toughest parts of his query on Wednesday. The CEO simply ignored the part of his question that dealt with George Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton White House aide and now ABC News personality.

Stephanopoulos was found in the Wikileaks hacks of the Democratic National Committee to have colluded with the Clinton campaign on story ideas, editing questions and lines of attack on Peter Schweizer, who wrote the book Clinton Cash a New York Times bestseller that detailed conflicts of interest and other misdealings by Bill and Hillary Clinton.

Danhof said of Iger:

How he lined up his response was telling. He wouldn’t address the question. He was sticking his head in the sand. His response was that I was making this up. But this has reached a nexus. Will his network continue to ignore or mock the millions of Americans in flyover country, or will we work to make his networks more inviting to other points of view? Right now, he’s saying he doesn’t want us as customers.

Iger was even more determined when it came to ESPN, the sports giant that has announced in recent days it plans another round of layoffs because of massive financial losses that some attribute to its sharp leftward ideological turn.

In his questioning, Danhof mentioned an exchange between two on-air personalities for the network about how, if they said, “Coming up, why Donald Trump is awesome,” they would “not last until the first commercial.”

Iger insisted the network exhibited no bias.

“The charge that ESPN is exhibiting significant political bias in its programming is just completely exaggerated,” Iger said. “One small communication and blowing it up into something that sounds a lot larger than it is. Watch ESPN and you’re not going to see political bias at ESPN.”

Critics say there is, in fact, a lot of bias at ESPN. They point to Caitlyn Jenner winning the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, the network’s endorsement of Black Lives Matter at the ESPY Awards, ESPN-W’s aggressive coverage of the Women’s March on Washington in January, and the firing of Doug Adler — a tennis commentator — after he referred to the “guerrilla effect” of Venus Williams moving closer to the net on second serves at the Australian Open.

There is also daily bias from commentators such as Michael Wilbon and Tony Kellerman. And then there is Kevin Blackstone, an African-American sportswriter who appears on ESPN talk programs and once referred to the Star Spangled Banner as a “war anthem.”

Curt Schilling, the former big league pitcher who was fired in April 2016 after he tweeted out support for the North Carolina law that required people to use the bathroom of their anatomical sex, scoffed at the notion ESPN is unbiased.

“We recognize Abby Wambach and her stance on the gay lifestyle in the sports world, but not Milo Yiannopoulos and his gay perspective as a victim of molestation,” Schilling said in an email to Breitbart News. “We recognize that every issue Stephen A. Smith has in sports is based on black and white, not talent. But we don’t recognize Ben Carson, a conservative man from the worst of the worst backgrounds who never allowed color to taint his world perspective.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab479655a:10d4c5b:b3a473c6</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Migrants covered by former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) continue making demands to President Donald Trump.

A group of DACA recipients gathered for a press conference in Connecticut, home to some 8,500 DACA recipients, to express that they were “here today to let everyone know we’re not going back in the shadows,” as Connecticut Students for a Dream co-founder Camila Bortoletto told WNPR.

“It’s a different time, it’s a tough time,” Bortoletto said. “It’s definitely a scarier time than we’ve had in the past.”

Another DACA recipient, Eric Cruz Lopez, complained that some ‘DREAMers,’ as the mainstream media has dubbed them, are being deported under Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

“DACA for a lot of undocumented immigrants meant relief, it meant protection, it meant something, it meant a win,” Lopez told the media. “But that doesn’t mean anything anymore, right? As we see DACA recipients being picked up, that two-year relief of deportation doesn’t mean anything to anybody anymore.”

Lopez is most likely referring to 23-year-old Daniel Ramirez Medina, who was a DACA recipient that was most recently arrested by the Immigration and Customs Agency (ICE) agency after they said he is a “self-admitted gang member.”

As Breitbart Texas reported, the mainstream media covered Medina’s arrest as a plight for other DACA recipients, failing to point out his alleged gang relations across the West Coast.

Connecticut’s DACA recipients are now telling others to not apply for the program until after there is clarity on the issue from the Trump Administration.

President Donald Trump and critics of the House plan to replace Obamacare met at the White House on Tuesday, allowing his team to make a case for the bill to skeptical conservative groups.

David McIntosh of Club for Growth, Jim DeMint of Heritage, Tim Phillips of Americans for Prosperity, Adam Brandon of FreedomWorks, Mike Needham of Heritage Action, and Jenny Beth Martin of Tea Party Patriots were all present for the meeting, according to the White House.

White House sources at the meeting speaking to CNN’s Jim Acosta said Trump appeared open to some changes to the bill to make it more appealing to conservatives.

“This is going to be great. You’re going to make it even greater,” Trump said to the groups, according to a source.

The White House appeared open to speeding up a rollback of the current Medicaid expansion to 2018 and delaying some of the changes to the insurance market, Politico said. But the tax credit subsidies for low-income Americans to help purchase health care do not appear to be open for negotiation.

It appears that Trump is not ready to kill the bill Speaker Paul Ryan proposed and put forward a new one, something that some conservatives have begged him to do.

According to Acosta, Trump cautioned conservatives to stop calling the bill “Obamacare Lite,” warning that they were helping Democrats.

But he signaled that if the bill failed, the administration would make Democrats own the impending healthcare crisis, according to Politico.

It’s not the first time that Trump has appeared open to letting Obamacare collapse on its own.

“So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in ’17, and believe me we’d get pretty much whatever we want but it would take a long time,” Trump said in January.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab479655a:10d4c59:b3a473c6</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Conflict emerged between protest groups demonstrating on International Women’s Day in downtown Santa Cruz, California on Wednesday, as a “Brown Squad” focused on racial issues faced off against a “less diverse” group of protesters.

The local Santa Cruz Sentinel described an “intense conflict” between the two protest groups, which it described as follows:

The protest’s two distinct groups clearly had different agendas. The first included roughly 75 younger protesters, mostly women of color, who marched down from UC Santa Cruz. This group’s messaging was focused on racism, white privilege, patriarchal oppression, as well as transgender and queer issues. The second group consisted of about 150 women and a few men dressed mostly in red who had been brought together by the Santa Cruz General Strike Organizing Committee. Older and less diverse, this group focused on issues primary to the larger International Women’s Day Strike — reserving most of its anger for the administration of President Donald Trump.

The “Brown Squad” was the more radical of the two, according to the Sentinel. It blocked traffic downtown, leading to a tense standoff with a pickup truck driver that was captured on YouTube:

At one point, a member of the “Brown Squad” delivered a speech to the “less diverse” group, exhorting it to address its own internal privilege, according to the Sentinel: ““Ally-ship means getting off your high horse and realizing that other people are suffering a lot more than you … To join those people over there you have to address the darkness within you.”

Footage, apparently of the two groups together, shows some demonstrators wearing masks, a protester carrying a Palestinian flag, and a speech railing against capitalism.

According to the Sentinel, the groups later splintered.

Protests were also held in other cities across the country, though they did not match the scale of protests on the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

President Donald Trump’s tougher border security and immigration enforcement plans have driven up human smuggling fees being charged by cartel-connected coyotes.

“We are seeing an increase in the fees charged by human smugglers along the U.S. southwest border,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John F. Kelly said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “Since Nov. 2016, ‘coyotes’ have hiked their fees in some areas by roughly 130 percent–from $3,500 to $8,000 in certain mountainous regions.”

Kelly attributed the increased fees charged to newly implemented changes in DHS policy regarding the detention of apprehended aliens.

“As directed in my memoranda implementing the President’s executive orders, we remain committed to carrying out fair, impartial and humane enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws,” Kelly wrote.

Coyotes have become dependent on human smuggling fees, often earning as much from smuggling people as drug runs. Breitbart Texas reported in the days before the November 2016 Election, cartel-connected smugglers were using the contest as a “marketing tool” to get people to travel in advance.

“The cartel uses what happens in the U.S. as a marketing tool in Central America,” McAllen Mayor Jim Darling said during an exclusive interview with Breitbart Texas. “The need is there (in Central America) but what happens in Washington and the way the news media presents it, they (cartels) say you better get up here. So that causes the surges. We”ll see what happens after the election to see if it slows down.”

After the election, it did not slow down. The months of November, December, and January, all saw increases in apprehensions compared to the same months in the prior year.

Following the release of December’s numbers showing a large increase in apprehensions, particularly in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marlene Castro said, “We’re not a deterrent because they’re looking for us, so we can be standing there and [the smuggler will] still send them across,” during an interview with Fox News Channel’s William La Jeunesse. “It’s been a group, and then maybe five minutes later another group, and then half an hour later you’ll see another one.”

With the swearing in of President Trump in January, the numbers finally began to subside. While still higher than January 2016, the numbers were down from December.

The first full month of the Trump Administration brought a dramatic drop in migrant apprehensions between ports of entry along the southwest border. Apprehensions not only dropped from January to February; they dropped to the lowest level of any month in the past five years.

“The drop in apprehensions shows a marked change in trends,” Secretary Kelly said. “Since the Administration’s implementation of Executive Orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years.”

“Since President Trump took office on January 20, we have seen a dramatic drop in numbers,” Kelly stated. “We will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between March and May. However, the early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact.”

“The decrease is also encouraging news because it means many fewer people are putting themselves and their families at risk of exploitation, assault, and injury by human traffickers and the physical dangers of the treacherous journey north,” the DHS secretary concluded.

The former papal spokesman has denied rumors that Pope Benedict XVI resigned under “tremendous pressures,” including from the Obama administration, asserting rather that he did so under his own volition.

In response to recent statements by Italian Archbishop Luigi Negri that suggested Benedict had resigned under significant duress, Father Federico Lombardi (pictured) said Thursday that the Pope Emeritus must be taken at his word when he said he had stepped down “in full freedom and responsibility.”

“There is no mystery to be revealed,” Lombardi said. “Benedict XVI is a man who put the truth first. How can someone so blatantly contradict what he said and then solemnly reaffirmed?”

In statements earlier this week, Archbishop Negri claimed that the Obama administration may have been complicit in the “tremendous pressures” that led the former pope to resign in 2013.

It is “no coincidence” that some Catholic groups “have asked President Trump to open a commission of inquiry to investigate whether the administration of Barack Obama exerted pressure on Benedict,” Negri said in an interview Monday, citing revelations by Wikileaks regarding efforts by the Democratic Party to influence the Catholic Church in the United States.

Father Lombardi, who was papal spokesman during the Benedict years, noted that the former pontiff offered a substantially different account of his resignation from the one offered by Negri, and he did so “publicly before the cardinals gathered in Consistory and the world” and again in an interview book with Peter Seewald titled Last Testament.

According to Father Lombardi, Negri’s comments have provoked questions and “unnecessary confusion.”

Negri, who claims to be Benedict’s “friend,” offers an odd demonstration of friendship in “triumphantly” contradicting what his friend has said, Lombardi observes.

“I do not think it is necessary to think of terrible pressures from overseas,” Lombardi states. “We can easily think that his was a very wise and sensible decision, before God and before men.”

“I believe that several of his successors will be grateful,” he said.

Thirty-one Democratic and Republican Senators are asking the Department of Homeland Security to maximize the use of blue-collar outsourcing visas so U.S. companies can import more foreign workers instead of recruiting, training and paying unskilled U.S. workers.

The bipartisan request comes three months after the shocking November vote pressured GOP leaders to slash the H-2B visa program from a one-year high of 264,000 visas back down to the long-standing level of 66,000 visas.

The request to Department of Homeland Security John Kelly also comes as a claimed shortage of H-2B is prompted recruiters to find, hire, train and retain some of the millions of young underemployed men and women who could fill the many low-status seasonal jobs in landscaping, golf course maintenance, cleanup in restaurants, seafood processing, and hotel cleaning which are often allocated to H-2B contract-workers.

Recruitment consultants are helping employers hire alternative workers from American trade schools and from Puerto Rico. They are also warning employers to raise salaries and benefits for U.S. workers or else lose the workers to better-paying companies. “The first thing all employees want is a decent wage … Do you pay a competitive wage? This is probably the first place to start,” one employer recently urged her fellow landscaping employers.

On March 6, North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announced a bipartisan Senate effort to increase the supply of H-2B visas, saying;

Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Mark Warner (D-VA) and a bipartisan group of 29 other senators sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, outlining concerns that the H-2B visa statutory cap will be reached soon. The Senators requested the Department of Homeland Security to conduct an audit to determine the number of unused visas during the first half of the fiscal year, and also requested that any unused visas be provided to eligible businesses that have been unable to secure an adequate number of workers due to the cap.

According to the statement,

In 2015, after previously announcing that the statutory cap had been reached, [the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency] determined that more than 5,000 unused visas were available. Soon thereafter, the agency began accepting applications from businesses still hoping to hire workers through the program. With that in mind, we respectfully request that your office conduct an immediate audit of the number of unused visas from the first half of the fiscal year and project the likely usage rate for the second half of the fiscal year … As with prior practice, any unused visas should be provided to eligible businesses that have been unable to secure an adequate number of workers due to the cap.

The estimate of 5,000 unused visas is based on the number of approved-but-unused 2015 visas. According to the letter:

We understand that when USCIS deems the cap to be reached, it accounts for a certain number of withdrawals, denials, and revocations. It is very important, however, that as soon as it has information on the actual number of visas issued, USCIS immediately makes any unused visas available to seasonal businesses.

The political request to recycle 5,000 allocated-but-unused visas is a long fall from the industry’s successful push in 2015 to effectively quadruple the H-2B visa program from 66,000 visas to 274,000 visas. House Speaker Paul Ryan backed the expansion in December 2015. Growing public and media criticism prompted Ryan to withdrew his support in 2016, so allowing the program to drop back down to 66,000 visas per year level.

The H-2B program is the blue-collar version of the H-1B visa outsourcing program, which allows a population of roughly 650,000 lower-wage foreign university graduates to take jobs sought by young American college grads. The H-1B program gets a lot of bad publicity, partly because it threatens the peers and children of influential middle-class professionals in the computer, academic, healthcare and business sectors, who also have ready access to sympathetic journalists.

Thirty-one Senators signed the letter to outsource the extra jobs. They include 10 Democrats and 21 Republicans:

Senators Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), John Cornyn (R-TX), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Chris Coons (D-DE), John Barrasso (R-WY), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Tom Carper (D-DE), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Patty Murray (D-WA), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Angus King (I-ME), Tim Scott (R-SC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Richard Burr (R-NC), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), James Lankford (R-OK), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Thad Cochran (R-MS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Bob Casey (D-PA).

The signers include Sen. Graham, who has a long history of aiding H-2B employers.

Tillis is also a long-standing supporter of cheap-labor visas. When serving as Speaker of the North Carolina House in 2013, he helped employers hire illegal immigrants by overriding a veto from GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. In 2017, Tillis is also pushing business-backed plans to increase the annual inflow of foreign contract-workers and to deliver an amnesty to at least 750,000 younger illegals.

Business groups are still pushing for an amnesty for illegals, and for a constant large-scale inflow of foreign workers to minimize the cost of hired workers in the United States, even though political support for those goals has crashed since the November election.

“Brave folks” are still willing to try, said Michele Stockwell, vice-president of public policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said at a March 2 meeting.

“We know most of the solutions, we have to figure out … how to silence the voices at either end of the political spectrum that are the reason we haven’t been successful in the past, and solve the problem,” Tillis told several business lobbyists at the March 2 meeting.

There is a “dark wall that we see now of [political] intransigence [and] your voice has brought some light,” former housing secretary Henry Cisneros told Tillis during a scripted conversation on March 2.

Tillis’ office did not respond to emails from Breitbart News.

Companies that want more H-2B workers plan to lobby legislators on March 14.

But without enough cheap foreign workers, employers are under growing pressure to raise wages and benefits for Americans. In January, Leslie Allebach, an employer in Palmyra Pa., offered some advice to her fellow employers, saying:

1. Would you be satisfied with the benefits your company provides? What benefits would you like to have in place if you were your employee? Of course, the first thing all employees want is a decent wage. They have bills and mortgages to pay and they’d sure like a little extra with which to enjoy life after these payments are made. Do you pay a competitive wage? This is probably the first place to start. 2. Make sure you have an IRA and a good plan for health insurance in place. If these two things are not available for faithful employees, it is time to get busy. These are extremely important to most employees and so they should be. To not offer these is to automatically subject yourself to losing your best employees and may even keep you from having potential employees consider your company in the first place… 3. All employees should be offered some vacation time. Your employees have families and personal lives. Sometimes we are tempted to think that a winter lay-off is enough vacation for them (for those of us who close down over winter), but this provides them no time for summer vacations or fall hunting. In our company, we ask our employees to avoid vacation days from March 15 through May 31.

Executives in the landscaping industry admit the public opposes the use of guest-workers.

Paul Mendelsohn, vice president government relations, National Association of Landscape Professionals, says President Donald Trump – who has hired guest workers through the H-2B program at his hotels and golf courses – and a new Congress could mean major changes either way on the program. “We received reassurances from Congress that they understand the importance (of H-2B),” he says. “Partially, as a result of the focus on immigration and anti-immigration that were heard during the election, there’s a lot of hesitancy by members of Congress to publicly take a position that’s related to immigration. “Even though publicly they’ll say it’s workforce, not immigration, their constituents see it otherwise.”

The federal government annually imports two new temporary or permanent foreign workers for every four young Americans who turn 18, which helps push millions of working-age American men and women out of the formal workforce. The flood of foreign labor also pushes many marginal U.S. workers toward social alienation, drug dependence, and death, and annually shifts roughly $500 billion from employees’ wallets to employers’ income. In November, Donald Trump won the presidency with a campaign to “Buy American, Hire American.”

An Italian archbishop close to Pope Benedict XVI has claimed that the Obama administration may have been complicit in the “tremendous pressures” that led the former pope to resign in 2013.

It is “no coincidence” that some Catholic groups “have asked President Trump to open a commission of inquiry to investigate whether the administration of Barack Obama exerted pressure on Benedict,” said Archbishop Luigi Negri in an interview Monday, citing other revelations by Wikileaks regarding efforts by the Democratic Party to sway the direction of the Catholic Church in the United States.

“It remains shrouded in mystery for now,” he said to news outlet Rimini 2.0, “but I am sure that those responsible will be found out.”

The archbishop was making reference to a letter written by a group of American Catholics to President Trump last January requesting that the administration conduct an investigation into a possible Soros-Obama-Clinton conspiracy behind the resignation of Pope Benedict.

The letter stated specifically that “we have reason to believe that a Vatican ‘regime change’ was engineered by the Obama administration.”

Approximately a year after an e-mail conversation released by Wikileaks, the authors contended, “we find that Pope Benedict XVI abdicated under highly unusual circumstances and was replaced by a pope whose apparent mission is to provide a spiritual component to the radical ideological agenda of the international left.”

In startling revelations last October, Clinton campaign chief John Podesta was found to have created phony “Catholic” organizations in order to use Church leaders to push a liberal agenda in congress and to promote the agenda of the Democratic Party.

In the midst of the hundreds of John Podesta’s emails released by Wikileaks, one contained a report by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, a faux Catholic association founded by Podesta to provoke a revolution in the Catholic Church.

The executive director of the organization, Christopher J. Hale, referred to the group’s “grueling preparation for Pope Francis’s apostolic trip to the US.”

Along with efforts to infiltrate the Church hierarchy, the organization’s collusion with the Obama administration was also made apparent in Hale’s report.

“I spoke to the White House yesterday and they assure us the media’s moniker calling us ‘God Squad’ isn’t just sweet nothings, but actually a fair assessment of the substantial difference we’re making in this conversation,” he wrote.

Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput described a meeting with two members of the other “Catholic” organization that Podesta claims to have founded—Catholics United. In a published essay, the archbishop depicted a methodology eerily similar to that employed by Catholics in Alliance.

Chaput said that the two men were “obvious flacks for the Obama campaign and the Democratic Party—creatures of a political machine, not men of the Church,” who showed remarkable “talents of servile partisan hustling.”

In a separate statement, the head of the U.S. Bishops Conference, Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz, issued an indictment of the Clinton team, calling them out for interfering in the Church’s self-governance for “short-term political gain.”

Kurtz suggested that Podesta’s actions in creating “Catholic” lobby groups for the Democratic Party constituted a breach of religious freedom, “one of the founding principles of our republic,” which ensures the right of faith communities to “preserve the integrity of their beliefs and proper self-governance.”

In his interview Monday, Archbishop Negri said he has visited Pope Benedict “several times” since the pontiff’s resignation in 2013. Negri resigned last month as archbishop of Ferrara-Comacchio, a post assigned him by Pope Benedict, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

Archbishop Negri did not lay all the blame for Benedict’s resignation on the Obama administration, but said he was “certain that the truth will emerge one day showing grave liability both inside and outside the Vatican.”

In the interview, Negri was also critical of Pope Francis for failing to answer the dubia—or “questions”—made by four Cardinals regarding certain teachings in the Pope’s letter Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love) that seem unclear to many in the Church.

“Amoris Laetitia needs clarification, unfortunately, the current leader of the Church still remains silent,” he said. “I think that the Holy Father should respond, although he seems to have decided to the contrary.”

Both versions of President Trump’s executive order have been caricatured as a “Muslim ban,” even though they applied to only six or seven specific countries, leaving 90 percent of the world’s population out of the mix.

The fallback euphemism is to say that Trump is “banning” immigration (they never say it is conditional and temporary) from several “Muslim-majority” countries. This is also misleading because those countries are not merely inhabited by a majority of Muslims. They are Muslim countries, period. They all have some form of Islamic law written into their legal codes.

With Iraq removed from the equation, the remaining nations affected by the order are Iran, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, and Somalia. The original executive order did not list the affected nations; it merely referred to Obama-era legislation that named them as nations of particular concern. The revised version of the order does name the affected nations because it explains why each of them is on the list.

The first version of the order did not mention Islam at all. The revised version does, but only to explain why the first order did not because this is not a “Muslim ban”:

Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities — whoever they are and wherever they reside — to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.

Islam is not a “minority religion” in any of the six countries named by the order. In fact, all six of them officially incorporate Islamic sharia law into their legal codes.

Of the six, Iran is an outright Islamic theocracy. Its Supreme Leader is the Ayatollah, a top-ranking Muslim cleric. Iran’s legal code is explicitly based on sharia, with a smattering of civil ordinances thrown in. Iranian courts have been known to invoke sharia for such judgments as requiring a woman to be blinded in retribution for throwing acid in a victim’s face.

Iranian law nominally has some protections for religious minorities, but the absolute supremacy of Islam is not questioned. Observers have reported that religious freedom is growing steadily worse in the theocracy.

Libya is the most complex of the six nations to classify, because it does not have a functioning central government at all, following Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton’s disastrous intervention – a fact the mainstream media prefers not to dwell on. “Libya’s post-revolution legal system is in flux and driven by state and non-state entities,” as the CIA World Factbook tactfully puts it.

The capital city of Tripoli was seized by an Islamist coalition, with the Muslim Brotherhood a major player. Another is Ansar al-Sharia, a Salafist Islamic militia. The presence of “sharia” in its name is not a coincidence; they declared Libya an Islamic “caliphate” in 2014.

There has been success in the battle against Libyan ISIS, but al-Qaeda is still a major player. U.N.-backed unity governments tend to include a lot of people from the more extreme wings of Libyan politics. They have to because Islamists are a powerful political force in the country.

Another major force in chaotic Libya is widely described as a “secularist,” General Khalifa Haftar. Some observers wonder just how “secularist” he really is, especially if he gains control of the country and has to make deals with the powerful Islamist elements he is currently fighting.

Haftar is an old Qaddafi hand, and while the late dictator is remembered as a brutal and mercurial secularist loathed by hardline Islamists in Libya, he was sometimes given to Islamist sentiments of his own. For instance, Qaddafi once declared Islam was the only universal human religion and said, “all those believers who do not follow Islam are losers.” He named his son and once-presumed successor Saif al-Islam.

Libya’s future is a question mark, but it is highly disingenuous to describe even its present state as merely “Muslim-majority.” The interim Libyan constitution of 2011 begins with the invocation of “Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate,” states that Islam is the official religion of the country, and declares “sharia shall be the main source of legislation.” Until and unless a different constitution is put into effect by an internationally-recognized national government, Libya is a Muslim nation.

Somalia officially imposed sharia law through its Cabinet in 2009. “Islamic Sharia is the only option to get solutions for the problems in this country,” one minister declared. Less than 0.1% of the population follows a religion other than Islam.

The Somali government banned Christmas celebrations in December 2015, because “having Muslims celebrate Christmas is not the right thing,” as a top official put it. He likened Christmas celebrations to apostasy and said they are “not in any way related to Islam.” Foreigners were graciously allowed to celebrate Christmas in their homes, but even hotels were instructed to prevent guests from holding celebrations.

The al-Shabaab terrorist organization thinks the central government is not Islamist enough and imposes an even harsher sharia code on the sizable portions of the country it effectively controls. Many of the people living under al-Shabaab control have told interviewers they support its legal code.

Sudan is officially an Islamic state with a sharia legal code. Even the leaders of breakaway South Sudan, which want to return to a common-law system on the British model, have been struggling to purge sharia from the legal system.

Sudan, like Somalia, is not “majority Muslim” – it is about 96% Muslim, and the 3% Christian minority is brutally persecuted, despite some nominal legal protection for other religions. World Atlas notes that “some interpretations of the Muslim Law in the country fail to recognize or accept apostasy and marriages to non-Muslims,” and concludes that “Sudan leads the world as the most difficult country for Christians since freedom of religion or belief is systematically ignored.”

Syria is an uncomfortable case, as some religious minorities say they fared much better under the Assad dictatorship. Some Syrian Christians bluntly refer to Bashar Assad as their “protector” and have similar hopes for the intervening Russians. Of course, critics of the brutal Syrian regime argue that Assad’s alliance with Christians is purely cynical, and even accuse him of inflaming the Christian fear of Muslims for political gain.

Assad’s government is nominally secular, while even most of the “good guy” rebels supported by Western powers practice Islamic law through sharia courts. Syrians in contested areas complain that different sharia courts loyal to various factions, from “moderates” to hardcore al-Qaeda Islamists, issue conflicting verdicts.

At the height of the rebellion, many Syrians expressed a desire to replace the Syrian Arab Republic with an Islamic state. Then they found themselves saddled with the Islamic State, which may have led some of them to reconsider. However, there are still calls to impose sharia across Syria, portraying it as an instrument of peace and justice.

Having said that, the constitution of the “secular” Syrian Arab Republic explicitly requires the president to be a Muslim, and requires that “Islamic jurisprudence shall be a major source of legislation.” This was true of both the older constitution and the revised document prepared in 2012.

The same article declares “the State shall respect all religions, and ensure the freedom to perform all the rituals that do not prejudice public order,” but there is no question: Syria is a Muslim nation, not a “Muslim-majority nation.” Islam enjoys a privileged position in its legal code that Western liberals would not tolerate without comment from any other religion.

Yemen practices a mixture of sharia law and common law in what passes for its central government – which, of course, was overthrown by the Houthis, a Shiite Muslim insurgency supported by the Iranian theocracy. The internationally recognized Yemeni government has said the Houthis want to transform Yemen into a caliphate ruled by lineal descendants of Mohammed.

Even Houthi spokesmen who strongly disagree with that characterization have said they think “sharia should be one of the main sources of the law in Yemen, not the only source.”

The large portions of Yemen controlled by al-Qaeda are noted for the strict rule of Islamic law, including the oppression of women. Al-Qaeda regards the failure to strictly obey sharia as “debauchery.”

The Constitution of the Republic of Yemen explicitly declares it to be an Islamic state, and stipulates “sharia is the source of all legislation.” Islam is unambiguously named as the official state religion. Denouncing Islam is a crime punishable by death. Over 99% of the population is Muslim.

Iraq: Even though it is no longer listed in Trump’s executive order, it should be noted that Iraq is an explicitly Islamic nation, according to its 2005 constitution. “Islam is the official religion of the State and is a fundamental source of legislation,” Article 2 declares. “No law that contradicts the established provisions of Islam may be established.”

Religious freedom is nominally protected, as long as the supremacy of Islam is acknowledged by all: “This Constitution guarantees the Islamic identity of the majority of the Iraqi people and guarantees the full religious rights of all individuals to freedom of religious belief and practice such as Christians, Yazedis, and Mandi Sabeans.”

Some Iraqi clerics agitate for stricter adherence to sharia law, which introduces the dangerous question of whether Sunni or Shiite law should reign supreme.

The incorporation of Sharia law into the legal codes of these countries occurs to a degree that would revolt the American Left, if any religion except Islam was involved. Rest assured that no one in today’s mainstream media would describe, say, 15th-century Spain as a “majority Catholic” nation.

For that matter, they do not seem inclined to describe Israel as “majority Jewish”; they simply refer to it as a “Jewish state.” Israel is, in fact, only about 75% Jewish. A recent effort supported by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party to formally define Israel as a Jewish state failed, in part due to concerns that it could lead to discriminatory policies against the Arab population.

Its legal code includes extensive protection for religious minorities, and there are Muslim and Druze members of its parliament. Last November, one of them staged the Muslim call to prayer during a parliamentary session to protest a bill that would prevent all places of worship from using loudspeakers to summon their worshipers, because it was seen as unfairly targeting mosques.

Equivalent stunts are unwise for members of religious minorities in “Muslim-majority nations,” including the six listed in President Trump’s executive order.

In conclusion: all of the nations mentioned in both versions of President Trump’s executive order are Muslim countries, period.

Once again bypassing the hopelessly jaundiced media, President Trump announced that he just learned that his predecessor in the White House bugged Trump Tower during the last election.

“This is McCarthyism!” he declared, in 140 characters or less.

All the digits fit to print!

“Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wiretapping’ a race for president prior to an election?” Mr. Trump wondered, very loudly. “Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!”

“I bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!”

Ever litigious and meticulous about any slight, Mr. Trump is always on the march for justice.

“How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!”

Cue total media freakout.

But the usual conspiracy-minded folks in the media were suddenly and uncharacteristically uncurious about this latest case of alleged Watergate-style political buggery.

No proof, they exclaimed! Reckless accusations! Unfounded charges!

There is, to be clear, an unchallenged story written a few months back claiming that the Obama administration sought authorization from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to spy on Trump Tower as part of an investigation into links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. This request was initially denied, according to the story, before it was ultimately granted.

Now this, alone, is a stunning charge. The assertion that one sitting branch of the federal government used American intelligence operatives to spy on the campaign of a political enemy in the midst of a presidential campaign would, normally, be an explosive story that the media could never resist.

But these are not normal times.

Mr. Obama, the hounds bay, would NEVER order agents to spy on a political opponent. Anyway, his Justice Department would have to go through the FISA court to get permission to do it.

So, basically, the evidence for why this is all such a suddenly bogus claim is that Mr. Obama would never do it.

Yet, this is the same Barack Obama who spent eight years in the White House politicizing every imaginable aspect of the federal government in order to punish his enemies and reward his friends.

The massive stimulus program turned into a boondoggle for his friends in the environmental jihad. His IRS became weaponized to go after political enemies.

Mr. Obama’s Justice Department went so far pushing a political agenda against lawful gun ownership that they put thousands of illegal guns into the hands of criminals. Even after it was revealed that these guns were used to kill a U.S. Border Patrol agent, the Obama administration was unrepentant.

This is the same Barack Obama who ordered the federal government to take over the entire healthcare industry — one-sixth of the U.S. economy — in a brazen attempt to advance his own partisan, political agenda.

This guy is so overtly and nakedly political that he spent every ounce of his political capital during his presidency to turn community policing into a political agenda. Remember, only Black Lives Matter.

Even race could not escape the clutches of his political maw. “You know, if I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” Mr. Obama once said. Barf.

Now we read reports in The New York Times that the Obama administration left “bread crumbs” in hopes of trying the Trump campaign to the Russians after Mr. Obama left office. And U.S. intelligence agents spied on Mr. Trump’s national security adviser and leaked the results of that spying.

And you expect the American people now to believe that Mr. Obama didn’t bug Trump Tower because, well, that would just be too political? As Mr. Obama’s old Chicago preacher once famously said: “America’s chickens are coming home to roost.”

Samsung announced an investment in expanding production in the United States this week, according to The Wall Street Journal.

According to sources close to the company, the initial capital investment will total close to $300 million and will involve shifting some production from Mexico to the United States. The sources claim that the move could generate around 500 jobs.

Samsung, which is based in Seoul, South Korea, may increase manufacturing of home appliances such as refrigerators, washer, and dryers in the United States. According to The Wall Street Journal, the decision to move production to the United States was influenced by President Trump after he campaigned to move manufacturing jobs for products bought in the United States from overseas into this country.

The tech giant has engaged in initial discussions with several states, including Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina. According to the sources, South Carolina is likely one of the strongest contenders for a Samsung manufacturing plant, which could specifically be located in Blythewood, S.C.

Samsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong attended a meeting in December at Trump Tower with the then president-elect. Since that time, several large firms based in Asia have agreed to expand operations or invested into the United States.

Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, a hardline conservative who nearly toppled Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) in the 2014 midterm primaries, told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday evening he is considering launching another bid for the U.S. Senate in 2018.

This new bid would come against Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), a different but similar U.S. Senator from the Magnolia State, amid concerns over House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0 plan, the “American Health Care Act.”

McDaniel told Breitbart News:

I am definitely considering another run for U.S. Senate, for precisely the reason that now is the time when Mississippi’s conservatives should be leading the nation in the fight against Obamacare. Rather than championing conservative reform in D.C., Mississippi’s federal delegation — and Roger Wicker in particular — has been silent. Mississippians are among the most conservative people in the republic. We shouldn’t have to beg our Senators to fight for us.

Wicker has until now remained publicly silent on the bill from Ryan and House GOP leaders, even though Ryan’s legislation does not repeal Obamacare, keeps in place the individual mandate but shifts the recipient of the penalty payment from a tax collected by the government to a fee collected by insurance companies, keeps the Obamacare Cadillac Tax in place indefinitely—among many other serious concerns.

Republicans party-wide are rising up against it, from the House Freedom Caucus to Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Mike Lee (R-UT). Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who does not support the concept, says it does not have enough support to pass the Senate—and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), a moderate, says it will not pass the Senate either and that it is dead on arrival should it even reach that chamber. But it is unlikely to get there. The House Freedom Caucus, aides say, is united against the bill, and that is more than enough members to crush it.

But many House Republicans outside the House Freedom Caucus are also against the legislation, their offices tell Breitbart News, with as many as “70 or more” Republicans against Ryan’s bill, according to one aide. Paul told Breitbart News in a recent interview that Ryan appears to be misleading the president when it comes to this bill’s realistic chances in the House–and that it really does appear this bill will fail.

An aide in Wicker’s Senate office, Ryan Taylor, told Breitbart News that Wicker suports Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0 legislation even though it does not repeal Obamacare. He claimed inaccurately in his statement to Breitbart News that the bill does repeal Obamacare. Taylor also attempted to blame President Trump for the proposal, stating inaccurately that it was “the President’s proposal,” not Ryan’s bill.

“Sen. Wicker is working with President Trump, Vice President Pence, and most Republicans to pass the President’s proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare,” Taylor said, providing—when Breitbart News offered him an opportunity to amend that part of his statement and his claim the bill repeals Obamacare—a screenshot of President Trump’s Tweet announcing that Ryan rolled out the bill and that it is up “for review and negotiation.”

“Sen. Wicker is running for re-election and has a campaign manager,” Taylor added, connecting Breitbart News with that campaign manager, Justin Brasell.

“Senator Wicker is taking nothing for granted in his re-election campaign,” Brasell said in a statement. “He has hired a campaign manager, is actively working to raise money and is organizing grassroots support in all 82 counties. He will be ready to once again earn the support of Mississippi voters in 2018, regardless of who runs.”

McDaniel has proven he can win a statewide U.S. Senate race in Mississippi. Back in 2014, McDaniel won more votes than Cochran in the primary, but since both finished under 50 percent plus one vote, it was kicked to a runoff election. In the runoff, McDaniel won more Republican votes than Cochran. And Cochran only won because of a well-funded effort to get Democrats to cross over to vote in an underhanded way in the GOP primary.

McDaniel was endorsed, too, by now-President Donald Trump. Of McDaniel, Trump said, he “is strong, he is smart &amp; he wants things to change in Washington.”

I hope voters in Mississippi cast their ballot for @senatormcdaniel. He is strong, he is smart &amp; he wants things to change in Washington. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2014

In response to President Trump’s endorsement of McDaniel for U.S. Senate back in 2014, Brasell told Breitbart News that “this is a different race” and “Senator Wicker works well with President Trump.”

When Brasell was pressed on why, then, Wicker is not supporting efforts to repeal Obamacare, he told Breitbart News: “He is working with President Trump to repeal and replace Obamacare.” But since the only bill that Wicker’s team is publicly supporting right now on this matter is a bill that does not repeal Obamacare, the American Health Care Act—or Obamacare 2.0 from Paul Ryan—Breitbart News asked Brasell in a follow-up question what specific legislation other than that bill he is backing that repeals Obamacare. He has not answered.

The more important implication than this McDaniel news out of Mississippi, however, is that Ryan’s failure here to deliver a healthcare bill that actually does repeal Obamacare may unleash a wave of primary challenges against incumbent Republicans nationwide in both the House and Senate in 2018. With Republicans in the majority in both the House and Senate, and with a Republican president, a primary challenge wave is the last thing anyone in the Republican Party wants. But Ryan may have just triggered it.</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab15a1f23:a1df04:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

New information released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection reveals border apprehensions dropped in February to the lowest point in more than five years. Total apprehensions declined for the second straight month. These numbers cover the first full month since President Donald Trump was sworn in on January 20.

A total of 23,589 illegal immigrants were apprehended in February by Border Patrol agents between the ports of entry, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas. The numbers represent a decline of 18,915 from January and 14,727 from February 2016.

The apprehension of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) dropped by nearly 60 percent to 1,922 while Family Unit Alien (FMUA) apprehensions dropped by two-thirds to 3,124.

“The drop in apprehensions shows a marked change in trends,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary (DHS) John F. Kelly said in a written statement. “Since the Administration’s implementation of Executive Orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years.”

Officials said the numbers are even more impressive when you realize the trend line normally increases from January to February. “Instead, this year we saw a drop from 31,578 to 18,762 persons – a 40 percent decline,” Kelly explained.

In the three months leading up to President Trump’s inauguration, CBP officials reported dramatically increasing numbers of apprehensions in all categories. Officials reported a 35 percent increase in apprehensions during the first four months of the fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year. FMUA apprehensions increased more than 1oo percent, officials stated.

“However, since President Trump took office on January 20, we have seen a dramatic drop in numbers,” the DHS secretary stated.

“As directed in my memoranda implementing the President’s executive orders,” Secretary Kelly concluded, “we remain committed to carrying out fair, impartial and humane enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws. We will remain vigilant to respond to any changes in these trends, as numbers of illegal crossings typically increase between March and May. However, the early results show that enforcement matters, deterrence matters, and that comprehensive immigration enforcement can make an impact.”

HOUSTON, Texas – Law enforcement officials in Harris County released the identity of the 15-year-old girl found murdered in southwest Houston last month. Two illegal aliens who are members of the MS-13 transnational criminal gang are accused of killing the girl as part of a satanic ritual.

Officials identified the girl as 15-year-old Genesis Cornejo-Alvarado from the Houston suburb of Jersey Village, a local newspaper reported. The mother of the girl previously stated she believed her missing daughter had been killed by the two men, Breitbart Texas reported on Sunday. Genesis disappeared in mid-January, the mother stated.

Over a period of several weeks, Diego Rivera, 18, and Miguel Alvarez-Flores, 18, allegedly kidnapped and raped at least two young girls, Breitbart Texas reported on Thursday. Following an incident where one of the girls “disrespected” a satanic shrine in the apartment of one of the men, Rivera and Alvarez-Flores took her to a road in southwest Houston where they shot and killed her; prosecutors told the court. Authorities confirmed the victim is the missing girl, Genesis Cornejo-Alvarado.

The two MS-13 gang members from El Salvador held the surviving victim against her will, moving from one apartment to another while keeping her intoxicated with drugs and alcohol. She said the men held her down and tattooed the “Grim Reaper” along the entire length of her calf, prosecutors told the court.

Court records state a man going by the name “Flaco” sexually assaulted the 14-year-old victim.

As many as six MS-13 gang members lived in the apartment where the satanic rituals took place. Officials have not reported if more arrests are pending.

A SWAT team arrested the two gang members after a standoff on Monday. Officials did not disclose what led them to the location. The 14-year-old victim and another teenage girl were rescued and returned to their homes, the Daily Mail reported.

These are the types of criminal aliens President Trump is using immigration officers to round up and remove from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers carried out targeted operations in February designed to arrest criminal aliens across the country, Breitbart Texas reported. The operation led to the arrest of nearly 700 criminal aliens, including 44 in Austin, Texas, alone.

The operation led to a flurry of fake news reports and false information being spread about the intent of the operation.

Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly responded to the fake news attacks stating, “ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years. The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE’s Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis.”

The Mexican government is also pushing back against the new administration’s efforts to remove criminal aliens with a program to fund legal support services for those unlawfully present across the country. “What changes today is that we are prioritizing legal matters over everything. Previously, we didn’t have the need to seek so much legal support for our people,” Miami’s Consul General Antonio Zabalgoitia told the Associated Press on Friday. “But now, we need to protect them against an eventual deportation.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a top conservative in the U.S. Senate, unloaded on House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0 replacement plan—that does not repeal Obamacare—in an exclusive interview on Wednesday with Breitbart News.

In the interview, Paul accused Ryan of misleading President Donald Trump on the process and the level of support in the House for the bill that House GOP leadership—at Ryan’s direction—put forward this week.

The House Freedom Caucus was publicly against this strategy before Ryan even rolled it out. The group of more than 40 House conservatives remains steadfastly opposed to Ryan’s plan on this front, showing no signs of breaking as they signaled before it was introduced, and now many Republican offices outside the House Freedom Caucus privately tell Breitbart News that as many as 70 or more House Republicans are opposed to Ryan’s plan.

Leadership knows this too, they say, as all the “hard no” votes have told the Speaker’s office or the whip teams they cannot vote for this bill. But Ryan is plowing forward, stating at a number of press conferences this week he is confident he will receive the 218 votes he needs to pass the bill—even though he clearly does not have them right now.

When asked what Ryan’s strategy is here, Paul told Breitbart News it makes no sense—and that he believes that the Speaker is deliberately misleading President Trump into thinking he has more support for this bill than he has, and that its fate is not in crisis.

Paul is confident that conservative House and Senate Republicans will stick together, defeat this bill, and then work with President Trump to separate repeal and replacement into different bills passed on the same day down the road. The fact that Paul is saying Ryan is misleading Trump is an explosive charge, but is backed by the evidence of widespread mistrust in the House GOP conference over this bill and Ryan’s waning influence as Speaker—dislike of it extends far beyond the House Freedom Caucus, as Breitbart News can confirm.

Paul told Breitbart News:

I don’t think it makes any sense and I think he’s trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the president. I think when I’ve spoken with president Trump, I think he agrees with me that we should repeal and replace but I don’t think he’s stuck on that they have to be in the same bill necessarily. Paul Ryan, I think, is selling it to the White House and telling the White House, ‘Oh, it’s a piece of cake, it’s a done deal.’ And I don’t think that’s an accurate depiction of things. I think from the very beginning combining repeal and replace in one bill makes it very hard because we have different ideas on replace. We are pretty much united on repeal, but we have different ideas on replace. If the House leadership had come forward and talked to conservatives beforehand, I think they would have found out there is a lot of disagreement and they would have just passed what we already passed—what everybody voted for—and we also have a debate on the same day on a variety of replacement strategies. We still could do that. And I think if the House Freedom Caucus and the Senate conservatives stay together, I still think that that’s one possible outcome. It would be better for all of us if we separated it out with clean repeal and had replacement as a separate bill.

A senior congressional aide in a House Republican office whose member is not part of the House Freedom Caucus told Breitbart News his boss is also opposed to Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0, and that there is much more widespread Republican opposition to Ryan’s plan than leadership originally expected.

“I think you’re looking at 60 to 70 noes right now on the floor,” the aide told Breitbart News. “The phone lines have been blowing up with opposition to what they’re calling Ryan-Care. This is a hell of a Mexican standoff—it’s Freedom Caucus versus Trump, and Ryan who I think is driving the process. Who blinks here? It’s bigger than the Freedom Caucus but the Freedom Caucus has planted their flag on this one. Who’s going to blink first?”

A second GOP congressional aide in another non-House Freedom Caucus office told Breitbart News their boss is against it as well, and that Ryan has “way more than 70 not with him.” These two offices and others that are not part of the Freedom Caucus but are opposed to the legislation told Breitbart News that the only reason they are not publicly coming out against the bill is because they do not wish to create more chaos around this legislation. If Ryan keeps doubling down, and forcing a vote on this, it will get worse, they say.

A staffer in a third GOP office with a member not in the Freedom Caucus but opposed to the legislation even said staff is keeping the member off television to avoid getting connected to Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0. These numbers show that the Speaker has a serious problem inside his conference and has not thought this through.

Paul opened his exclusive interview in his U.S. Senate office in the Russell Senate Office Building by explaining exactly what is wrong with Ryan’s Obamacare bill, a bill he calls “Obamacare Lite.” He said there are four major reasons that Ryan’s bill is wrong; specifically that it creates an entitlement program, that it does not effectively handle Obamacare taxes and even keeps the Cadillac Tax indefinitely, the keeping of Obamacare’s individual mandate, and the keeping of Obamacare’s risk corridors—but simply renaming them.

Paul told Breitbart News:

I think the reason why the House leadership bill is Obamacare Lite is because it retains subsidies. Obamacare had subsidies for people to buy insurance. In the Paul Ryan bill, they keep the subsidies—they just call them refundable tax credits. Some people are predicting that it’s actually going to be more expensive than the subsidies we have under Obamacare. This isn’t you getting your own money back, this is you getting somebody else’s money. So, a family that makes $30,000 a year could actually get $14,000 that they didn’t pay. Let’s say they paid zero in income tax, they could get $14,000 back. One, we don’t have the money—it’s a new entitlement program and two, if you get $14,000 back do you think the insurance company is ever going to sell insurance for less than $14,000? That becomes the floor. So, it actually pushes insurance rates up—it doesn’t allow insurance rates to fall. So, that doesn’t allow insurance rates to fall and it sets up a new entitlement. The second thing that Paul Ryan’s Obamacare Lite bill does is they keep the Obamacare taxes—all of them—for a year. And then after a year, they keep the Cadillac Tax forever. That’s the tax on if you have really good insurance, Obamacare taxes that. So will Paul Ryan’s plan. The third thing they do that is Obamacare-like is they keep the individual mandate. It seems like every Republican says they were against the individual mandate. That’s if you didn’t buy insurance you had to pay a penalty to the government, a tax. Obamacare Lite, Paul Ryan’s plan, just changes it so you have to pay a penalty to the insurance companies. I consider that to still be a mandate that isn’t consistent with those of us who want less government involvement. So they keep the subsidies, they keep the taxes, and then they keep the mandate. Then the fourth thing they do is they actually subsidize the insurance companies. Right now, insurance companies are losing money and Obamacare has this rescue thing called ‘risk corridors’ to bail out the insurance companies. Paul Ryan has got the same thing, he just calls it reinsurance and it’s $100 million worth. I predict that might not even be enough. So I don’t like any of it. Now, I do think we agree as Republicans on repeal. But I don’t think we agree on the replacement. That’s why I say we should separate them, vote on repeal and then vote the same day on a separate bill that’s called replace.

Paul specifically told Breitbart News more about the argument that Ryan’s bill creates an additional entitlement program. He said that, while the House GOP leadership calls it a “refundable tax credit,” it functions in much the same way as Obamacare’s subsidies. Paul said:

It’s called a refundable tax credit and I think it’s the same as subsidies. What it is is if you pay nothing in income tax, when you get to the end of the year and you didn’t owe anything in income tax, you can get up to $14,000 back from the government. But the government doesn’t have any money. So it’s just like Obamacare, they put the subsidies at the federal government level. We’re actually $20 trillion in debt, we’re running a $500 billion deficit, we borrow a million dollars a minute. We don’t have any money to give anybody. So even if everybody said ‘oh we have to give people money and we should keep the Medicaid expansion and all that,’ someone should be honest about it and find where is the money going to come from. So, for example, that’s one of my complaints about Obamacare in general is that it’s a dishonest accounting. They said poor people need help. I agree. I want to help them by lowering the price of their insurance. But they said ‘no, no we want to give them dollars for Medicaid expansion and to buy insurance with subsidies.’ The problem is there is no money to give them so we just add to the deficit. The main thing driving the deficit up here are the entitlements. So I think Paul Ryan’s refundable tax credits are just a new entitlement program.

Paul also said he believes the concern—confirmed by Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA), a proponent of Obamacare 2.0, on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight on Tuesday evening—that illegal aliens will have access to Medicaid funds under Ryan’s bill is in fact a “valid concern.”

“I think that is a concern—a valid concern,” Paul told Breitbart News. “And I don’t think illegal immigrants—nor do I think we should be admitting people and putting them on welfare. We have enough poor people in our country without importing more people from around the world onto welfare.”

When asked if it is too late for Ryan to withdraw this bill and approach repealing and replacing Obamacare in a manner Republicans campaigned on for years, rather than in this convoluted way, Paul said: “No, I don’t think so.” And Paul believes that President Trump will be willing to bargain, given the fact that Ryan’s bill is unlikely to pass either chamber of Congress, according to many Republicans party-wide.

“President Trump has indicated look, his career in business has been about negotiating deals,” Paul said. “My guess is he realizes this is going to take some negotiation. He seems to be very open to hearing from conservatives. He’s been inviting my input and I’m aware he’s been inviting input from different members of the House Freedom Caucus as well.”

Paul also said that the goal here is not to kill any person’s bill or stop repeal of Obamacare—and that Ryan’s recklessness jeopardizes GOP chances to repeal and replace Obamacare. “The goal is to get one that passes,” Paul said. “I think they’re going in the wrong direction, but I think a clean repeal could pass again.”

When asked if President Trump is more open to the withdrawing of the leadership bill for his suggested approach to repealing and replacing Obamacare, Paul told Breitbart News: “I think so.” If Trump begins listening to conservatives, he argues, then he believes the president will change course and drop Ryan’s bill for one that has a better chance at success. Paul added:

I think what has to happen, and this is just beginning is that conservatives need to get in front of the president. So far it’s been leadership, which are mostly the establishment Republicans. I just think he needs to hear from some conservatives and he will realize there are many different issues. I think he does realize there are many different issues and many different factions out there. It’s complicated. You got to get them all on one page for one bill. It happened 14 months ago, we all voted for clean repeal. So I think there’s at least some evidence people will vote for a clean repeal bill.

Paul said that Republicans should pass a clean repeal bill and a replacement bill all on the same day, but he does not believe Ryan’s vision for Obamacare replacement is one that can gain widespread support inside the Republican Party.

“Everybody wants repeal and that’s what I keep telling people,” Paul said. “We’re united on repeal, we’re just not united on the replacement part. To me, it makes evidently good sense to divide them, because I don’t think we’re coming to an agreement. If Paul Ryan were sitting right here with us, I don’t think we’d have an agreement on replace, nor do I think we will, because his ideas are Obamacare Lite and conservatives in this country just aren’t for that.”

Trump is reportedly heading to Kentucky this weekend as part of what seems to be a feckless effort to pressure Paul into backing down. It comes after Trump Tweeted at Paul on Tuesday evening.

I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2017

While Paul said he welcomes the president to Kentucky if he is indeed headed there, and that he supports the president on a number of fronts, he will not back down when it comes to battling Obamacare and fighting to repeal and replace the healthcare law.

Paul told Breitbart News:

We welcome the president to Kentucky. He’s very popular in Kentucky. And one of the reasons he’s very popular is he has said he will fight for the families who work in the coal mines. The first regulation we repealed was something that would have hurt our coal miners even more and I went to the White House and supported the president on that. I’ve supported the president on the overwhelmingly conservative cabinet that he’s put forward. I’ve supported the president on really, virtually every issue so far so I think we actually have a good relationship and I think there’s a possibility for continued negotiation with him.

The grassroots Americans who propelled Trump into the White House after electing Paul to the U.S. Senate in 2010 and again in 2016—as well as powering GOP majorities in the House and Senate—are with him and the conservatives, Paul said. The grassroots nationwide are not with Ryan and the leadership plan. He went on to say:

I think this is big, and I think it becomes bigger over time as the more people hear about it and the more people begin to talk about it. When the Tea Party movement started back in 2009, we had hundreds of thousands of people showing up mostly unhappy with Obamacare. When they find out that the House leadership wants to keep part of Obamacare, they’re going to be livid. So every day they’re hearing about it and every day I think the voice is going to become stronger. But I still think there’s common ground. I think Republicans by and large have been for repeal. Let’s just do a repeal bill.”

And Paul is slightly shocked that Republicans have not thought this through more clearly when they have had seven years to get here. He said, “Some of us did think we had a thought through strategy because we voted on it 14 months ago. We thought we were going to get the same thing. And I think it would have been very easy for leadership on both sides—House and Senate—alright guys, men and women, we voted on this once and we’re going to do it again. Then we’ll come up with ideas for replacement strategies. I think in some ways they just got a little bit ahead of themselves by thinking ‘oh, we’ll just stick all these replacement ideas in the repeal package’ which would be fine if they were replacement strategies we all agree on like health savings accounts. We all agree on that. Stick that in there, I’m fine with that. Get rid of some of the regulations, I’m fine with that. But I’m just not fine with creating new government programs. And I don’t think conservatives are going to back down on this. Conservatives are going to say, look, if you guys want that I think it’s going to have to be a separate vote.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab0d03a22:988c66:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Several spotlights that illuminate the Statue of Liberty in New York City went dark late Tuesday night, and a multitude of mainstream media outlets tied what appears to be a technical glitch to the left-wing #DayWithoutAWoman protests.

The Washington Post posited that “Lady Liberty was either protesting President Trump generally and, more specifically, his travel ban just a day after he signed the revised executive order limiting entry to the United States from six Muslim-majority countries.”

“… or she was signaling her solidarity with #DayWithoutWomen, a strike scheduled for Wednesday that asks women to skip work to show the world what life would be like without them,” the Post added.

The Associated Press posted raw video of the hour-long outage.

The “unplanned” outage, a National Park Service official said, “was most likely due to work related to an ongoing project to activate a new emergency backup generator which is part of our last remaining Hurricane Sandy recovery projects.”

But that didn’t stop journalists from firing off their feminism-inspired hot takes.

“The very first participant in the Day Without A Woman strike on Wednesday was none other than New York’s most illustrious female, the Lady of Liberty,” writes L.A. Times reporter Barbara Demick.

Other media, including ABC News, CBS News, and NPR, highlighted social media users who speculated that the Lady Liberty blackout was in celebration of International Women’s Day.

Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka told Boston radio talk show host Howie Carr that President Trump wants Congress to investigate Barack Obama’s surveillance of the Trump campaign and transition team based on specific actions and incidents.

“We have identified an incredibly disturbing fact pattern,” said Gorka.

“This is not anything that we have determined; it is a fact pattern that has been reported by British newspapers, by Fox television, the Washington Post, the New York Times,” he said. “That fact pattern leads to the potential of the intelligence community’s elements being exploited by the highest levels for political gain during a campaign season.”

Gorka said he was amused by how Obama’s Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and other staffers from the last administration have taken to the airwaves, social media, and print to denigrate the qualifications of the Trump national security team. “Ben Rhodes was basically a bus driver for the Obama campaign who had a master’s degree in fiction writing.”

Gorka, the author of the 2016 book Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, said the White House trusts Congress to move forward with its investigation.

“We have nothing more to add to this because now we are asking Congress to exercise its oversight mandate and investigate these charges,” he said. “We wish Congress to get to the bottom of this because it is one of the most dangerous things in any democracy when the intelligence community is exploited by politicians for their own political gain.”

Gorka spoke to Carr after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement on the matter:

Reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling. President Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted.

The host of the Howie Carr Show asked Gorka about how he reacts to the statements by former director of national intelligence James Clapper’s flat denial of that the Obama administration ever obtained a warrant from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act judge to wiretap on the Trump team.

“Now, he says there was nothing going on at Trump Tower, do you believe him?” Carr asked.

Carr said Clapper was the man who told Sen. Ron Wyden (D.-Ore.) in 2013 under oath that there was no surveillance of Americans by the federal government–a statement he retracted. “Is he telling the truth this time? Or is he lying again?”

Gorka told Carr that based on Clapper’s track record, there is no way of knowing whether he is telling the truth.

It is also significant to remember that the highest positions in the intelligence committee are filled with political appointees, he said.

“When you look at an individual like Clapper or John Brennan or Ben Rhodes, they may have a background in a specific sphere–expect for Ben Rhodes, of course–but, nevertheless, these are politically appointed individuals and as such, they must be differentiated from the career individuals beneath them, who are just doing their jobs.” John Brennan was Obama’s CIA director.

Gorka, who was worked at the Hungarian defense ministry and was a professor at Washington’s Institue of World Politics before joining the Trump administration, said it is important to recognize that for months there have been loose accusations connecting the Russians with the Trump campaign without any solid evidence.

“There is no smoking gun,” he said. “Nothing. None.”</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">/QqrqwUbF//cEuGZzsLKI5OAnKc2ROuQm3mmMmSaQT8=_15ab0b4a200:95ff0b:5a793d</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Happening Now,” Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) warned against the legislation House Republicans are pushing to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Gohmert explained there were some things they could do to win over his and other House conservatives’ support, but he said the current bill did not go far enough in lowering costs.

“[W]e haven’t had those that are pushing this bill actually realize they need our support,” Gohmert said. “They can get our support, but we need to be at least as bold as we were in 2015. And as I mentioned to President Trump when he was on the House floor during the State of the Union, you are being told there are some things we can’t do under reconciliation that we have already done. And so anyway, it seems like the Byrd rule, or the KKK rule — whatever they call it down in the Senate, it seems more like that is a rule that lets them say we can’t do that because the Byrd rule or whatever. There are a lot of things we can do, and the presiding officer makes that call. But if we don’t get there more important parts of Obamacare repealed, what’s really critical is that prices of the insurance won’t go down. The deductibles won’t go down. It will still be hurting Americans.”

“Now we are told, ‘Well no, with this bill we have, we may be able to get up as high as a 10 percent decrease in the 125 percent or 150 percent decrease,&apos;” he continued. “That’s not going to do it for my constituents. We have to do the right thing in repeal as much of Obamacare as it takes to bring their prices down and to make — give their patients more choices and what they do. It is just unaffordable right now, and I am very concerned that as it is, it is still going to be quite costly. We’re holding out. I learned when President Bush was in the White House — in fact, I told him, ‘Look, you know, I said that I lean yes, you never called me, had me come over to the White House and offered me tea and coffee like these other guys, so from now on, I’m a hard no on everything.’ Then Bush said, ‘Come over to the White House, let’s talk.”

If there is one thing some conservatives are good at, it is ruining a good thing. The Tea Party movement and President Donald J. Trump have successfully delivered to the Republican establishment exactly what they said they wanted: a unified, conservative-led government.

Unfortunately, instead of recognizing victory and unifying to ensure the best conservative ideas are embraced, certain conservative leaders, particularly from the elitist D.C. segment, have decided to line up a good ol’ circular firing squad.

Hours before President Trump took to the stage for his home run speech to the Joint Session of Congress, we heard cheap shots at him about budget rumors – since no presidential budget has been submitted yet. Republican Senators were asserting that any budget that included desperately needed cuts to the bloated State Department would be “dead on arrival.”

They are joined by a group we can only term as Conservative Bubble Boys and Girls. They’re a small, but vocal group of entrenched politicos who have clung to the conservative label as a way to stay relevant in the D.C. bubble.

Regrettably, they spend far too much of their time finding fault with what other conservatives are doing. They’ve been out of touch for so long, it seems like they don’t really know whose team they’re on.

Following President Trump’s speech on Tuesday, I released the following statement:

Since 2012, Tea Party Express has hosted the official Tea Party response to the President’s address. Last night was the first night that our address wasn’t necessary. Not because the ideas of limited government and economic growth have fallen out of vogue – because they surely haven’t – but because that speech was delivered on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives by the President of the United States. President Trump delivered an eloquent address, where he clearly and deliberately laid out his conservative vision for America. It should now be clear to everyone that the Tea Party movement is more than rallies and protests. We have arrived in D.C., through our elected representatives, to fulfill our mission and finally rein in government.

But instead of covering this milestone for the conservative movement, the Bubble Boys and Girls used it to write the Tea Party’s obituary, claiming that we were dead because we somehow embraced a big government agenda void of a conservative vision. Huh?

The Weekly Standard published the piece “RIP, Tea Party: 2009-2017,” and claimed, “The anti-establishment movement embraces big government.” Why? Because they claim the President did not outline specific budget cuts, but only talked about spending priorities. Thus, they conclude—before a single piece of legislation is introduced—that he is a “big government conservative.”

Then, a senior editor at National Review asserted, “Maybe I’m crazy, but I’d bet that if President Obama (or a President Jeb Bush) had made a similar speech with similar spending commitments and no explanation of how to pay for them, the Tea Party Express would have mustered enough objections to respond.”

Yes, the National Review writer is right. We had no confidence that Barack Obama was going to rein in the size and cost of government; we would have proudly stood with Jeb Bush if he had a Trump-like cabinet. We would have given a lot of room to a President who had appointed Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, or Scott Pruitt to the EPA or Tom Price to head up HHS.

Furthermore, both authors oddly marginalized the President’s pro-growth agenda, which includes historic tax cuts, massive regulatory reform, and bold education changes that will affect millions of children across the nation. And that doesn’t even touch the Administration’s unequivocal commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare. These are major conservative priorities—and priorities that have defined the Tea Party movement—but the Bubble Boys and Girls won’t let facts get in the way of an opportunity to bash the President.

Admittedly, there are plenty of details to work through as the Administration and Congress prepare to honor the promises they made to voters. And none of us are under any illusion that we’ll be happy with 100 percent of every decision made. If the President or Congress deviates from the will of the voters, we should call them out—I know that Tea Party Express will.

However, instead of impulsively attacking President Trump and fellow conservatives, let’s try to keep our powder dry and wait for there to be a fight. Maybe that way we will be ready and united to actually win some of the impending battles and deliver the best solutions for conservatives.
