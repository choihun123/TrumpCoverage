WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump signed a scaled-back travel ban that addresses some of the legal challenges to his original executive order, while blocking new visas for people living in six Muslim-majority nations and suspending admission of refugees to the U.S.

U.S. companies are girding for fallout from the Trump administration’s moves to tighten immigration enforcement, with farmers, food companies and builders among those bracing for possible deportations of workers that some fear could leave businesses short-staffed.

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump delivered what historians and speechwriters said was one of the most ominous inaugural addresses ever, reinforcing familiar campaign themes of American decline while positioning himself as the protector of the country’s “forgotten men and women.”

In a speech that his predecessors had famously used to inspire Americans to place country before self and urged them to fear only fear itself, Mr. Trump on...</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">DEUBPWKu2h3g63N0Qw80dXLhKKgRkd++zx6M4zVnf5w=_159beaab4ff:863e5d:93371e27</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">DALLAS—As pressure mounts on local officials to comply with tighter immigration policies after President Donald Trump took aim at so-called sanctuary cities, a standoff is brewing between the Texas governor and a county sheriff.

A thicket of U.S. Supreme Court rulings could limit the reach of the executive order issued by President Donald Trump last week meant to prod “sanctuary cities” into helping the federal government enforce immigration law.

President Donald Trump triggered the biggest diplomatic rift between the U.S. and Mexico in decades, engaging in a sharp-edged Twitter exchange Thursday that led the Mexican president to cancel a visit to Washington next week.

The White House later floated the idea of a 20% import tax to pay for a wall along the length of the Mexican border. Mr. Trump has vowed that Mexico will pay—in some form—for the full cost of the wall.

In a bid to repair a rift with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, President Donald Trump agreed on Friday to stop speaking publicly about one of his signature campaign promises: that Mexico would pay for the construction of a wall along the U.S. border.

The concession was detailed in the joint U.S.-Mexico statement after the two leaders had an hour-long phone call, but not in the White House’s version. A White House official said Mr. Trump did indeed agree to stop talking publicly about Mexico paying for the wall,...</newspaper_article_text><id type="str">DEUBPWKu2h3g63N0Qw80dXLhKKgRkd++zx6M4zVnf5w=_159e16d9951:3a949d8:c9473c70</id></item><item type="dict"><newspaper_article_text type="str">Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey will stay in his role under President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the discussions.
