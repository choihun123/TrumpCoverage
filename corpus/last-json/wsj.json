Hourly earnings rose 2.8% across all professions over the same period, according to the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe warehouse and storage sector expanded dramatically as more people shop online, and accounted for 945,200 jobs in March, up 5.3% over the year-earlier period, according to seasonally adjusted Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.\n\nWarehouse workers typically earn a few dollars an hour above minimum wage, though minimum-wage laws in places like California and Massachusetts could narrow the gap.\n\nLuis Ramirez, 26, collects merchandise from stock shelves to fulfill internet orders at the Redlands warehouse, which Radial operates for retail chain Zara. Photo: Andrew Cullen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nBooming sales mean e-commerce operations have to ship more items faster, and pay increases are imposing new costs. E-commerce fulfillment centers require two to three times as many workers as traditional warehouses, says CBRE Group Inc., a real-estate brokerage. It estimates a $1-an-hour wage increase can raise labor costs by more than $2 million a year at \u201cbig box\u201d warehouses employing as many as 1,000 workers.\n\nMany new facilities Amazon.com Inc. is opening around the country have 2,000 or more full-time employees, an Amazon spokeswoman said. The e-commerce giant, which has more than 90,000 full-time workers across its fulfillment network, said Thursday it plans to create 25,000 additional part-time warehouse jobs over the next year.\n\nRising labor costs are speeding up the pace of automation and influencing where new warehouses are built. And as poaching becomes a bigger threat, employers are trying to make picker jobs more attractive, with perks like employee barbecues and holiday breakfasts, as well as more-flexible shifts.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to lure workers away. \u201cA guy who makes $10 an hour, you offer $10.25, he\u2019s going to leave,\u201d said Tom Landry, president of Allegiance Staffing, which supplies logistics and manufacturing workers. \u201cThat\u2019s another tank of gas.\u201d\n\nEmployees prep and ship internet orders at packing stations in the Redlands distribution center.\n\nSome warehouse operators are adding part-time positions or compressed shifts that pack 36 hours of work into three days, in hopes of luring students, working parents or retirees. Some firms are tapping local organizations and community colleges. Incentives deployed each fall for the holiday rush, like performance pay, are becoming more common year-round.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like peak [season] is never ending,\u201d said Meghan Henson, chief human resources officer at XPO Logistics Inc., which operates warehouses for large retailers like IKEA. \u201cIf a warehouse is going up down the block, we want to find out what they\u2019re paying.\u201d\n\nAmazon.com and online furniture retailer Wayfair Inc. have opened warehouses near Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. The delivery companies FedExCorp., United Parcel Service Inc. and Deutsche Post AG\u2019s DHL also have operations in the area. Average pay in 2015 for freight and stock employees, such as warehouse pickers, in the Cincinnati metro area shot up to more than $14 an hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFinding enough workers \u201cis certainly a concern,\u201d said Dan Tobergte, chief executive of Northern Kentucky Tri-ED, a regional economic development agency. We\u2019ve got pretty low unemployment in the area,\u201d he said, and the population isn\u2019t \u201cgrowing as fast as the jobs are.\u201d\n\nCompetition for labor is intense in areas such as Southern California\u2019s Inland Empire and Central Pennsylvania, within a day\u2019s reach of millions of consumers. Demand is heating up in Midwestern cities like Indianapolis and St. Louis, according to commercial real-estate services firm JLL.\n\nRadial, which handles e-commerce fulfillment for retailers like Kate Spade & Co. and DSW Inc., increased wages at eight U.S. locations in December, including raises of between 5% and 7% at a facility in Redlands, Calif.\n\n\u201cLast year was really the tipping point for us,\u201d said Robyn Jordan, senior director of human resources for Radial\u2019s global operations.\n\nLuis Ramirez, 26 years old, \u200bjoined Radial in 2014, after hearing it was paying $10 an hour at a new distribution center for Zara, a retail unit of Inditex SA . That was 50 cents an hour more than he earned at a warehouse job he got through a staffing agency.\u200b\n\nMr. Ramirez earned a $200 attendance bonus during the\u200brecent holiday season and said Zara gives out $100 gift cards at the end of the year. Employees also can get paid more if they exceed targets during busy times, when apparel goes on sale. \u201cFor picking, the rate is 65 [clothing items] an hour,\u201d Mr. Ramirez said. Workers who exceed 70 items an hour \u201cget a dollar extra for every hour you hit that rate.\u201d He said he plans to stay\u200bat Radial for now.\n\nNancy Loera packs items to be shipped from the Redlands warehouse. Radial recently raised pay at the warehouse by 5% to 7%.\n\nRaising pay can reduce employee turnover and save companies money on training. Experienced workers tend to be more productive, said David Caines, chief operating officer at logistics provider Kenco.\n\nSome companies are investing in automated systems so their facilities can handle more orders without hiring additional staff. Software can direct workers to the right shelf faster and reduce errors.\n\nRead More Get the latest news and analysis on logistics and supply-chain issues via a daily newsletter, at WSJ.com/Logistics.\n\nA new Kohl\u2019s Corp. e-commerce fulfillment center in Indiana will be \u201cthree times as productive as our existing fulfillment centers, given the level of automation,\u201d the company said in February.\n\n\u201cWe used to do maybe one highly automated distribution center out of 10,\u201d said Steve Osburn, a managing director at consulting firm Kurt Salmon, an Accenture subsidiary. \u201cNow it\u2019s 80% of the DCs that we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\nAppeared in the Apr. 10, 2017, print edition as 'Online Retailers Heat Up Local Labor Markets.'", "alternate": [{"href": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-retailers-new-warehouses-heat-up-local-job-markets-1491739203?mod=rss_US_News", "type": "text/html"}], "summary": {"content": "As e-commerce retailers, led by Amazon.com Inc., build giant distribution centers to keep up with surging online sales, they are competing for workers to fill thousands of new jobs.", "direction": "ltr"}, "visual": {"contentType": "image/jpeg", "edgeCacheUrl": "http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9iMq7jeIEQmSMgcCwRmpn8Y4eo8FNjr5DUETqCpEeKI0BO6ZnXkTrqLJfTmRjTPuZw8YkIKhImS3A32hmlzAvkB4", "url": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-SW493_WAREHO_TOP_20170407174248.jpg", "height": 350, "width": 700, "expirationDate": 1497004943362, "processor": "feedly-nikon-v3.1"}, "originId": "SB12505117543495144839404583063010847377422", "fingerprint": "63a9ee75", "keywords": ["FREE"], "_id": {"$oid": "5919ebffec03f91c9c7eb0c2"}, "id": "DEUBPWKu2h3g63N0Qw80dXLhKKgRkd++zx6M4zVnf5w=_15b54bb425e:1a306f0:afcb5334", "unread": true, "published": 1491774832000}, {"origin": {"streamId": "feed/http://online.wsj.com/xml/rss/3_8068.xml", "htmlUrl": "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-world-business.html", "title": "WSJ.com US News"}, "engagement": 10, "canonicalUrl": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-governor-legislature-reach-budget-agreement-1491625915", "title": "New York Governor, Legislature Reach Budget Agreement", "crawled": 1491653164512, "newspaper_article_text": "ALBANY, N.Y.\u2014Gov.

The ports of Savannah and Norfolk, Va., are proposing to discuss coordination of some operations. Photo: Stephen B. Morton/Associated Press\n\nU.S. seaports are joining forces, setting aside decades of regional competition over cargo as a wave of consolidation in the shipping industry threatens to cut some cities out of global trade routes.\n\nShipping regulators are reviewing a proposal by the port authorities of Georgia and Virginia to discuss coordinating some operations, including investments in new equipment and negotiations with shipping lines. The ports of Seattle and Tacoma, Wash. merged most operations in 2015. The nation\u2019s busiest ports, in Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., are sharing more data since severe congestion brought operations to a near halt along the West Coast two years ago.\n\nThe deals are a response to unprecedented consolidation in the shipping industry. The world\u2019s top ocean carriers have formed three alliances that went into operation at the start of this month and will control 90% of shipments on major global trade routes. They plan to save money by packing more cargo on larger ships that make fewer stops.\n\nMany ports, fearful that they would be left out of shipping routes, are investing billions of dollars to dredge deeper harbors and install bigger cranes to handle the new class of megaships. Consolidation among U.S. ports is the logical next step, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe shipping alliances have all the power,\u201d said Geraldine Knatz, who was executive director of the Port of Los Angeles until January 2014 and is now a professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop fighting against each other, and try instead to build some leverage.\u201d\n\nStill, many secondary ports are investing heavily to stay competitive. The Port of Miami recently spent more than $1 billion on a deeper channel and other improvements, and expects volume would more than double by 2035. South Carolina\u2019s Port of Charleston, the eighth-busiest U.S. port, is spending $2 billion to break into the top five by 2020.\n\nThe move toward partnerships underscores the stark choices facing ports on both coasts: beef up to handle big ships or get left behind. At stake are thousands of jobs and the livelihoods of importers, exporters and freight and logistics businesses that cluster around major ports.\n\nPort terminals in Portland, Ore., Oakland, Calif. and elsewhere were idled last year, but shipping lines called other ports on the West Coast and overall container volume to the region\u2019s ports rose in 2016. In Europe, ports in Belgium and Spain saw cargo volumes drop after ports in the U.K., Netherlands and Germany added capacity.\n\nSeattle and Tacoma, now operating as the Northwest Seaport Alliance, pool money and make infrastructure investments together. Last year, the ports handled 9% more loaded containers, compared with a 4% increase at Southern California\u2019s two ports and a 0.1% drop at the Port of Vancouver, British Columbia, the closest large port to Seattle.\n\nThe ports of Savannah, Ga., and Norfolk, Va., the second- and third-largest East Coast container ports by volume, respectively, would continue to operate separately under their agreement, but would share some information such as what equipment they plan to buy and which types of cargo they would go after. This could allow the ports to complement each other by specializing in different kinds of cargo, rather than compete.\n\nPort officials in Georgia and Virginia declined to comment. The Federal Maritime Commission, which regulates ocean trade, has until mid-April to raise objections or request further details before the agreement goes into effect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more port discussion and cooperation agreements in the U.S.,\u201d said Federal Maritime Commissioner William Doyle. The East Coast Gateway agreement, as the Georgia-Virginia pact is known, is a \u201cfirst step\u201d toward broader coordination \u201cthat could lead to an alliance agreement if the synergies make sense,\u201d he said.\n\nFor retailers and manufacturing companies, port alliances could narrow shipping options, leaving fewer alternative ways to move goods if a port closes for weather or becomes too congested. But the use of bigger ships could keep freight rates close to their recent all-time lows for shippers, as they allow shipping lines to move more cargo on fewer trips, saving money on fuel and labor.\n\nThe Northwest Seaport Alliance has attracted \u201cbigger ships and bigger companies,\u201d said Dean Polik, president of food importer Acme Foods Inc. in Seattle. That has helped Acme, which can count on ships making regular calls, plus a strong regional network of warehouses, freight transportation and other logistics operations, he said.\n\n\u201cThis has allowed the port community to stay afloat,\u201d Mr. Polik said.\n\nWrite to Erica E.

Tzanakaki ran to the bridge, knowing a collision could put lives and millions of dollars in cargo at risk.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of noise\u2014the alarm, men yelling as they stumbled out of bed,\u201d she said of that April 2013 morning. \u201cI screamed \u2018Full speed ahead!\u2019\u2026We broke the moorings holding us in place and avoided a collision that could have caused a blaze.\u201d No one was hurt.\n\nFor a woman to face such a challenge as commander is a rarity on a Greek ship. According to data from the country\u2019s merchant marine ministry, only 17 of the 2,704 people named captains since 2010 have been women. Greece is the No. 1 ship-owning nation by tonnage, controlling about a fifth of the world\u2019s merchant fleet, despite its multiyear debt crisis. Its lack of women at the helm and in the ranks reflects the situation world-wide, with women making up about 2% of the global shipping workforce, according to the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation.\n\nCapt. Tzanakaki was hailed by her crew for her handling of the incident. \u201cShe made the right call in Beirut and saved the ship and maybe our lives,\u201d said Manolis Marinakis, who served as her second in command at the time. \u201cIt was an honor to work with her.\u201d\n\nDespite the accolades and relatively high pay\u2014when traveling, Capt. Tzanakaki earns up to 10 times the average monthly salary for a Greek adult \u2014few women heed the sea\u2019s call. At Greece\u2019s 10 merchant-marine academies, there is one woman for every five men.\n\nIoannis Theotokas, the ministry\u2019s general secretary, said he has encouraged shipowners to employ more women, and the ministry has organized events with female officers talking about the rewards of the career. \u201cBut progress is slow,\u201d he said.\n\nShipping officials cite the demands and frequent isolation of the profession, as well as an entrenched, male-dominated culture, for the disparity.\n\n\u201cA female officer at sea must put twice the effort to persuade her employers that she can do the same job as a man,\u201d said Venetia Kallipolitou, head of maritime studies at the merchant marine ministry, who holds the rank of captain, second class. \u201cShips are unwelcoming for women as a workplace,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a taboo that won\u2019t be easy to overcome.\u201d\n\nThe career is often seen as an obstacle to starting a family, said Katerina Ioannou, a 24-year-old Captain C class, the No. 3 position on a ship.\n\n\u201cShipping companies invest thousands to train you as a captain, but after a few months at sea, many girls ask for desk jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cThis makes employers reluctant to promote them.\u201d\n\nTrips routinely last six months or more, and a ship master is always on call, managing what is usually an all-male crew. In addition to commanding the ship\u2019s crew under way, she is responsible for reporting the ship\u2019s position and status to her employer and the cargo owners, as well as overseeing everything from engine repairs to payroll.\n\nDuring quiet periods, Capt. Tzanakaki organizes cooking competitions and karaoke nights for the crew, but other times, commotion and conflict are part of the job. \u201cA ship is no Sunday school,\u201d she said. \u201cTension flares up. I break up arguments and sometimes even fistfights among the crew over many things, some as trivial as who has to do the dishes.\u201d\n\nSexual harassment is an area of concern for women in the industry, said Karin Orsel, president of the Women\u2019s International Shipping and Trading Association, a networking organization for female managers.\n\n\u201cWhen it happens in an environment where you are at sea, and isolated from resources or the ability to extricate oneself, it becomes even more concerning. Industry is looking at this issue in search of solutions,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Greek merchant-marine ministry\u2019s Mr. Theotokas said that sexual-harassment cases are taken seriously and have mostly involved cruise ships or ferries. \u201cWe know that some incidents go unreported,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on oceangoing vessels when you have a single officer, incidents are very rare.\u201d\n\nMs. Ioannou said she hasn\u2019t faced any problems during her 36 months at sea, though she said \u201cI dress like a man, in large T-shirts and wide pants or overalls. No manicures, lipstick or makeup and I keep my hair tied up.\u201d\n\nMale junior officers sometimes bristle at her commands, however.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Greek thing. Greek boys have big egos,\u201d Ms. Ioannou said. \u201cBut the job gets done at the end.\u201d\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "alternate": [{"href": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-captains-command-respect-but-not-many-ships-1486994401?mod=rss_US_News", "type": "text/html"}], "summary": {"content": "Female officers remain a rare sight on Greek-owned ships and world-wide, despite efforts to encourage more women to heed the sea\u2019s call.", "direction": "ltr"}, "visual": {"url": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-RX086_FEMALE_G_20170131174710.jpg", "width": 553, "contentType": "image/jpeg", "processor": "feedly-nikon-v3.1", "height": 369}, "ampUrl": "http://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/female-captains-command-respect-but-not-many-ships-1486994401", "cdnAmpUrl": "https://cdn.ampproject.org/c/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/female-captains-command-respect-but-not-many-ships-1486994401", "originId": "SB11072784632651033450604582577461791403018", "fingerprint": "14e56465", "keywords": ["FREE"], "_id": {"$oid": "5919ebffec03f91c9c7eb52f"}, "id": "DEUBPWKu2h3g63N0Qw80dXLhKKgRkd++zx6M4zVnf5w=_15a39fe8fad:b8ba3e3:c9473c70", "unread": true, "published": 1487002310000}, {"origin": {"streamId": "feed/http://online.wsj.com/xml/rss/3_8068.xml", "htmlUrl": "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-world-business.html", "title": "WSJ.com US News"}, "engagement": 752, "canonicalUrl": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gdp-grew-1-9-in-fourth-quarter-1485524015", "title": "U.S. GDP Grew 1.9% in Fourth Quarter", "crawled": 1485556571492, "newspaper_article_text": "The U.S. ended 2016 on a familiar trajectory of roughly 2% economic growth, the lackluster trend that has prevailed through most of the current expansion and which President Donald Trump is seeking to double in the face of stubborn long-term headwinds.\n\nGross domestic product, a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the economy, expanded at an inflation and seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.9% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the Commerce Department said Friday.
